@sonalisamal2009,"Their attitude and dedication is what makes them stand out. They give their everything to their songs and choreography. They don't give you a chance to say things like ""oh, this one had so much potential but missed by a beat"", or ""this would have made it better "", because they fully utilise their potential. You can totally feel the energy from across the screen. I love how they don't have a laid back attitude when it comes to their work. Despite having massive popularity and fans, they still harbour the rookie attitude and work as hard, which is the sign of a true artiste. ❤ I love this so so much.

It's so beautiful and touching that this group still puts the same effort and radiates the same energy after all those years. I'm so glad they renewed their contract.

@Jen-dg4tm,"To be synced I believe is not a difficult matter because through practice it can be achieved. But to be synced in a DETAILED - and again emphasizing detailed - choreo is the most difficult task, especially with 13 members.

I have watched so many choreographies but SVT is the only kpop group who makes such aesthetic, storytelling, extremely detailed choreos. They even beat dance teams which specialize solely on dance. Whereas SVT has to implicate everything in one performance. They are literally breathtaking and I am disappointed on myself because at first I was looking down on them due to the excessive amount of members. But now I totally see how each member contributes to the group. Their chemistry is totally insane and the fact that everybody is so humble makes everything so much better.


P.S. My only wish (which I am pretty sure it will never become true) is to play with them. They are such a moodmaker which I wish I had friends like them.",1,2022-03-07T18:20:40Z

@singingpotato7410,"their synchronization is really crazy, i know this the first time someone said this. i mean it's really crazy and add the fact they have *thirteen* members which means they have thirteen more times to make a mistake and they don't is amazing, having a lot of members and not being synchronize can look really bad you will clearly see if one could not keep up, but in this group you will never see a dance hole everyone is a great dancers and with the facr they have to sing and rap while doing these hard choreos just makes me so confused why people still sleeps on them, they deserve to be one of the biggest boy group and they will be.

@yulizanunez2296,"This is very off topic but I have been a kpop fan for about 6 ish years now and seventeen was one of the first groups I discovered, at a young age, when I learned about kpop. It’s been about a year and a half that I found myself slowly distancing myself from kpop as I just got so busy with my person life and school (as I’m preparing for college). I was just scrolling on YouTube watching dance practice from other groups and decided to watch seventeen as I haven’t seen any of their content in a very long time, and I got very emotional suddenly while watching them dance and enjoy themselves. I realized that energy and passion for what they do can cause us to feel so much joy as fans. I don’t know, but this video of them made me so happy and made me realize why I love them so much. Thank you for listening lol have a great day!! :)",22,2022-01-16T11:33:25Z

Me pregunto si el fandoms de este grupo me podría decir sus nombres y en qué minuto aparecen, me gustaría al menos conocer sus nombres, se me hace muy emotivo ver su coreografía, como entre todos se distribuyen un espacio, también para cantar, en verdad me sorprende, me encanta la parte en que todos los integrantes se agrupan y cantan en coro y con entusiasmo :), esta canción es una belleza 100\100 🤍",3,2021-12-01T19:34:17Z

@에디-x3r,"아니 타팬이지만 세븐틴 안무 진짜 딱딱 잘 맞는거 쾌감 오지네요
칼군무 대박…. 안무영상보고 안무 어떻게 연습했는지 보고싶어서 찾아봤는데 바로바로 캐치해서 안무따는거랑 디테일 까지 하나하나 맞추는거보고 그래 이렇게 하니까 칼군무가 오지는거지 이생각했네요!
근데 저렇게 잘하는 팀한테 연습실을 예약해서 써야한다는 소식을 들었는데 그게 말이야 방구야 캐럿인 친구말로는 지박령 처럼 연습실에서 살다시피 연습을 빡세게 한다던데
그런 팀한테 예약을 하라니…. 지금도 그런가요….?
암튼 진짜 칼군무 쾌감 오졌습니다. 저 그리고 그 안무 있잖아요 안무영상을 우연히 봤는데 바닥에 선 테이프 붙여놓고 누워가지고 몇명은 선에 눕고 몇명은 선과 선 안에 누웠고 한명은 일어나서 안무하는데 다른사람 일어날때였나 누워있는 상태에서 돌았는데 고대로 똑같이 몇명은 선에 눕고 몇명은 선과 선 안에 누운거 그거보고 진짜 대박이라고 생각했어요 진짜 저거 하나 맞추려고 얼마나 노력했을지 눈에보이니까
세븐틴이 2015년에 데뷔한걸로 아는데 ( 맞나요….? ) 암튼 6~7년이 되었음에도 불구하고 초심 잃지 않고 뭐든 열심히 하는 모습이 보기좋네요~
타팬이지만 그점 칭찬하고 갑니다 이 팀은 퍼포먼스도 작사 작곡도 다 본인들이 다 한다면서요?
우리 비투비 처럼 자체 제작돌이라고 들었는데 인기 있는거 다 알지만 더 인기 있으셨으면 좋겠고 올해는 연말시상식에서 모든 상 다 휩쓰셨으면 좋겠네요 특히 퍼포먼스상!!!!
솔직히 HIT 때 퍼포상 세븐틴 한테 줬어야 한다는 타팬 1인 ( 괜히 인기투표인냥 투표하게 해가지고…. 크흠…. )
이상 비투비 데뷔팬이 끄적이 주접? 이었습니다 세븐틴 응원합니다!! ( 요즘 저 세븐틴 영상 알고리즘으로 떠서 보고 찾아서도보고 하는데 입덕부정기 인가요….? ㅋㅋ 언젠가 완전히 스며들어서 캐럿이 되는 그날까지 응원은 계속 하겠습니다! )
아참! 요즘 우연히 락윗유를 들었는데 자꾸 입에서 맴돌고 중독성 갑이라서 매일 듣고있습니다! 우지님 후반에 고음 장난아니던데 다들 높은곡을 라이브로 소화하면서도 어떻게 춤을 그렇게 잘추는지 와아…. 우지님이 리드보컬 이라면서요? 아니 엑소도 메인보컬 세명인데 세븐틴도 그냥 메인보컬 세명으로 하시지…. 세븐틴 다들 목소리 절대지켜! 관절 절대지켜!

@vindicatedtruth,"There were Naver articles published about SEVENTEEN on how what makes them standout from the industry is that they never changed: they still perform as if they're rookies, with just as much drive and passion. Too often senior artists become complacent over time because of their status and popularity, but SEVENTEEN is different in that their performance level has remained consistent throughout their entire career, AND constantly improving and being fine-tuned.

They declare it themselves quite often too, that they hope they will never lose that ""rookie mindset"", and it really does show in everything they do: from their humility, their welcoming openness to their fellow Kpop idols of all generations, their active involvement in all aspects of their career, the way they practice and perform as hard as if they're just about to debut next month.

Their professionalism and discipline in their craft, coupled with the sincerity of their artistry and the joyful energy they have as a group, shows all the more starkly here in their Rock With You choreography. The passion and love for what they do—and their undying commitment to their Carats—is exactly what this performance is all about.",5843,2021-11-06T14:35:35Z
@vindicatedtruth,"A computer algorithm once concluded that SEVENTEEN is the most synchronized idol group in the industry (even across generations), with almost a 96% accuracy, which is as humanly close to perfection as possible.

Synchronization is no joke especially for a group of 13 members, because that's thirteen times the chance of having mistakes, and yet there's no other group currently in the industry who executes that knife-life synchronization the way they do. Once you get to observe for yourself the ""SEVENTEEN STANDARD"" in performing, you'll start to view other performances by other idols by that standard, and realise just how almost impossibly high SEVENTEEN has set it for the industry to follow. 

And yet what makes the dance practice behind videos such those on INSIDE SEVENTEEN all the more important to reveal is because that standard of near-perfection doesn't come easy. It comes with the absolute discipline in honing even the littlest details in their choreography—down to the angle of their arms and the timing of their gestures—and as they clearly demonstrate in those behind-the-scenes: practicing even to the point of absolute exhaustion.

It's the kind of reverence and respect that only SEVENTEEN can inspire, because even after seven years in the industry, and ten years practicing together since pre-debut, they have never let themselves be complacent in their craft.

SEVENTEEN is the standard of performance because they set it so highly, first and foremost, for THEMSELVES.",3698,2021-11-06T14:30:49Z

Also the reason why this choreo ressemble so many elements from their older choreo is they are reviewing their journey from debut day, just like the album trailer use a lot of elements from their older MVs and the Da Capo Al Fine thing they released before this Attacca album, they used music terms to tell their message: repeat from beginning to end and keep going on without stopping.

@1604호루디네,"13명 무대와 11명 무대 굉장히 다르구나 11명 무대에 익숙해졌다가 13명 무대 보니까 완전히 새로운 무대처럼 보이는 구간들이 있다 
그런데 어쨌던 13명 무대가 완성작인 것 같네! 

멤버들 동선 2개 따느라 힘들었을 텐데 그래도 13명 무대가 이렇게 완벽하게 짜여져 있다는게 
큰 의미인 것 같다

@Charchan-hi2hg,They filmed the dance practice in rush so they could film the MV with 13 members before China-line flew out. So the details of dancing were still lacking and their formation changed a lots from their actually stages. But the synchronization!!! They already dance so in sync in such a short amount of time to practice!!! That's insane!!!,9,2021-10-26T09:22:34Z

steps:
1. watch the members individually first, so basically 13 members= 13 times of streaming
2. watch the video as a whole=1
3. watch again the video the medial perspective=1
4. watch the video in the lateral areas. so there are 2 sides= 2 stream
5. watch again as a  group=1

Nevertheless, it's still amazing like holy moly amazing~ I meant...learning the move while still in RTL promotion and recorded this just after RTL promotion ended FOR THE SAKE of 13 members choreography video is truly amazing. I and I bet all CARATS really hope the choreography video have 13 members and they really gve to us. Standing applause to all 13 members :)",0,2021-10-26T01:45:30Z

@moe.i913,"This cool and unique choreography reminds  me  of the lyrics of some of their songs. 

0:53 “step on air and ascend into the sky” - MOONWALKER

1:14 “knock the door/ hey buddy, come out” - HEY BUDDY

1:43 “even without water, we'll row oars on the ground” - Back it up.

I guess this song alludes to Le Petit Prince (The Little Prince) and Terre des Hommes (Wind, Sand, and Stars). 
THE 8  is the prince. MINGYU is “I,” the alter-ego of Saint-Exupery, and Vernon plays the role of  Prevot, the engineer who crash-landed in the desert with him.",0,2021-10-25T18:24:42Z

Seeing now the position of Woozi and Jun I understand why it seemed to me that Woozi was late to cover him in the performance, his original position is on the other side and he has Vernon in the middle.",0,2021-10-25T16:41:31Z

@vedalakshmi2407,"The only thing I say every time I see Seventeen’s choreography is

~SMOOTH~

Cuz even though it seems so easy, I’m reality I never end up doing them right.
The moves are not only sharp and precise but also fluid and smooth.

Each choreography is unique and mesmerizing to watching in itself own way
From few that I watched a lot :

Hit - Power packed
Very Nice - Bit funny and goofy
Fallin flower - Many moves with team work 
Don’t wanna cry - Touching 
Left and Right - Addictive",10,2021-10-25T16:16:30Z

[Personalization] 
TO CARATS:

You all made who we are now 
We want to give you everything 
Without you, we are nothing. 

No words are enough to express our feelings for all of you…
We want to right it lyrical, 
We want to keep it melodical
So let me read and write my emotions through you
We will also listen to all your emotions

We just want to love you
We won't leave you alone

Together, our time is short,  so we will not take it for granted. 

Every moment is pointing to you
All we ever need is you
Take nothing for granted you're all we got
We will not break your heart 

Where ever we are, wherever we go
We wanna ride with you

Carats hold on, even if the world is ending we're still gonna sing for all of you ( I wanna rock with you) 
We want to stay with you 💘😭😭
