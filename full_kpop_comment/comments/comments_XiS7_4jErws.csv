@mr.rover26,"Oh dude, this album means so much to me, I can't even explain with the words, it contains so much personal stuff, sincerity and true emotions of taeyong. I can relate to it soo much, I cry everytime I listen to ruby, 404 file not found and back to the past. I'm so lost right know and no one has any idea how much this album and Taeyong himself helps me, his songs and him are my light in this moment. Back to the past and 404 not found became my comfort songs which I listen to everyday. Thank you so much and love you Taeyong and everyone for this album. Both of your albums and songs means everything for me, they're just masterpieces🙌
Thank you and again thank you always and forever 🙌
Thank you for being my light, hope and comfort with your songs Lee Taeyong. You really mean a lot to me. Sorry if there are a lot of mistakes cuz I'm really emotional right now.",1,2024-07-17T19:09:22Z

@bambamthemenace8000,"After seeing the process and the thoughts behind every single song on this album, I have a feeling that I'm going to have a special connection to each song in a different way. Whenever an artist puts their soul and emotions into lyrics or songs in general, they seem to come out better and have something that other albums don't. I also love how Taeyong put an optimistic message at the end of every one of his song explanations as a way to tell people that you can have hardships and go through dark times but there is always a light on the flip side of that darkness. Albums that have time and dedication put into them make me respect artists even more than I did before. The realness of the songs is going to create such an amazing collection of songs that I can't wait to listen to.",0,2023-05-29T16:32:20Z

@amnaeyad7290,"I'm probably late now but I'm totally In love with this film. I like it much better than the usual high end set & probs promo videos.
This album is the most hand on the most personal gift we received from him & it shows how Taeyong is his own league and is above  the limitation of the idol title but a very all rounder perfect artist. They way every song is a story on itself and a meaningful sentimental one at that. I cried when he mentioned Ruby & Back to the past & the art portray of his family hugging him was so warming and devastating for me at the same time considering everything he went through.
I'm more than proud with how far he's come , his existence on its own is truly a gift & blessing.
You deserve to have the best of this world & I hope you continue making music with a full wide green forest of a mind & heart.
I love you so much.",5,2023-05-24T23:16:45Z

@markys99,"Meu deus eu tô chorandoKSKSKSKS- Eu acho que agora caiu a ficha. O TAEYONG DO NCT VAI FINALMENTE FAZER A SUA ESTREIA SOLO, AAAAAAAAAAA!!! Tipo, eu tenho tanta coisa pra falar desse homem. Se não fosse pelo Taeyong, eu tenho 100% de certeza que eu não estaria no fandom do NCT. Eu não seria uma Nctzen. Eu lembro perfeitamente. Eu tinha aquele pôster do NCT 2018, não conhecia ninguém, mas tinha um ali, no meio de todos eles, que me chamava a atenção pelo simples fato de ter cabelo vermelho. Apartir dali, disse que o Taeyong seria o meu utt do NCT, sem ao menos conhecê-lo. Me aprofundei mais no NCT, e percebi que uma das pessoas mais importantes dentro do grupo era o Taeyong. Ele é tudo no NCT. Líder, rapper, dancer, vocalista, compositor, visual, face, coreógrafo, produtor, pintor, etc...!!! O Taeyong é DEFINITIVAMENTE um dos MAIORES idols que esse kpop já teve. Ele é o maior, e sabe disso. Ele é completo, e não há nada que esse homem não possa fazer. Desde o início eu sabia que o Taeyong seria o primeiro solista do NCT, mas mesmo assim, eu não paro de me surpreender. Nesse vídeo, eu vi a indentidade do Taeyong. E é por isso que eu estou TÃO ansiosa pra esse debut. Porque eu posso ver que o Taeyong é individualmente um artista único, que tem a própria essência, a própria cor. Falando só sobre suas músicas, há uma que me conforta tanto, tanto, tanto. É inexplicável. ""Blue"". Não há palavras que possam descrever o meu amor por essa música. Ela me ajudou e me ajuda tanto em momentos difíceis. E é mais um dos motivos do porquê de eu precisar desse debut solo. Eu sei que vai me fazer bem. Vai me confortar, vai me fazer feliz, porque é o Taeyong. Tudo nele me faz feliz. Ele é sinceramente um dos meus maiores portos seguros, e eu tô muito, muito, muito orgulhosa de estar vivendo isso. Ele é particularmente um homem que passou por diversas coisas, e ver que agora ele pode finalmente mostrar tudo o que ele é atrás desse álbum... Meu deus, que ORGULHO. Eu te amo tanto Bubu, você me faz tão bem. :( Espero que sempre seja feliz, independente de tudo. Eu te amo. Pra sempre.💚",2,2023-05-24T07:48:34Z

@primaverala8300,"태용이는 진짜 완전 풀패키지... 오늘 네이버기사에서도 유사한 얘기하는 걸 읽었는데 완벽한 정육각형 풀충 능력치라고 
정말 자랑스러워 우리태용이 
이렇게나 꽉꽉 채운 너의 첫앨범과 여전히 잔뜩 쌓여있을 너의 작업곡들, 앞으로의 앨범 모두 너무너무 기대돼!!! 
건강 관리 철저히 해서 오래오래오래 활동해줘야해 평생 간다 알았지?",5,2023-05-24T03:19:11Z
@백장미-z8x,"태용이는 정말 다 가진 것 같아 늘 보면서 믿을 수 없어 
얘는 어쩜 이렇게 생겼지? 얘는 어쩜 이렇게 춤을 잘 추지? 어쩜 이렇게 랩을, 가사를, 곡도 만든다고?? 노래까지 잘하네???
널 보면 설레고 네가 가는 길이 기대돼 
누굴 좋아하면서 태용이처럼 과거보다는 지금이 그리고 미래를 생각하게 되는 아티스트는 처음이야 
지나간 시절을 아쉬워하고 성장과 함께 얼굴인상, 체형, 친근했던 성격 그런 것들이 달라지는 걸 상실로 느낀 적이 많은데 
태용이는 정말 달라 
너무너무 풋풋한 어렸을 적 네 모습도 물론 사랑하고 사랑하지만 너는 나날이 연년이 놀랍도록 더 멋있어져가지고 네 과거는 사랑스러움이고 추억이지만 상실은 아니더라고 
태용이는 솔직하고 다 오픈해서 보여주고 그런 너를 보면서 오히려 내가 불안한 적도 있었지만 네 진심과 용기가 옳은 거지 
앞으로도 그렇게 다정하고 다부지게  네 음악과 춤을 네가 사랑하는 것들을 나눠주길 
소중하고 소중한 울태용이 첫 솔로앨범 너무너무 기다리고 있어",5,2023-05-24T03:05:02Z

@fenchortu,"Taeyong is such a bright force. watching him talk about his songs and his creative process in this documentary-like video brought me a wave of serenity traced with anticipation. I like the way he looks at the world, wide-eyed in wonder and with pure honesty. I'm really looking forward to his album, especially the song Ruby, cause its description has already teared me up. also 404 file not found, I just find it fascinating how honest he always seems, genuine and real, while it's probably much easier to hide as much of yourself as you can when you're under constant attention and inspection. And it was sad when he said ""if I wasn't an idol and had a normal life, I'd be so happy and bubbly just strolling in this weather like that."" This is the kind of payoff that is inevitable and longing for it is bittersweet(of course in an ideal world fame wouldn't have to operate that way but this is far from an ideal world).

@lesyuexdesylvia.s,"从之前发在声云的自作曲，到如今马上问世的tolo1，甚至是参与的划曲创作部分，所有作品都给我一种""this is TY's attitude""的感觉，是作词、作曲、编舞都在展现自己态度和内心的artist TY。
tolo并没有太多按照公司给予的标准和要求以及大众期望去制作，而是完完全全在向听众剖析李泰容自我本身，通过每一首歌表达自己的思考和人生哲学。整张专辑其实是李泰容28年来的人生缩影，娓娓讲述了他本人的故事：童年、练习生时期、出道后的阴暗时刻；家人、小狗ruby、朋友……
自己参与作词、作曲、编舞，参与了tolo诞生的全过程，李泰容的作品永远在做自己。SHALALA is an album that belongs entirely to TaeYong.

I truly appreciate Taeyong not only as an artist, but majorly as a human being, it's only thanks to him If today I feel myself so connected to my emotions, because he made me feel a lot of things that I've never imagined to experience, he made me continue to believe in my dreams by always remember me to remain true to myself, even when sometimes the light goes out. He is one of my biggest point of reference and I can tell that with this work he will surely show how grand and pure his soul is.

@biasandbinge,"First thing first, I was watching it with *precise concentration* for some reason. Let me *take a breath* and you guys should also *take a moment to form right words* in your mind to appreciate *the man* who been a *constant pillar* in this legacy that was created. I might end up writing down a whole essay at this moment, but I don't have and would never have the eyes for *so many details* that he has pointed out and seen. It's an overwhelming roller-coaster must be, from beginning to at this point with greatness with flaws (believe me you are perfect TY!!!), but the keen eyes that he has for fragments and stories is worthy of the tale we tell to generation. As if very being, every emotion has taken place in here, the way we got to *visualize without effort* (At one point I was sure that we are going to get 7 M/V for Gods’ sake!!) definitely impressive beyond my words. Think of being a man who just put on sentence and it’s a testament to follow! The way he connect with beings, place, memories (I could never!) is a *clear evidence* that he never lied to what he felt, what he said, what he dreamed. Now that I think of it, few of his *tattoos also bought into words* (I mean how much he meant what he meant so deeply!!!). I am not going to talk about the low-key teaser of every song through instrumental, but I can say they depict *THE LEE TAEYONG* very smoothly sharply verifying the different side he has (God made TY and gave him the key to our hearts!!!). Gotta tell about the photos that been *kxllxng me all the past week* (Dude knows what is style!!!). *To the people behind all the greatness of TY from the journeys’ beginning to until now and to the people who are behind every portion of this album must give my utmost respect to them who made this possible for him.* I was never so very excited for a solo debut in all my life, now that I am here, got to see the creation of something extraordinary, something beautiful and very little something of *THE LEE TAEYONG, the leader of NCT!!!* (Crying in the corner, writing my thought leaving my exam study tomorrow, but it’s worth it!)",0,2023-05-22T16:41:50Z

( Cursos de Inglês e Coreano grátis na internet e em apps, são umas 💩!!!) 

Cool Video, too bad I didn't understand anything, and the most annoying thing about it all is that for me to understand what Taeyong said in the whole video, I have to wait for a Brazilian fan to repost this same mirrored video so I don't get banned, and review this whole video again with subtitles in Portuguese!

@strawberryjamjamie,"브이로그, 셀프 인터뷰 형식으로 곡 소개가 올라온 게 매우 인상적인데, 그만큼 겪어왔던 수많은 일들, 여러 변환점들에서 느꼈던 것들을 대중에게 들려 주면서 누군가와 서로 이해도 하고 공감도 하고 위로도 되려는 그 마음이 샤랄라의 전부같음ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 태용이는 늘 있는 그대로로 나왔는데 그 모습들이 서로 또 다르고 각자 또 매력 있고 멋져서 마음이 이상해요😢 빨리 노래 듣고 무대 보고 싶어!!!",16,2023-05-22T15:27:11Z

@taeoxo_0127,정말 짧은 영상인데 그 안에 긴 기간 동안 열심히 준비했던게 잘 보이고 너무 좋은 마음만 한가득 담아서 주고싶어하는게 잘 느껴져서 더 기대되는 거 같아. 걷기만 해도 멋진 태용이의 샤랄라한 모습 얼른 볼 수 있길 바라. 태용인 항상 너무 잘 하고 있고 네 생각보다도 넌 정말 멋진 사람인거 알아줬으면 좋겠다. 이번주도 잘 보내고 불가능한 일이지만 그래도 늘 행복하고 즐거운일만 생기길 바라. 앞으로도 즐겁게 자주 보자 우리. 사랑해 태용아💕💕💕,13,2023-05-22T15:22:13Z
