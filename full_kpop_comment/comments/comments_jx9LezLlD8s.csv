나에게 너만 있다면
Won't let them break your heart, oh, no
네가 없다면 난 아무것도 아냐
No words are enough for you
노랫말로 담고 싶어

I just want to love you
널 혼자 두지 않아 난
I just want you, I need you

I tell you
This time I wanna rock with you
Moonlight 이 밤에 shine on you
Tonight I wanna ride with you

Baby, hold on, baby, hold on 어디에서도
Baby, hold on, baby, hold on 어디서라도
세상이 끝나더라도
I wanna ride with you
널 위해 달리고 있어
널 위해서라면 뭐든 (뭐든)
숨이 멈출 때까지 난 너만
No words are enough for you
멜로디로 담고 싶어
So 너의 모든 감정 
내가 들을 수 있게 해줘

널 혼자 두지 않아 난
I just want you, I need you
이 밤은 짧고 넌 당연하지 않아

Fall into your eyes
모든 순간들이 오로지 널 향해 있어
나는 너 하나로 충분해
당연한 건 하나 없어
나에게 너만 있어서
Won't let them break your heart, oh no
그 어디라도 baby, hold on, baby, hold on
어디에서도 baby, hold on, baby, hold on

to spot this comment? Finger crossed



제주 귀덕골방에 손님이 신청해주신 음악입니다.

음악은 추억이 아닐까요
누군가에 신청곡으로 첨 듣는 음악을 듣게 되고
어디선가 그음악을 또 듣게 되면
아! 골방에서 들었던 그노래

이런 추억을 다른이에게도 만들어주셨내요

누군가 듣고싶어 신청해주신 이노래를
만들어주신 작사,작곡, 편곡자분들과 불러주신 가수분에게 
정말 감사합니다.


제댓글이 많아 불편하셨다면 정말 죄송합니다.

하지만 제 댓글이 많다는건
이노래를 신청해주신 분들이 많다는거에요

그시간에 신청해주신 분이 이댓글을 보신다면
행복해 하실꺼라는걸 알거든요

그래서 신청곡이 들어올때마다 댓글을 남겨드리고 있어요

그시간에 소중한 신청곡 정말 감사합니다.

골방을 하면서 정말 모르고 있던
좋은 음악들을 많이 듣게되어 행복합니다.

@LaVieEnBlueEsEuphoria,"Not gonna lie they're all good but 

I personally think voices of Wonwoo, Mingyu, Vernon, Soups, and DK perfectly suit this song. Their voices are good for rock music. I want to hear them ( the 5 of them) slay this song (just this song, or they can sing more songs like this) in the future😅😍🤩
😍😍😍


This group screams perfection 🤗

@checa2218,"Contrary to what others said, ALL of them really fit the concept and gave dynamics to the song. It gives you that evocative, haunting and mellow feeling about someone you loved (although I've never fallen in love before LOL). Let me deconstruct how each one of them plays their parts:

SK, DK, WOOZI: extra high notes to express intense emotions like agony, etc.
Hoshi, Dino: mid-range voice to high notes to express the progressive level of emotions
Jun, Minghao,Jeonghan,Jisoo: soft voices to express sadness
S.coups, Wonwoo, Vernon, Mingyu: rough voice to express great desires of wanting someone",83,2022-07-09T02:27:33Z

But...
huft, I woke up unaesthetically you know ( ͡°Ĺ̯ ͡° )
because of something but annoying...
You know? there was a cat outside my house that hit the living room door so hard, until the sound was heard in my room until I woke up forcefully + shocked...
And then..an image of you is gone, even though it's so beautiful even though in that dream I just met you without doing anything...just silent like a stone demon vs a fish because I was nervous xixixixi~ and I couldn't sleep again after that~

지금 이 노래가 내가 될 수 있게
만들어 준 네가 다가온다
셋 둘 하나

뭐든지 다 주고 싶어
나에게 너만 있다면
Won't let them break your heart, oh, no
네가 없다면 난 아무것도 아냐

No words are enough for you
노랫말로 담고 싶어
So, 모든 나의 감정
너로 읽고 쓰게 해줘

I just want to love you
널 혼자 두지 않아 난
I just want you, I need you
이 밤은 짧고 넌 당연하지 않아

I tell you
This time I wanna rock with you
Moonlight 이 밤에 shine on you
Tonight I wanna ride with you
그 어디라도

Baby hold on, baby hold on 어디에서도
Baby hold on, baby hold on 어디서라도
세상이 끝나더라도
I wanna ride with you

널 위해 달리고 있어
널 위해서라면 뭐든 (뭐든)
숨이 멈출 때까지 난 너만

No words are enough for you
멜로디로 담고 싶어
So, 너의 모든 감정
내가 들을 수 있게 해줘

I just want to love you
널 혼자 두지 않아 난
I just want you, I need you
이 밤은 짧고 넌 당연하지 않아

I tell you
This time I wanna rock with you
Moonlight 이 밤에 shine on you
Tonight I wanna ride with you
그 어디라도

Baby hold on, baby hold on 어디에서도
Baby hold on, baby hold on 어디서라도
세상이 끝나더라도
I wanna ride with you
Fall into your eyes
모든 순간들이 오로지 널 향해 있어
나는 너 하나로 충분해

당연한 건 하나 없어
나에게 너만 있어서
Won't let them break your heart, oh no

그 어디라도 baby hold on, baby hold on
어디에서도 baby hold on, baby hold on
어디서라도 세상이 끝나더라도

I wanna rock with you
I wanna rock with you
I wanna stay with you",0,2022-06-14T05:43:29Z

만들어 준 네가 다가온다
셋 둘 하나

뭐든지 다 주고 싶어
나에게 너만 있다면
Won't let them break your heart, oh, no
네가 없다면 난 아무것도 아냐

No words are enough for you
노랫말로 담고 싶어
So, 모든 나의 감정
너로 읽고 쓰게 해줘

I just want to love you
널 혼자 두지 않아 난
I just want you, I need you
이 밤은 짧고 넌 당연하지 않아

I tell you
This time I wanna rock with you
Moonlight 이 밤에 shine on you
Tonight I wanna ride with you
그 어디라도

Baby hold on, baby hold on 어디에서도
Baby hold on, baby hold on 어디서라도
세상이 끝나더라도
I wanna ride with you

널 위해 달리고 있어
널 위해서라면 뭐든 (뭐든)
숨이 멈출 때까지 난 너만

No words are enough for you
멜로디로 담고 싶어
So, 너의 모든 감정
내가 들을 수 있게 해줘

I just want to love you
널 혼자 두지 않아 난
I just want you, I need you
이 밤은 짧고 넌 당연하지 않아

I tell you
This time I wanna rock with you
Moonlight 이 밤에 shine on you
Tonight I wanna ride with you
그 어디라도

Baby hold on, baby hold on 어디에서도
Baby hold on, baby hold on 어디서라도
세상이 끝나더라도
I wanna ride with you
Fall into your eyes
모든 순간들이 오로지 널 향해 있어
나는 너 하나로 충분해

당연한 건 하나 없어
나에게 너만 있어서
Won't let them break your heart, oh no

그 어디라도 baby hold on, baby hold on
어디에서도 baby hold on, baby hold on
어디서라도 세상이 끝나더라도

I wanna rock with you
I wanna stay with you",2,2022-03-22T00:12:47Z

유난히 부드러운 오빠미 뿜뿜하는 승철이
날티를 가득 썼지만 까보면 세상 클린한 하니
지킴 받고 싶게 만드는 지수
눈코입 어디 하나 지지 않고 자기 주장중인 준이
눈썹 스크레치가 세상 빛을 발하는 착장과 얼굴의 호시
저체인 바지가 아니라내 목에 둘러달라는 말이 절로 나오는 원우
예민미와 완벽함이 절절 흘러 넘치는 아름다운 우지
밴드 버전을 제시한 이유가 리얼 타당한 세상 잘 어울리는 명호
스탠딩 마이크 잡고 올블랙으로 흔드는 김민규 어떻게 참아?
앉아서도 끝도없이 올라가는 고음과 측면으로만 봐도 확신의 미모의 도겸이
부남보 굳히기로 작정하고 머리 차분히 내린 남자 부승관

@dinieinsyrah,"지금 이 노래가 내가 될 수 있게
만들어 준 네가 다가온다
셋 둘 하나
뭐든지 다 주고 싶어
나에게 너만 있다면
Won't let them break your heart, oh, no
네가 없다면 난 아무것도 아냐
No words are enough for you
노랫말로 담고 싶어
So, 모든 나의 감정 
너로 읽고 쓰게 해줘
I just want to love you
널 혼자 두지 않아 난
I just want you, I need you
이 밤은 짧고 넌 당연하지 않아
I tell you
This time I wanna rock with you
Moonlight 이 밤에 shine on you
Tonight I wanna ride with you
그 어디라도
Baby hold on, baby hold on 어디에서도
Baby hold on, baby hold on 어디서라도
세상이 끝나더라도
I wanna ride with you
널 위해 달리고 있어
널 위해서라면 뭐든 (뭐든)
숨이 멈출 때까지 난 너만
No words are enough for you
멜로디로 담고 싶어
So, 너의 모든 감정 
내가 들을 수 있게 해줘
I just want to love you
널 혼자 두지 않아 난
I just want you, I need you
이 밤은 짧고 넌 당연하지 않아
I tell you
This time I wanna rock with you
Moonlight 이 밤에 shine on you
Tonight I wanna ride with you
그 어디라도
Baby hold on, baby hold on 어디에서도
Baby hold on, baby hold on 어디서라도
세상이 끝나더라도
I wanna ride with you
Fall into your eyes
모든 순간들이 오로지 널 향해 있어
나는 너 하나로 충분해
당연한 건 하나 없어
나에게 너만 있어서
Won't let them break your heart, oh no
그 어디라도 baby hold on, baby hold on
어디에서도 baby hold on, baby hold on
어디서라도 세상이 끝나더라도
I wanna rock with you
I wanna rock with you
I wanna stay with you

And when they decide to try something different, they still look and sound so flawless, effortless, and natural; no pretensions whatsoever.*
*I, as a Carat, is so proud to see that while SVT is steadily growing in terms of popularity, they're also making sure that they don't stray away from what they would like to sound like and how they would like to portray themselves in the eyes and ears of their audience.*

PLUS JOSHUA WHO STARTS THE SONGS SO POWERFUL AND PRETTY. JEONGHAN'S DELICATE VOICE. WOOZI'S INCREDIBLE HIGH NOTES! ALSO JUN'S FALSETTOS ARE KILLING ME AGAIN. VERNON IMPROVED SO MUCH AND SINGS SO GOOD SAME GOES FOR S.COUPS. MINGYU'S VERSE IS SO GOOD TOO, HE SOUNDS SO BALANCED! HOSHI SANG THE 2ND CHORUS AMAZINGLY. AND SEUNGKWAN AND DK ARE PROVING OMCE AGAIN WHY THEY ARE ONE OF THE BEST VOCALISTS.  I HAVE COMPLIMENTS FOR ALL 13 OF THEM! I KEEP COMING BACK TO THIS LIVE PERFORMANCE...🥲🥲🥲😍😍",1,2021-11-11T00:05:47Z

4. OK whatevers going on between Vernon and Dino, I do not consent at all like why is Vernon holding the mic like that and whyyyy is Dino acting up like maknae line, Che k yourself!! CHECK YOURSELF.
6. LEE JIHOON IS EATING THIS UP!
7. The 8...... Just imagine hos look for call, call, call era with this performance. He is feeling the rock vibes like.... We would be dead with such a situation.

@fatima21minguggie,"지금 이 노래가 내가 될 수 있게
만들어 준 네가 다가온다 (셋, 둘, 하나)

뭐든지 다 주고 싶어
나에게 너만 있다면
Won't let them break your heart, oh no
네가 없다면 난 아무것도 아냐
No words are enough for you
노랫말로 담고 싶어
So 모든 나의 감정 너로 읽고 쓰게 해줘

I just want to love you
널 혼자 두지 않아 난
I just want you, I need you
이 밤은 짧고 넌 당연하지 않아

I tell you, this time, I wanna rock with you
Moonlight, 이 밤에 shine on you
Tonight, I wanna ride with you
그 어디라도

Baby, hold on, baby, hold on (어디에서도)
Baby, hold on, baby, hold on (어디서라도)
세상이 끝나더라도
I wanna ride with you

널 위해 달리고 있어
널 위해서라면 뭐든
숨이 멈출 때까지 난 너만
No words are enough for you
멜로디로 담고 싶어
So 너의 모든 감정 내가 들을 수 있게 해줘

I just want to love you
널 혼자 두지 않아 난
I just want you, I need you
이 밤은 짧고 넌 당연하지 않아

I tell you, this time, I wanna rock with you
Moonlight, 이 밤에 shine on you
Tonight, I wanna ride with you
그 어디라도

Baby, hold on, baby, hold on (어디에서도)
Baby, hold on, baby, hold on (어디서라도)
세상이 끝나더라도

I wanna ride with you, fall into your eyes
모든 순간들이 오로지 널 향해 있어
나는 너 하나로 충분해
당연한 건 하나 없어
나에게 너만 있어서
Won't let them break your heart, oh no

그 어디라도
Baby, hold on, baby, hold on (어디에서도)
Baby, hold on, baby, hold on (어디서라도)
세상이 끝나더라도

I wanna rock with you
I wanna rock with you
I wanna stay with you",1,2021-11-07T17:01:45Z

@louishenderson7474,"jadi lagu ini bisa jadi aku sekarang
Anda yang membuatnya datang kepada saya (tiga, dua, satu)
Aku ingin memberimu selamanya
jika aku hanya memilikimu
Tidak akan membiarkan mereka menghancurkan hatimu (oh tidak)
Tanpamu aku bukan apa-apa
Tidak ada kata yang cukup untukmu
Saya ingin memasukkanya ke dalam lirik
Jadi semua perasaanku membiarkanku membaca dan menulis
aku hanya ingin mencintaimu
Aku tidak akan meninggalkanmu sendirian
Aku hanya menginginkanmu, aku membutuhkanmu
Malam ini singkat dan Anda tidak menerima begitu saja
Saya katakan, kali ini, saya ingin rock dengan Anda
Cahaya bulan, menyinarimu di malam ini
Malam ini, aku ingin berkendara denganmu
dimana saja
Sayang, tunggu, sayang, tunggu (di mana saja)
Sayang, tunggu, sayang, tunggu (di mana saja)
bahkan jika dunia berakhir
Aku ingin berkendara denganmu
berlari untukmu
apapun untukmu
Sampai aku berhenti bernafas, aku hanya memilikimu
Tidak ada kata yang cukup untukmu
Saya ingin memasukkannya ke dalam melodi
Jadi biarkan aku mendengar semua perasaanmu
aku hanya ingin mencintaimu
Aku tidak akan meninggalkanmu sendirian
Aku hanya menginginkanmu, aku membutuhkanmu
Malam ini singkat dan Anda tidak menerima begitu saja
Saya katakan, kali ini, saya akan rock dengan Anda
Cahaya bulan, menyinarimu di malam ini
Malam ini, aku ingin berkendara denganmu
dimana saja
Sayang, tunggu, sayang tunggu (di mana saja)
Sayang, tunggu, sayang tunggu (di mana saja)
bahkan jika dunia berakhir
Aku ingin naik bersamamu, jatuh ke matamu
Semua momen hanya untukmu
Aku cukup denganmu
tidak ada yang jelas
aku hanya memilikimu
Tidak akan membiarkan mereka menghancurkan hatimu, oh tidak
dimana saja
Sayang, tunggu, sayang, tunggu (di mana saja)
Sayang, tunggu, sayang, tunggu (di mana saja)
bahkan jika dunia berakhir
Aku ingin bergoyang denganmu
Aku ingin bergoyang denganmu
aku ingin bersamamu",2,2021-11-07T05:46:06Z

@visual_gray,"I've been listening to quite a few band versions of kpop songs and nearly every single one of them... I felt that were kinda off, not really matching the original sound of the song but for this one whoa, it's just so good! It really get with the original song, idk if it's cuz the original inst has a lot of the same instruments complements but really this version can work as the original song by itself bringing more that rock vibe, I just love this version, personally is so my style that feels so refreshing by hearing it in between all the other kpop songs that are out right now (they´re good too, it's jut my personal opinion)   (Edit) Okay, so I was just so inmersed while listening to RWY that I started analyzing the inst and I noticed how well constructed it is, Jihoon and his team did a marvelous job with the song, as well as the musicians here, idk who made the arrangement BUT did an amazing job, the musical construction is so fine and I'm in love with it, but I'll stop here or I'll just star telling everything I love about the inst lol",12,2021-11-06T18:40:31Z

if they are not a boy group they can make a good boy band imagine Hiphop
 Unit for bass, rap, flat lines. Vocal unit for high notes and belting 
(DK and Seungkwan). Performance unit for falsetto and baritone.

@MK-rm6uz,"*가사*

지금 이 노래가 내가 될 수 있게
만들어 준 네가 다가온다
셋 둘 하나

뭐든지 다 주고 싶어
나에게 너만 있다면
Won’t let them break your heart oh no
네가 없다면 난 아무것도 아냐

No words are enough for you
노랫말로 담고 싶어
So, 모든 나의 감정 
너로 읽고 쓰게 해줘

I just want to love you
널 혼자 두지 않아 난
I just want you, I need you
이 밤은 짧고 넌 당연하지 않아

I tell you
This time I wanna rock with you
Moonlight 이 밤에 Shine on you
Tonight I wanna ride with you
그 어디라도

Baby hold on Baby hold on
어디에서도
Baby hold on Baby hold on
어디서라도
세상이 끝나더라도
I wanna ride with you

널 위해 달리고 있어
널 위해서라면 뭐든
숨이 멈출 때까지 난 너만

No words are enough for you
멜로디로 담고 싶어
So, 너의 모든 감정 
내가 들을 수 있게 해줘

I just want to love you
널 혼자 두지 않아 난
I just want you, I need you
이 밤은 짧고 넌 당연하지 않아

I tell you
This time I wanna rock with you
Moonlight 이 밤에 Shine on you
Tonight I wanna ride with you
그 어디라도

Baby hold on Baby hold on
어디에서도
Baby hold on Baby hold on
어디서라도
세상이 끝나더라도
I wanna

Ride with you
Fall into your eyes
모든 순간들이 오로지 널 향해 있어
나는 너 하나로 충분해

당연한 건 하나 없어
나에게 너만 있어서
Won’t let them break your heart oh no

그 어디라도
Baby hold on Baby hold on
어디에서도
Baby hold on Baby hold on
어디서라도
세상이 끝나더라도

I wanna rock with you
I wanna rock with you
I wanna stay with you",1,2021-11-03T06:03:57Z

@casperrecord6985,"Scoups is indeed a rock star~ how his voice blends so well with the bass, he’s a rapper yet he has such a powerful ROCK VIBE which is so rare in seventeen, don’t get me wrong, everyone in seventeen is unique in their own ways but MR CHOI SEUNGCHEOL IS THE ROCK SINGER IN SEVENTEEN AND HE SIMPLY BE IT UNAPOLOGETICALLY though seventeen tends to be SOFT in term of vocal. He is CHOI SEUNGCHEOL our FAITHFUL AND LOVING LEADER. I’m so proud to be his fan, carat and WELCOME BACK MYUNGHO AND JUNNIE, we miss you so much!!!!! 💕 💎❤️✨👌

@markcouture4726,"Lots of cheating in this ""live"" performance. I mean, there's all kinds of backing vocals that are coming from nowhere. Backing track. Many of these guys sound really nasal and pinched, almost whiney. and it's not just because of the falsetto. Falsetto doesn't need to sound like that, but the natural voices are like that, too. The guy next to Woozi (I forgot his name) is a great vocalist but even he's a bit nasal. Woozi's got such a great instrument but he does that pinched sound and it's really disappointing. The two guys in the middle in the back also sound great. (Is that Wonwoo and DK?) Nice open sounds. Vernon and the other rapper on the right end in the back have nice open sounds, too, even if they aren't considered by fans as the best vocalists, but they actually sound better than half the other guys here. They should be featured more.",0,2021-11-01T19:51:26Z

@rendeypalubos,"The most amazing thing about this group is having 13 totally multi-talented members with diverse personalities and they make such a rare and powerful combination resulting to all these top-tier performances and songs that reach a whole new level of musicality.

With 13 members giving a rich and flavorful variation in the voices, every performance is a sure knockout - not to mention, the level of sophistication and choreography that leaves you breathless. Every song and number is a monument of their dedication and hard work for their fans, us CARATS.

@yuu_megumi,"Whoah, I can barely describe how much I loved this! The instrumental is insane, the guitar and the whole band concept fit the vibe of the song so hard! Also, the members' voice are so clear and absolutely pleasuring to hear: the passion, the technique, everything! Furthermore, although the outfits are rather simple, the visuals are stunning. 
P.S.: the next remark might be biased but I personally think Vernon was made for this! I nearly freaked out watching the way he rapped/sang and performed here, his expression on point and hypnotizing. Also, shout-out to Joshua and Woozi, who I couldn't take my eyes off and for some reason fit this concept so well.",0,2021-11-01T16:44:05Z

@nnaacc217,이번 앨범은 부득이하게 두 멤버는 멀리 가게 되어 함께 활동하지 못했고 시국이 시국인지라 팬들과는 2년째 만나지 못하고 있는 상황에서 나온 앨범임 그리고 그 앨범은 power of love 즉 사랑의 힘을 보여주는 프로젝트의 두번째 앨범임 그렇게 멤버의 부재와 팬들과 직접적 만남이 불가한 현실에서 오히려 사랑의 힘을 더 잘 보여주는 앨범과 활동이 되었음 빡빡한 일정으로 활동하면서 앨범을 준비하고 개인 활동도 많았고. 그런데 그 바쁜 스케줄에서도 음악에 대한 사랑으로 흠없는 무대를 만들었음 모든 무대와 영상들이 다 완벽했고 즐기는게 보임 옷만 갈아입는게 아니라 새로 연습해야 하는 영상들을 꾸준히 올려주고 세븐틴을 사랑하는 마음으로 세븐틴을 알리기 위해 예능에 엄청 나가 세븐틴에 대한 사랑을 표현함 그리고 두 멤버는 가기전에 엄청난 양의 스케줄을 미리 소화하고 떠남 멤버가 부재함에도 그걸 채우기 위해 최선을 다했고 스태프분들은 밑에서 크게 응원법을 외쳐주셨음 중국으로 간 멤버들한텐 내가 니 파트 불렀다 잘불렀다! 하며 서로가 서로의 빈자리를 채우기 위해 최선을 다했음 중국에서 스케줄하는 멤버들은 세븐틴의 신곡 챌린지를 하고 꾸준히 사진을 올리며 팬들과 소통해 부재를 느끼지 못하게 노력하고 있음 따로 떨어져 있어도 세븐틴식 인사를 하고 한국에 있는 멤버들은 늘 완전체가 아니라 아쉬워하며 다음에는 13명 전부를 꼭 약속함 매일 연락하며 안부를 묻고 보고 싶다하면 바로 영상통화하고 첫 주연작에 모두가 밀다발(중국에서 성공의 상징)과 편지를 보내주고 받은 멤버는 하나하나 읽고 다 기억하며 사진으로 고마움을 표현함 뮤비 리액셕을 하며 한 말은 이렇게 보니 멤버들이 더 보고 싶다 였음 사랑의 힘은 떨어져 있어도 약해지거나 끊어지지 않는거란걸 온 몸으로 표현해줌 무대에서도 그리고 무대 밑에서도. 열정적이고 진실되고 사랑하기에 당연하지 않음을 않고 그래서 현재에 최선을 다하고 그 모든게 그들의 사랑이고 사랑의 방식임을 인터넷으로만 볼 수 있는 팬들조차 느낌 사랑은 이런거였음,0,2021-11-01T16:06:38Z

정한-탈색머리에 옷 스타일까지 갓벽해서 인기 겁나 많은 보컬
지수-통기타로 썬데이모닝 불러주는 감성 보컬&기타리스트
준휘-자신만의 스타일로 연주하는 장난끼많은 서브보컬&어쿠스틱 베이스
순영-스크래치에 짧머까지 날티나는 일렉기타리스트&서브보컬&공동차장
원우-동굴저음으로 사람홀리고 근육팔로 드럼 부시는 드러머&래퍼
지훈-섬섬옥수로 피아노 연주하는 피아니스트&리드보컬&공동차장
명호-명상에 방해된다며 일렉 대신 어쿠스틱 기타를 연주하는 기타리스트&서브보컬
민규-일렉기타치면서 가끔보이는 팔근육 도라방스 기타리스트&래퍼
석민-하이톤의 청량한 목소리로 지붕뚫고 하이킥 찍어버리는 락밴드 메인보컬
승관-감정에 호소하면서 애원하듯이 애절하게 부르는 감성 메인보컬
한솔-무뚝뚝한 저음으로 사람 설레게하는 일렉 베이스&래퍼

@nnaacc217,더 성숙하고 멋있어졌지만 갑자기 어른이 되고 남자가 되고 그런게 아닌 그동안 쌓아온 앨범과 활동들 그 위에서 그 모든것들을 보여주면서 동시에 이만큼 자랐습니다 하니까 그 성장에 서사가 있고 개연성이 있음 노래는 신나고 벅차고 흔히 말하는 90년대생들이 좋아하는 투니버스 리즈시절 오슷이랑 비슷하게 락사운드인데 비단 만화 뿐만 아니라 그런 어린시절 부터 지금까지의 모든 경험들을 녹여낸 어른스러움이 그들의 성장을 더 자연스럽게 여기게 해줌 모든 앨범도 당연히 세븐틴이 쓰는 만큼 세븐틴스럽지만 커버를 하든 편곡을 하든 뭘해도 다 세븐틴이 녹아있다는게 정말 자랑스럽고 그래서 이 영상이 소중하다 소년만화 주인공 같은 세븐틴이 그 오프닝을 열어도 될만큼 멋있는 모습을 활동이 끝나고도 계속 보여주는게 고맙고 소중함 세븐틴이란 영화와 만화의 주인공들이 오프닝도 이야기도 엔딩도 온전히 자기들이 쓰고 자기들의 목소리로 노래해줘서 좋고 앞으로도 계속 지금처럼 함께 춤추고 노래하자 우리가 빛내줄게,0,2021-11-01T15:39:21Z

@vindicatedtruth,"Best thing I'm loving about this comeback is that SEVENTEEN is ultimately proving two things:

1) That they don't really have a ""signature sound"" because they can take on ANY concept or genre—like this true rock and roll version—because that's how versatile their talent is, and what they inject in all the genres they explore is their effervescent joy and passion in everything they do, and

2) That they are legit true vocalists IN ADDITION TO being legit dancers. The vocals they've been flexing not just on Rock With You, but the whole Attacca album, is them reminding the industry that they're a threat not only as outstanding performers, but irrevocably talented vocalists, too 🔥",98,2021-11-01T15:24:57Z

But what I want to remind us all is that let us all be humble and defend SVT in a smart and proper way. Because in some ways how we act reflect on SVT, we don’t want to be “toxic”.

My boys must have been so busy preparing all of this before MH and Jun went to China, and they (the rest of the boys) just make sure to keep bringing up their names so everyone know they're 13 members even when two of them are apart for other activities. 

Plus, this is exactly how i imagine RWY performance during a concert, it fits them so well. Their vocals slay and the arrangements with the instruments are crazy good.

[Personalization] 
TO CARATS:

You all made who we are now 
We want to give you everything 
Without you, we are nothing

No words are enough to express our feelings for all of you…
We want to right it lyrical, 
We want to keep it melodical
So let me read and write my emotions through you
We will also listen to all your emotions

We just want to love you
We won't leave you alone
Together, our time is short,  so we will not take it for granted. 

Every moment is pointing to you
All we ever need is you
Take nothing for granted you're all we got
We will not break your heart 

Where ever we are, wherever we go
We wanna ride with you

Carats hold on, even if the world is ending we're still gonna sing for all of you ( I wanna rock with you) 
We want to stay with you 💘😭😭",2,2021-11-01T15:01:16Z

@KRIS_LUNA11,"No matter what opinion, SEVENTEENare full OF passion AND they ALWAYS give THEIR Best. I bet any audience can feel their powerful energy On STAGE but also when SINGING AND that si something that goes beyond languaje barrier AND understanding. That is a pure form OF art, pure form expression AND I support that they not afraid to feel THE SONG AND that only MAKES THE viewer / listener closet to FEELING THE whole vibe BETTER to themselves.💜",1291,2021-11-01T15:00:29Z
