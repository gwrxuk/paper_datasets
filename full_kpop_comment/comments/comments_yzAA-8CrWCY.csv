Yeah yeah
I don’t know
somethin’ about you babe
The way you make me feel
It’s surreal, forreal tho

I see you when I sleep at night
뒤바뀐 낮과 밤
You know I dream you right

눈을 비비던 너와 들었던 음악
Old School “Sho’ You Right”

붉어진 유리컵
검은 머리끈
빨라지는 Rhythm shh

I can’t get you out of my
(Can’t get you out of)
out of my
(Can’t get you out of)
out of my system
I can’t get you out of my
(Can’t get you out of)

(Can’t get you out of my)
I know you know
(Out of my)
I know you know
I know you know
I know you know

더는 감춰지지 않는

Beat of your heart
크게 Breathe in my arms
I feel you, feel me?

uh huh
oh yeah
헤매이던 끝에 In your space

(ooh girl)
Girl, 붉어진 유리컵
검은 머리끈
빨라지는 Rhythm

I can’t get you out of my
