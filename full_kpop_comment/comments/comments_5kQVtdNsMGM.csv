@timothxl,Mark는 진짜 천재다 ... 이 노래를 통해 사춘기의 방황함과 불완전함을 완전히 느낄 수 있다는 것이 이 노래의 완전함을 증명해주는 것 같다. 보컬을 내뱉을 때는 사춘기의 불안함이 묻어나는 부드러움이지만 랩을 할땐 강함이 드러나는 게 너무나 대단하고 랩과 보컬을 둘 다 완벽히 소화하는 마크를 보고 있으면 머지않아 얼마나 더 큰 솔리스트가 되어있을까 가늠할 수도 없다 .. Mark 좋은 노래 남겨줘서 고맙고 네가 원하는 것을 하나하나 이루어 갔으면 좋겠다. 마크 솔로콘서트가 열리는 그날을 기다리며 ...,2,2023-06-05T14:47:24Z

@user-sm6fl3ob6z,"뭔가 이 영상에서 좀 더 반항심 있게 부르는 것 같아서 너무 좋다 이 음악 진짜 몇 번을 들어도 마크의 마음과 심리적인 부분들이 너무 잘 드러나있는 것처럼 느껴져서 좋다
사춘기를 10대 후반에 겪었다는 얘기를 자기 입으로 직접 말하는 마크 보고 울컥했어요 진짜 우리 시즈니분들도 진짜 고생 많으셨고 하지만 우리에 비해 훨씬 더 많이 고생한 건 언제나 멤버들이고, 스테프분들이겠지 진짜 너무나도 큰 선물을 받은 것 같고 자기전마다 하루를 끝내기 전에 나를 돌아보기 위해 듣는 노래가 되어버렸다 정말 세상에 어른은 없고 우리 모두다 같은 고민을 하면서 같은 방법으로 스트레스를 풀어가고 같은 이유 때문에 행복하고 또는 슬프고 또는 화나거나 불안하고 긴장하기도 하지 어른과 어린이를 단어와 나이만으로 구분짓기는 너무 어른스러운 아이들도 많고 또는 너무 아이같은 어른들도 많다
그러니 우린 모두 아이일 뿐이야
이 글을 보는 당신들은 아이이기 때문에 누구한테든 투정부려도 되고, 아니면 그 투정을 받아줄 수도 있고, 스트레스 받는게 당연하고 불안정한게 당연해요 너무 스트레스를 받으면 안 좋은 방법들 빼고 모든 방법들을 총동원 해서 스트레스를 푸는데에 시간을 투자하세요 우린 딱 한 번 사는거고 1시간 1분 1초 결국은 지나가면 끝이에요 그러니 후회없이 행동하고 음... 그냥 전하고싶은 말은 나이로도 그렇고 단어로도 그렇고? 어른이라는 무게때문에 부담감 느낄 필요 없고 Child 가사 그대로 서두르려다 서툴러질 뿐이에요 서두리지 마세요 우린 지금을 즐기면 된다! 제발 세상 모든 사람들이 혼자 힘들어하지 않고 혼자 감당하지 않았으면 좋겠네요 다들 지금까지 정말 수고하셨습니다 이 글을 읽은 이후로는 우리 다들 더 열심히 살아요! 우리 다 너무 멋진 사람들이라는 거 알았으면 좋겠어요
그리고 마크야 이미 많은 팬분들, 동료들, 가족들에게 많이 들은 말들이겠지만 항상 한결같은 모습으로 언제 어디서든 ’열심히‘의 표본같은 모습들을 보여줘서 고마워 쉴새없는 스케줄들에 너가 많이 걱정도 되지만, 그만큼 자기관리도 철저하게 하는 너를 보면 정말 대단하면서도 덜 걱정하게 해주는 것 같아서 진짜 자랑스럽고 고맙다 2023도 NCT가 간다! 쩔어주자 화이팅! 이걸 보는 시즈니들도 2023 스트레스 받지 않고 걱정없이 항상 건강하게 보내요! 화이팅 2023💚💚",19,2023-03-25T11:55:24Z

It's reminiscent of one's younger years and when times were simpler. As we grow up and are adults, we constantly encounter difficulties and questions. It'd be nice to be a child again, to not have those responsibilities and be ignorant of the world around us. But even as adults we are still ignorant of things and want to live like a child. Overall, his voice and the music are very compatible. The melodic rap and singing was well delivered and I love how we can feel a sense of lost, desperateness, and desire.",0,2022-11-09T03:01:03Z

@Tyanes17,"It's ironic that the song is called ""Child"" when Mark feels so mature as a young man and artist. And the sound and the lyrics themselves feel mature. Only a mature person would see itself as a child. If that makes sense hahahaha It takes maturity to understand one's own vulnerability",1,2022-09-26T23:19:20Z
@j-ar5002,"There’s something about Mark that’s very… homey. Idk how to express it. But he seems like someone you’d want to be friends with. The way he express himself, you’ll feel comfortable with him immediately. He has that presence that you will connect without feeling  iffy.

@karla-cy7mr,"i come back to this video at least once a month bc i love the live version of this song. it never fails to cheer me up and i just love hearing about his process and what he was thinking while making this beautiful song. i feel like sometimes mark is overlooked and not taken seriously just bc of how goofy and silly he can be, which i love him for it don’t get me wrong, he never fails to make me laugh. But i just wish that more people could this side of him as well, that people could see how big his passion for music is. im hoping that in the future, as he drops more of his own music and shows us different sides of him, that more people will respect him and praise him like we do. thank you mark lee for being you and giving us this gift of a song 🫶🏻",0,2022-09-17T04:26:55Z

I’m very proud and happy that Mark came out with this song. I’d like to see more of this side of Mark more.

I love idol Mark but musically, really looking forward to the next phase of his career.

@Its_se2,"The ""Need to blow up now"" is so honest...everything about Mark is and was so fast...Mark blew up when he was only 16 and he's living his dream at 22/23 and i think this song really showcases how...complex Mark's mind and inner world is. He's so young but has achieved so much. An inspiration. An Icon. Mark Lee you are the moment. The idol who represents our inner voice. 💚

Child is a song that takes you back to your hardest times...one that showcases Mark's hard work and one that reminds you that it's ok...you don't need to grow up so quickly...you're a CHILD...just work hard and enjoy your youth. Somehow I feel like Mark is yelling at me for allowing myself to be forced to ""grow up now""💚

Thank you Mark for giving us something to relate to. Thank you for always working hard for us. Thank you for always trying to connect with us.💚💚💚💚",0,2022-04-07T18:45:59Z

@ro.jenn1,"to be honest I am so grateful for this gift, it was out on February 4th as mark said it is a gift to us but for me it’s was a birthday present from mark, a week before “child” was released I tried so hard to find a special song that I can always relate with and forget about all the things that I’ve been though with an uncle and how much he has put me through that it got to the point that I’m traumatized and scared of him and I’ve been stressed out with school and grades and I always wish there was a song that I can listen to whenever I’m sad and alone and I did it’s “child”. I have been though a lot of stuff that I wish I’ve never been though and that I wish nobody will ever go through it ether. mark is such a blessing in my life, he is the person of comfort and him saying that it’s going to be okay I feel so safe.

@sh1r_c0hen,"I have so much to say, for real
Im thankful and happy and proud and excited and sad, and hurt and so many things…
I learned in this video more about mark and im happy and thankful for that. Im happy he was given his beautiful personality and this huge opportunity and skills and friends and family and fans and people who support him and love him and help him. Im ofc sad he went through so many pain that i cant even know but i do feel… but this amazing child makes me feel so relaxed about his difficulties of life bcs i see how beautifully he takes everything and how an appreciating person he is and how crazy this masterpiece “child” came out. Im so happy he could understand and express and experience himself through music, through the mv itself, trough the clothes he put on and just everything. His words, his voice, everything has a very heavy meaning and im just thankful for that. With all the pain and happiness i feel, im just thankful for his journey, for his opportunities, for his decisions and way of life. He is much more than a good person or an amazing artist, dancer, rapper, performer whatever, he is a really really huge gift to our world. He is someone we all have to learn from him and im so happy and shocked and thankful for having this huge opportunity to be able to actually learn from him in so many ways, so many things. And all of it when im far away from him. Im really happy and jealous of the people who are close to him, around him, im also super duper happy for myself to be able to know him and to get so many options to watch him and his way of life and thoughts and feelings and actions, i really hope to get more, as long as he feels comfortable and okay with that. I hope this guy will forever be happy and relaxed and healthy and PROUD of himself and thankful for who he is, cause i am, and even if i wasnt, he must know himself.
Thanks for everyone who made his life happier. For real.
And thank u johnny for being there to comfort him in this beautiful interview.

@AS-yx3zc,"Mark, a lot of the times one isn't able to see what others can, you might doubt if parts of the song actually have your vibe or not, but let me tell you, even though we don't personally know you, we've seen you grow up and face the opportunities as they come, through snippets and interviews we've gotten glimpses of you and how your mind works, and I can't help but feel overwhelmed at how every single second of the song and every single word of the lyrics are so *you* . You touched my heart with Child. All the feelings I can't articulate to people around me, you blossomed them into life. When I listen to Child, it's like we are interacting, it feels like you're just there sitting in my room empathising with me. There's an indescribable amount of comfort in knowing that for a moment, both of us can understand each other. 
Your sincerity is tangible Mark. The way I find solace in the thought that you wanted to do this specifically for us, I hope you also find solace in the thought that we are specifically there for you too, if sometimes you falter and doubt yourself, we will still see you for who you are. And love and support you for who you are. Who are you? You're Mark. Who you'll be? You'll be Mark. You might have many concerns about the past and the future, but I hope you find more things that bring you joy, joy that will overpower your concerns. Many things have and will change in your life, but we will always be by your side from afar. We got you Mark, we got your back.",10,2022-02-15T20:42:40Z

From writing the lyrics, creating different versions of the song, helping pick the title, having a vision for the music video, giving feedback throughout the music video editing process and even to picking the outfits. He was born to create music. Also his live stage always beats the original in my opinion, his voice is so stable. All I'm saying Mark's so talented, SM truly hit the jackpot with him. No matter how busy his schedule is trying to balancing 4 different groups, he always give 100% into every single group comeback. But even with his packed schedule, he always makes time to create music just because he loves it that much. That's the pure definition of an artist to me",1014,2022-02-14T07:54:28Z

Makasih udah bertahan sejauh ini dan berhasil sedikit demi sedikit lewatin struggle yang lo alamin selama ini. makasih sudah berhasil tumbuh menjadi the best personality of mark. Gue juga lagi berjuang lawan struggle di hidup gue. Dan lagu ini hadir sebagai karya yang gue anggep sebagai masterpiece, yang bikin gue inget, bahwa gak cuma ada gue ternyata yang struggle, bahkan lo yang setaraf artis tingkat dunia aja sama mengalami masa kaya gue. Dan ini membuat gue gak merasa sendirian. Terimakasih banyak mark, lo udah hadir sebagai teman seperjuangan gue, even lo gak tau gue hidup atau ngga.

Mark. That's it, Mark, I can't say any more words, I just want to say... Thank you for sticking around so far and getting through the struggles you've been through all this time little by little. Thank you for growing to be the best personality of mark. I'm also struggling with the struggles in my life. I'm also struggling with the struggle in my life. And this song is present as a work that I consider a masterpiece, what makes me remember, that I'm not the only one who struggles,  Even those of you who are on par with world-class artists have experienced the same period as me.And this makes me not feel alone.

Thank you for letting us get to you on a deeper level and share with us a piece of your mind, CHILD is really an amazing song. You inspire me every day to be a better version of myself, to work hard, and always give 110% on everything. I'll be here to see your growth as a solo artist and I know you'll go places with your writing, singing, rapping. I'm so proud of you, kid.

@diana-hx3qz,"Anyone else emotional watching this? I really love how Mark was honest about the process of making his song. It truly does fit him, but I like that he still considered other options & put careful thought into it. I just hope Mark is proud of himself and his work! I love how Johnny was also here to cheer Mark on and be that pillar of support, you know? Mark seemed to appreciate his presence & it felt like he was grateful to have such a friend interviewing him on something that of course is regarded as more personal and another step towards Mark's artistry. And speaking of which, I felt like I was witnessing something larger than just an interview, as cheesey as that may sound. I don't know, with how amazing Mark is, I felt like I was documentary or something showing one of the biggest artists and their performance from years back, reflecting and honoring just how much of an important time it was for Mark to have a slice of a solo career before he truly takes flight. I had goosebumps towards the end. It's just truly something special. We love you Mark.",341,2022-02-12T22:27:14Z

@kagurachan1763,📍 Mark originally had no plans to incorporate the singing aspect … I’m so happy he was urged to incorporate more singing despite it not being in his initial vision . Mark singing is very minimal in the songs he performs in. If he is it’s mixed in with everyone else’s voices so it gets lost. Who would have known Mark has such gentle vocals that deserve as much love and support as his rapping. Seeing that the song got such positive feedback overall I hope Mark is given more opportunities to explore his talents outside of his comfort zone . He’s grown so much as an artist but I feel now he can grow in ways he wouldn’t other wise have imagined 👏,0,2022-02-12T19:51:14Z

I got soo many people around me who love me yet I always feel like the most loneliest person ever.. But it's fine because I'm still young so maybe I'll stop feeling like this when I grow up.

Im really happy to be able to hear Mark talking about Dress and how it was working with him, he is one of my favorite producers (top 5 at least), and Mark is my nct bias and the song sounds so good and Mark's lyrics were so good and this is… yeah, it's a lot.

@petrakonecnaportaits,"When I listened to the song for the first time I thought it's a really nice song, but to be honest it wasn't what I expected from Mark, but after reading the lyrics and listening to the song few times I really grew to like it a lot. Mark is a really precious person to me, I think of him as a really kind and talented person. He's definitely one of the artists that I'm really looking forward to hear his music from. I really love his raping and I'm not even that much of a fan of rap as I don't listen to rap much. I already know Mark is a great singer from hearing him sing on IG live. I'm a bit concerned about what he said in this video though, I think he's very creative and original in his music and his ideas so I would like them to let him be more him in his music. I would like for them to let him do what he wants in his music (even naming the songs). I really hope they won't push him to sing if he doesn't want it much in his music if he wants to rap much more, or that they won't push him to make music that doesn't feel like him. Anyway I think he did a great job with the song and the MV is awesome as well. Mark did such an amazing job with the performance, he sang and rapped really well, but I think it's clear that rap is very natural for him and it seems that he wants to rap more than sing. I also prefer this verson than the original. Thank you for the video as we got to know his thoughts.",26,2022-02-12T07:44:07Z

The second time you hear it the lyrics has becoming an impact and a comfort to my own personal questions.

@anaroseluda515,"Ive been listening to Child and I'm spacing out sometimes, thinking how life was so hard and reminiscing my childhood, how I enjoyed life as a child just doing everything and nothing to worry about. Esp the lyrics ""It’s my question many questions Who am I in others’ eyes Who am I who I’ll be..."" this made me worried about life as I am getting older,  bcs the older you get the more you feel anxious in everything . "" Would there be anyone who can relate Can someone understand me just for now..."" the unfairness I get in everything.

@김가현-h6v,"너가 뭔데 내 마음을
매달고 흔들어 날 어지럽게
내가 문제아라면 왜
항상 질문을 던지는 건데
Oh I Oh I Oh I 서두르다가
Oh I Oh I Oh I 서툴러지네
I'm a child
너가 바란대론 못 돼
Have a good night
자장가는 필요 없대
It's my question many questions
사람들이 바라본 난 누구야
Who am I who I'll be
다른 밤 같은 Nightmare
Why why why kill my night
너가 부숴버린 밤에
내가 다칠 것 같아
Blah blah blah y'all talk too much
Don't waste my time
거기까지만 해
I pull at the strings when I'm pissed
알 사람들만 알지 난 좀
Twisted but the fittest to the point
꿈이라는 게 태양이라면
내 머리는 그걸
빙빙 도는 Earth all day
I'm alert it's a curse yeah it hurts
I don't know my own strength
There's a lot that I don't know
But you learn when you don't know
Red on my Valentino
부숴도 부술래 내 책임감
자유로울 때까지 뒤를 안 돌아봐
꼭 먼 남이 되고 싶었어 이 사회와
Propane이 부러워
I need to blow up now
투박해야 느껴지나 봐 이 맛
가시를 길러 쉽게 못 넘기게 날
How'd I get so bitter
Brother liquor
I don't feel the same
넌 어때 Tell me later
I'm a child
너가 바란대론 못 돼
Have a good night
자장가는 필요 없대
It's my question many questions
사람들이 바라본 난 누구야
Who am I who I'll be

지금만큼은 알아주면 안될까

@cinnamon0817,"When you listened to this song, you felt the depth and soul of it..  The music, the message, the soul that resonates to your heart. It is not only for those Child who can relate to it, but also us, as adults.. the questions of identity within ourselves, with the people we loved and the society. Liked what Sir Mark Lee said, it is a gift for his fans, and yes indeed it was truly a gift. A gift of music that feeds the soul. 😍",4,2022-02-12T04:13:52Z

But even though Mark sang a song called child, he's a MAN in this performance.  His eyes and body language, his soothing, smooth vocals.  I was locked.  And I love this song.  If I was a moody teenager I'd lie in bed, at 3am repeating this song over and over with my Mark Lee poster over my bed.  I heard once that someone called Mark a Kpop prodigy.  Truth.  He can do everything and anything.",1,2022-02-12T04:00:49Z

@talialeon9,"For me ""Child"" was a song for those who had to grow up and couldn't live their childhood as a proper kid. The expectation of being a ""grown up"" while being still a child and having all these people surrounding you expecting you to be a certain way or wanting you to do all these things when you're just a kid. The pressure of having the whole world on top of your shoulders, yet, you're still a child trying to learn without any guidance and being stuck in a body of a child while being a responsible ""grown up"" when you're not even an adult yet. I felt that to the core because I couldn't be a kid properly and had to grow up so fast and had all these questions and felt so lost so many times. So, I was quite moved and so incredibly proud of Mark. His artistry is just out of this galaxy! Thank you Mark for showcasing this vulnerable and new side of you ♡",596,2022-02-12T03:10:41Z

I think you are the most genuine, hardworking and sweet person ever. This song made me think you bare a lot of weight on your shoulders and we know It's not easy to be a singer, especially in Korea at this time, but It's your dream and to achieve It you went all the way, maybe sacrificing a bit of your youth too. That's brave and if It's what your soul truly wants, you are so so courageous.  I hope, I really hope this path that you chose really makes you so so so happy and fullfilled. You are a pure soul and we can all see that, just take care of yourself and also please rest. I just wish you would feel free from the weight of your responsabilities at least sometimes.
Love you a lot, Mark. Be Happy  ❤️

@dreamreality127,"Its 2:25 AM, and I am bawling my eyes out. This content in on itself is so freaking raw and beautiful, and it feels like they are stripping down from the idol persona and showcasing themselves. I don't know how else to explain it. The way Mark's eyes were sparkling the whole time and how excited he was even for a thing such as the song being available on all platform just warmed my heart. 😭 Suddenly, my head is filled with the first moment I ever saw him and I was like ""this kid is going places"". It was 2014 and he was on an episode on an EXO show (90:2014). The moment I heard him say ""Hello my name is Mark Lee and I am a fifteen-year-old Canadian"" I was already in deep. I was waiting for the day when he would debut and see what he has to bring to the table as an artist and boy DID HE DELIVER. It's been an honor seeing him grow up not only as a person (through my screen) but also an artist. There is so much love and pride when I think of Mark and I hope he knows that  he is appreciated and loved. CHILD is utterly beautiful and I resonate with it thinking back of my own days as a teen. Thank you doesn't even begin to cover it, but Mark - THANK YOU! For sharing a piece of you with us, and for giving us your all every single time. You are amazing and an inspiration and it is an honor being your fan. 🙏💚",65,2022-02-12T00:39:33Z
@mayas87,"Damn this song is amazing!!! 😍 so many emotions and vibes in just one song, and i love how it's not the typical sm style, but it's somehow unique to Mark. It really does portray the title ""child"" perfectly because a child is several stages of life not just one, and we go through so many emotions, which is perfectly portrayed through the different styles of music. Ugh this song is amazing, imma be listening to it on repeat now 😍😍",6,2022-02-12T00:39:29Z

I can envision my future in a way I want it to be but I am unsure and would like someone to guide me or better yet, “hold my hand” like a child. I don’t want to drift far from this society but be an part of it. I’m a child, I can’t be the person I want… yet. Would there be anyone who can relate?

Every time I heard him and see him .. I ca n't help my self but to feel emotional for loving him and being proud and so happy for achieving his dream of him. Always remember Mark that we are all here for you, always and forever loving and supporting you. WE GOTCHA YOU! Hehehehe",1,2022-02-11T22:44:52Z

@nhu.d.e,"Watching that performance of Mark was somehow very emotional,
maybe it's because there's this loneliness and pain that Mark carries and he finally got the opportunity to tell us. 
Still, he tells us through music, something that played a part in building Mark but has also put him in a place of emotional conflicts and questioning. 

I just want to wish Mark the very best. He puts so much meaning and care into what he does, and I think it's so wonderful. 
I hope Mark continues to find meanings and comfort in the difficulties and challenges in life, as he has always done so beautifully.

Mark Lee debuted for so many times. He did experience many other things like different genre in every team he is into which makes it like his another different life experience.

This Mark here was Mark Lee. This show helped him experience his expeditions throughout writing this song. This behind story reached us. He reached us through his music all over again. This man amazes me all the time.

@winwinsonlylinesinboss,"i know mark thought that this song doesn't sound like him at some parts, but man I can't help but think that this song was specifically handcrafted for Mark. Maybe he doesn't see it, but for me this song is definitely screaming Mark Lee. the more i listen, the more i'm like wow 'this is a truly a song where Mark Lee shines.' truly, it's just so perfect for him. and i think it works because it is Mark. had someone else sang this song, I don't think they would be able to give off the same feelings that this song does when Mark sings it. 

and i feel like this song works even better when you start to know who Mark Lee the person is. A man who's spent the latter half of the decade dedicating himself to being an idol in multiple subunits, producing songs, and promoting constantly, nonstop ever since he debuted in 2016. 

A song dedicated to being just a child. how he can't live up to be the person people want him to be. questioning who he is to others, who will he be? how he wants to destroy his responsibilities and just completely run away from society and be a stranger. when did he get so bitter? how he wants and yearns for someone to understand him and relate to him. and even if they can't, he wants them to just pretend, even if it's just for today. 

like wow. lots of growing pains. something so essential and inevitable for young people. it's very sentimental song with a person who exemplifies the song. it's a very Mark song, not only does it sound like him musically, but also it feel like it describes the journey of Mark Lee the artist.",257,2022-02-11T19:37:21Z

@imvalramos,"I suppose 5k comments might be easier to go through 😂 so, if you’re lurking around… Yes. We all connect to adolescence in a way that we can be lonely, experimenting, and especially questioning. Johnny might understand your specific situation better, but we can all resonate with these words. I’m so glad you got to share a new side of you and I’ll treasure this gift. I’m also happy you were encouraged to give singing a try, cause I find your voice extremely calming (but also nostalgic in a way that warms my heart). We all have that childish nature within and your lyrics made me feel young, full of hope and ready to take on new opportunities. 
Why why why kill my night is one of my favorite lines, it feels like such a mature thing to say, but also an extremely MARK thing to say (I can imagine, I feel like you just vibe/resonate and it is what encouraged you to love what you do since you were a child) aaaaanyway… here’s my little rant, love

Mark could actually explain and talk abt his song! the way he wanted it to, he could express himslef in his own way! And thats whats everything abt!
And to have johnny there with him to actually listen and understand him!!!

@indy-windy,"I really enjoyed the interview segment with Johnny. He felt like the perfect person to come and interview Mark about 'Child' and I loved how meaningful it all felt seeing them laugh, smile and talk together. There's just something about hearing 'Child' live that makes you feel even more emotions than even the MV could evoke. Listening to Mark's live performance, I felt like it just hit differently and I could see the MV playing as he sung. It felt like I was almost transported into a different world. I'm glad that even if Mark couldn't see that this song sounded like him, others definitely could and see how much Mark was just written all over it all. The more I hear Child, the more I hear Mark talk, the more I see just what he can do, the prouder I feel. It feels really significant that he was one of the first members to release their solo projects and I'm glad that as a result, we got to see more of just what Mark is capable of doing. I was really happy that Dress suggested to Mark that he should sing, as I really love Mark's singing voice and always wanted him to get more chances to showcase his talents as a singer. His voice is so beautiful. I'm also really touched that Dress did research on Mark to incorporate elements into the song like the guitar that are also a reflection of Mark.",78,2022-02-11T16:20:34Z

I appreciate all the small details that Dress add such as the guitar sound 'cause he notices mark whom always had his guitar around him. I really like this kind of interview 'cause this is just what fans want, to know all of behind the production of a song and what the artist's thoughts of that.

@JM-us7zf,"if i had only one word to describe “Child”, that would be gratitude. I’m sincerely grateful for Mark releasing this wonderful song, which also resonates with me so much and I can see and hear the sincerity behind this song. (Yo, we’re all kids!) Also to hear the story behind the song and also how Mark share his point of view as the artist and performer towards “Child” is just delightful and heartwarming. I’d definitely be very excited to see Mark’s future projects and how he develops and explores further as an artist. Also I’m glad that he has the support from people working with him and that he’s deeply involved in the making of his first official release.💚

Mark’s an excellent singer/rapper/performer as always! The live performance is such a treat!

P.S.: I seriously wish NCT music space would be a regular content from now on. It’s always interesting to hear the story behind a song and the members’ perspective towards their songs. The setting is also warm and perfect, having another member as an interviewer is probably much more comfortable for them and it’s a chance to show their hosting/presenting skills as well.

@chippy9941,"""Child"" as a title is so good. Because Mark still has a lot of things going on in his head. Child is like a version of himself and it really speaks that he has a lot of things to say other than that track. honestly i feel like Mark has a lot of things to offer to us Czennies, but I think he wants us to understand how he feels so that he could guide us to what he is trying to say",28,2022-02-11T15:14:20Z

@rosie5816,"Johnny was the best neo to choose to interview mark. I would also say taeyong  , but I think mark and Johnny share a deep connection beyond words. Johnny has been marks home for a long time , both of them being the only North Americans in nct drew them close to eachother , they speak in English to eachother because mark said it’s weird to speak Koreans and  that’ makes sense considering there mother tongues are English , they bond so we’ll forget. 
Johnny is marks actually brother form another mother and vice verse , tge fact that mark and Johnny’s mom shared the same birthday just show there soulmates. 
Mark was the first one to support Johnny when he did sunny side up and started his dj’ying ans they even made bad smell together with mark writting it and Johnny producing it. Yes taeyong and mark are my favorite music duo. But johnmark honestly can become my favorite go , they way they literally call eacther and meet up to speak about music is so amazing to me.
Yes I know y’all were worried because some of you felt like Johnny wouldn’t take mark seous her but please do relise he loves and respects mark not only has his critter but as an artist to , he’s supported marks music style and has always praised him for his music. Yes Johnny does bully mark but that’s because  he has alot of love for him Johnny once said he teases those he lives the most , so PLEAE understand why he teases mark. Plus everyone teases mark they literally think he’s to adorable not to tease. hell even dream tease  him and that’s there leader and there oldest. My point is though Johnny teases him no one will love mark more than Johnny does. They eachother’s home when there home sick. Remember when Johnny watched that video of him and mark and he tried to speak but he couldn’t be she started crying? He literally choked on his worlds when he watched that video bc I think at that moment he literally relised that him and mark are soulmates , he relised how much he’s seen mark grow he relised how much mark has been there for him and vice versa. Mark was 13 when he met 18 year old Johnny , now mark has blossomed into An amazing 22 year old with 27 year old Johnny still doting on him. Mark and Johnny are the biggest platonic soulmates I’ve ever seen. I love them.",71,2022-02-11T15:14:01Z

Thank you for the beautiful gift you gave us. Thanks to Johnny, I feel like everything I wanted to say to Mark he said it perfectly already.

On different context though, NCT and their staff are really here giving us a lot of quality contents. I want to thanks the creative team behind all NCT content.

Child, it's a song that indeed we can relate to especially in these times that everyone are struggling mentally and physically. Listening to such a song truly gives us strength and comfort because through child we feel that we're not alone for sharing the same struggles, thoughts and feelings. Personally, listening to it feels like healing my inner child. I can't wait to hear your other songs in the future mark!",1,2022-02-11T14:24:09Z

@nah-nah328,"Dang, Mark! Tears starting to fall as Mark explained everything about 'Child', but I really cried a lot when he started to sing 'Child"". I already listened to it a hundred times and I can't stop listening to it, it was now has a special place in my heart. I can't understand it, that's for sure. I'm glad the mv has an English subtitle, then i started to understand it, the feelings, the vibe and the message. I cried when i first watch the mv. The line 'Could someone relate? Can someone understand me just for now' really hit my heart. Coz all this time I always feel out of place wherever I go. I always feel lonely and always think no one can understand me. Mark Lee, thank you for the gift. It really touches my heart, I really love it. Thank you for saying the things I'm afraid to say. Thank you for awakening me. I'm actually pressured this month, and your song really help me, a lot. Thank you very very much!!!",50,2022-02-11T14:03:34Z

You could give anyone a set like that and make them stand and perform in the spotlight alone, but if there's no talent AND charisma AND stage presence it wouldn't really make a difference. And to think he's almost always heavily involved in the production and is practically a bank of so many creative ideas??? It's a shame this isn't a proper solo and especially not a permanent thing for now because I can't wait to see more 😭",281,2022-02-11T14:02:03Z

I try really hard to be a decent adult and show up for work, people and myself. Thing is I think I’ve reached the point that I’ve forgotten about my inner child. I wake up most days feeling so lost and unclear of where I’m heading or what I want to do with my life. Idk I’m struggling to reconnect with what’s left of my youth. The line Different nights, same nightmare hits very real and painful. I guess what I wanted to say is I didn’t expect Mark to come out with this type of song message-wise but thank you.

I mean, no doubt he can rapp perfectly but we still rarely find him singing. So I think it was a clever idea to show off not only his rapp skill but also his vocal too in this song.

@RachelShauna,"9:45 AYO LISTEN UP 

nah but fr tho, i love how Marks first interview about the song making process was w/ Johnny, no bs pre-written statements or anything. it just felt like 2 friends catching up. You can tell Johnny is genuinely proud of Mark & ~resonates~ w/ the song. Mark has always been someone who gets a bit shy when talking about himself so i'm happy SM gave him the opportunity to comfortably discuss a project thats obviously very personal to him. I hope they make more of these videos w/ Johnny as the ""host"". 

Also I hope in 2022 we get more performances w/ live bands, i'm a bit biased since my entire family are all musicians lol but live music always brings out a more raw performance in my opinion",4,2022-02-11T13:42:27Z

@ryeonghee3016,"So I strongly agree, the main theme of CHILD is about questioning ourselves. May be we all have burden, angry, trauma, loneliness, not good enough with ourselves, kind of dillema with all the things happens in our life. To talked about inner child sometimes made some of us like hurting ourselves. The point of distinguish our inner child that he mentioned, somehow it left deep meaning and impression.

@나안-h2r,인터뷰 내내 마크 씨가 엄청 신나고 들떠 보여서 보는 입장에서도 즐겁고 좋았습니다!! 가족 같은 쟈니 형과 함께해서 더 들떴던 것도 같고요ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 라이브 무대도 음원이랑 다른 매력이 있어서 좋았어요. 이렇게 정식으로 프로덕션과 함께 만든 솔로 스테이지를 영상으로 남기는 건 처음이라 마크 씨도 많이 떨렸을 텐데 고마워요!!!! 원래 연말에 내려고 했다던 신나는 바이브의 곡도 언젠가 꼭 듣고 싶네요ㅎㅎ 2022년 마크 씨도 마크프렌즈도 모두 화이팅!!!!!!!!,0,2022-02-11T13:28:33Z
@laoganmaya,"My heart is swelling with pride and could burst due to different emotions as I watched the entirety of the video. I love how Mark looks so excited to talk about his first solo release, how glad he is to receive feedbacks (especially, positive ones) about it, and how serious and dedicated he is for this project. Like, have you seen how bright his smile is and how pretty is the twinkle in his eyes during the interview? I thank Johnny so much too for being here with Mark in this content which makes it so comfortable and so... heartwarming, so special (for the lack of words in my head). For the performance, I am confident that many of us will agree that this is probably better than the studio version because you can clearly feel the emotions in there. I am so proud to see Mark feeling himself while performing his first song. I am in actual tears right now. My love and support for him continues to grow more and more and I do not and will never regret being a fan of him and his works. It has and will always be a pleasure and honor to be a Markf.",0,2022-02-11T13:28:32Z
