@milasunshinekim675,"I've been a CARAT since Clap era & I still cannot get enough of SVT's dance practices/performances. They are such good & expressive dancers (look at Jeonghan, even with his hurt arm he is still dancing well), so watching them dance is mesmerising and calming for me. Like children with cartoons kind of stuff. No thoughts, head empty, just 13 guys dancing perfectly in sync. 
Also 2:13 is sooo satisfying I keep replaying it. Love how even though they're divided in 3 units, they are all rounders as SVT. They ARE the starndard at this point. Anything below it is just average. 🤍",37,2023-02-18T17:33:11Z

@lochan8180,"""And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. And the dead were judged according to their works, by the things which were written in the books.
The sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works. 
Then Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And anyone NOT FOUND written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire."" (REVELATION 20:12-15 NKJV)


Today, while you are still alive and able, may you repent from your sins, believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that JESUS CHRIST is your Lord and Savior, so that through Him, your name will be written in the Book of Life. 


""For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever BELIEVES in Him 
should not perish but have everlasting life. 
For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved."" (JOHN 3:16-17 NKJV)

1. Dino is probably their most underrated member & has had a glow-up since the Attacca era 💗
2.  Mingyu & Vernon - both acknowledged for visuals but underrated dancers

@yipyip4177,"THIS CHOREO IS SUCH A BANGER R U KIDDING ME. i love how smooth and witty the transitions are to new formations. there is so so much going on that it can appear a bit messy at some parts but that's what makes the transitions so so impressive; it's how quick and fast paced it is for them to make the transition of the new formation AND still be able to be understandable to the audience's eyes

like how hoshi quickly fades away from the center role from his line at 0:32 to passing the attention to dk at 0:37 by letting the whole group do the same dance move thus the viewers bringing their eyes to view the formation as a whole now and noticing the center which is dk. we have our eyes so focused on hoshi we don't really get to comprehend what's happening in the bg but as soon as dk's line begins everything just becomes instantly clear in a flash. some wizard magic goin on. THIS PRINCIPLE APPLIES AGAIN TO JEONGHAN'S LINE  AT 1:33 .. we focus on him so much that the transition to woozi center that starts off a bit clunky (because of all the sprinting and skipping happening in the bg lolol) that it's so so cool  how it smoothly instantly becomes a clearer as soon as jh becomes a part of the whole at 1:37, passing the eye of the audience to woozi next.

OR HOW THE8 AT 1:28 ALBEIT AT THE SIDELINE OF THE PART QUICKLY COMES TO VIEW AS THE CENTER FOR HIS LINE  BECAUSE OF HOW QUICK THEY FORM THE FORMATION  OF THE DUO LINES WHILE STILL BEING ABLE TO LET THE AUDIENCE'S VIEW EASILY ADJUST AND COMPREHEND IT 

OR AT HOW VERNON AT 1:13 BREAKS THE 13 PERSON FORMATION AND QUICKLY (SOMEHOW) MELTS INTO JUST 5 PEOPLE. IT HAPPENS SO FAST BUT WE CAN STILL EASILY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON ++ THE WAY HE PASSES THE CENTER TO SCOUPS!!! IT JUST INSTANTLY MELTS AWAY IT'S MAGICAL 

im geeking out so so much this was done so well . everything i say is practically incomprehensive but main takeaway is i love the choreo. i was in awe the whole damn time it's so so fun it's literally magic T_______T so so amazing",0,2022-07-23T13:47:18Z

@ScarletCloud,"I've just noticed in this choreo video the beautiful, creative (and kinda meaningful?) transition in 2:08. 

Jun's singing in the middle, next is Dino so he moves forward to the center. Then, in just a few seconds, Mingyu, Wonu and Vernon reagroup with Coups. Meanwhile, JeongHan, Joshua and Kwan run to reagroup with Woozi and DK. Vocal unit and hip hop unit moves in spiral during Mingyu and Seungkwan parts, and the center is being fullfilled with the performance unit having their own moves.

Edit: after seeing it again, more than spiral, it remind me more of the typical representation of the day, where sun and moon are moving to the same direction, opposite positioned, and Earth is in the middle.

역시 이렇게 보니까 안무가 너무 예쁜 것 같아요
멤버들 웃으면서 안무하니까 너무 예쁘고 같이 웃게 돼요 그리고 안무긴 노래랑 너무 잘 어울려서 어떻게 매 앨범마다 다 다른 안무를 만들어서 보여주는지 너무 신기하고 대단해요
이 안무보다 더 좋은 안무가 나올까 싶은데  세븐틴이 가지고 나오니까 자랑스럽고 볼 때마다 새롭고 매 앨범마다 좋은 모습 보여주려고 노력해주는 세븐틴 늘 고마워요",0,2022-07-23T13:16:58Z
