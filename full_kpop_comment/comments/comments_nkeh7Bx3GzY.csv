@alleyrosee,I'm amazed by how synchronized they are. It must've taken days of practice to get this sort of perfection. And the effort they have put into it is beyond outstanding. It's a really touch choreo and you can see how they were panting at the end. I'm surprised more people aren't talking about it. I'm not even a stay but this is definitely one of the best songs with the best choreography I've come across.,6,2025-02-14T21:43:13Z

OKAAYYYY can we speak about the count + the timing + the precision + the time to does the step on the floor and imediatly go back up and continue at god speed the rest of choreo >->
it's just hard as f**k and probably everyone who try the whole choreo by itself discover new muscle cramp during the whole process or how hard it is to make perfect and classy ground choreo and not looks like a fat old noodle leftover.",1,2024-12-29T20:01:20Z

이 가게는 참 메뉴가 고르기도 쉽죠
뭘 시켜도 오감을 만족하지 하지
지나가던 나그네, 비둘기까지
까치까지 까마귀들까지

Cooking a sauce 입맛대로 털어
음미하고 lick it 말해 bon
Taste so good 반응은 모두 쩔어
But 모두 자극적인 거
I want it till 다 먹일 때까지
연구하지 cross boundaries
경계 따위 없어 마치 창조하듯 소리를 만들지

그저 계속 만들어가 새롭게
Because we’re one of a kind
누구도 따라 할 수 없는 our own game

Cookin’ like a chef I’m a 5 star 미슐랭
“미”의 정점을 찍고 눈에 보여 illusion
Whoo 첨 느꼈지 이런 감정
놀랄 거야 gonna shock 바로 감전

자물쇠 따 싹 다 unlock
Idea bank 머릿속을 털어 털어
비밀재료가 궁금하다면
사실 우린 그딴 거 안 써

@borile.milino,"you know, a lot of kpop groups have at least 2 or more people in the group that make the dance look incomplete. I appreciate how everyone in kpop tries their best, but their lack of skills sometimes can't go unnoticed, but with stray kids their dancing is all matching, they are all extremely beautiful dancers, and I just think that they all share similar skill which makes their group dance 10X better. When you have someone very lacking in a very skilled group, you hurt both that person's self esteem and the groups performance, so it's really nice how they all balance eachother out well and have similar skill levels. I would be surprised if anyone read all that 'cause I know I wouldn't but if you did thanks 😘",13,2023-06-24T22:48:34Z

@h-playwithmyhart.4806,"Bang Chan. As I’ve frequently noted, I have been a K-Pop fan for almost a decade but I have never seen somebody like you in the musical field before. What you have been and are capable of, is absolutely untouchable and I’ve learned that there is nothing that can take the sincerity and passion out of your character. I will say, despite being a long-time fan of K-Pop, I didn’t become a Stay until the just a few years ago. I don’t know how I went so long without knowing or supporting Stray Kids sooner, but I am completely and utterly thrilled to be a Stay now. To this day I wouldn’t know about Stray Kids if it weren’t for the Stay. I heard so much conversation among the fans of Stray Kids about how fearless of a leader you were, and I became curious. Over the course of those few years, I have spent my free time, which I lately have a lot of, getting to know you and your members. It started with liking a few songs, but then Stay, who talk with so much praise about you and your members, convinced me to see what was lying beneath the meaning of your music. I began to watch Stray Kids content whenever and of whatever I could, and I gradually fell more in love with your performance and personality overall. I have come to know how passionate and dedicated you are and have always been to music and performing. Even before Stray Kids was officially formed and debuted, you had music in your heart and I can see that clearly every time that you go on stage with your members. Not only do you have a naturally beautiful voice evident of vocal capability and strength, but your dancing skills are rigid and flawless beyond words. Your presence on stage is nothing less than inspirational and you ground and center your members in a way that I’ve never seen before. You always bring everyone together and emit unity on and off the stage. Outside of your musical performances, however, I have gotten the pleasure of getting to know you and your personality. I don’t even really know where to start by how touched I am at the positive impact you have already made on this world despite still having so much more left to say. Before I became a Stay, I didn’t know much about what Stray Kids had gone through to get where they are now; and I didn’t know just how much you went through either. However, the loving Stay introduced me to how hard you worked individually to keep your members’ heads above water through the rigorous days of training, performing, and other events that swarmed you. I was, and still am absolutely mesmerized at what you have accomplished to make this group possible, and successful beyond its comprehension. Thanks to the Stay, I know that before Stray Kids even debuted, you formed an unbreakable and unique bond with each of the members as well as one together as a whole. You lift your members up with the emotional and motivational weight of all the words that you’ve ever said to them. To know that there would be no Stray Kids without you makes me love you in a manner that is simply indescribable. I know that I, your members, and the Stay have so much respect and admiration for you because of everything that you’ve done and overcome in just the beginning of your musical journey. I have gotten the honor of seeing at least some of the group’s history and how it came to be, and seeing how you were a huge part of that makes me appreciate having you in my life more than I did before. You have single-handedly helped carry this group to victory and done so much to ensure that you stay together. You have always kept your promise that you, in words that I once heard you say, “Don’t leave anybody behind.” On top of leading your group to all of its success and glory, your are also humble and kind and always put them first. You sacrifice so much for your music, your members, and Stay and we recognize how hard you work day in and day out. You are so funny, clever, and know not to take life too seriously. At the same time you are professional, intelligent, respectful, and wise beyond your years. You are every bit qualified to be the leader that you are and I hope you never doubt your capability of doing that because Stay have seen you build something beautiful with your own two hands from the ground up. You never gave up even when the world encouraged you to and from that I find so much inspiration that I don’t even know how how to thank you. All I do know is that your family and parents are the most proud of you and love you more than any of us do. I can’t even imagine how strong they think you are for what you’ve created. I don’t want to put any more pressure or a burden on you, but so much would crash and burn without you and I hope that our love and support is enough to lift you up through your darkest times. You deserve so many blessings and praise. I just hope that you know your efforts are being recognized every second and that Stay, your members, and your family love you beyond words. I can’t thank you enough for everything that you’ve already done. You make Stay and your members feel so valued and desired and I know that only you can do that. I can’t wait to see what you do next because I know that I couldn’t leave you or stop supporting you if I tried. On behalf of your friends, Stay, members, and most importantly family, I pray that this birthday is filled with all of those blessings that you deserve and that it’s everything that you desire. I pray that you and your loved ones remain in good good health and good faith, because the world is relying on it in order to fully heal and love each other. Happy birthday Bang Chan, and from the bottom of my heart, we absolutely adore you!! You make Stray Kids all around the world stay!!!",14,2022-09-30T23:03:23Z

@h-playwithmyhart.4806,"Felix. You have to be one of the biggest blessings on this Earth. I know that I crossed paths with Stray Kids for a reason, and I know you were one of those reasons. Before I even knew anything about Stray Kids, I knew about you. Three years ago, when I got my introduction to K-Pop and was beginning to like quite a few groups, I didn’t know much about Stray Kids, but I did know about you. I couldn’t go anywhere without hearing anybody talk about you, and that was what lead me into wanting to find out more about you, and your position in Stray Kids. I came into the fandom blindly, without knowing any of the names of the members, and relied on the Stay to tell me everything I needed to know about you. It was because of the intense loving fanbase that you have that I learned, in only a matter of days, what a rare talent you are. The depth of your voice combined with your passionate vocals is one of the most beautiful sounds I have ever heard. Your rapping and singing abilities are entirely specific to you and are so captivatingly intriguing, that I knew I loved you from the moment I first got introduced to you. You are so flexible with your voice and on the stage; and once I first got notice of how outstanding you are, I couldn’t stop discovering what made you so enticing and lovable. You are so recognized and appreciated for your natural talent that word reached me about how special you are before I even got a chance to know who Stray Kids really were. Since then, I have been a Stay, and I can say that you are an individual that led me to become one. I have never seen someone with such a bright presence and spirit completely dominant on stage and create an environment so mysterious and energetic for so many people. You bring to music what nobody else can, and I am so happy you share that with all of your Stay when you could be doing something else. I see how happy that you make your members, and since I am a relatively new fan, I still have yet to learn everything that Stray Kids has been through in the years that you’ve been active. However, I have already seen how much you have healed your members when they needed you the most and provided for Stay a support system that they can actually believe in. You are such a delight to be around and I get so happy just seeing your face these days, especially with all of the craziness that’s in the world. You have a strong-willed heart, and you are extremely kind, forgiving, and non-judgmental. I have loved becoming so acquainted with you and appreciating all of your hard work because you deserve it! You do so much for everyone, and I hope you know that you are so loved and Stay are so grateful to you for even the little things that you do every single day! Never give up and I hope you continue to be the person that uplifts Stay and your members! I know that no matter what happens, Stay will always support you and I can’t tell you how much you really mean to all of us. Thank you so much for being such a kind and loving human being, and for accepting me and so many people into your family as Stay! I pray that you and your loved ones stay safe, and find happiness and worth in the future. On behalf of your friends, members, Stay, and most importantly, your family, I want to wish you the most entertaining and enjoyable birthday ever!! Felix, have fun, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, stay safe, Happy, Birthday, and WE LOVE YOU!!!",10,2022-09-14T17:27:54Z

@h-playwithmyhart.4806,"Seungmin, I would like to wish you an early happy birthday, as the time is drawing close. My introduction to Stray Kids was unique in that the reason I decided to support it was because of the fans. I have been a K-Pop fan for almost a decade, and I have come to support many groups. However, becoming a Stay was a new experience for me because it was the first time that I joined a group because the love from the fans was so strong, I knew I needed to be a part of it. I learned about each Stray Kids member one at a time, and what I learned and admired very quickly about you was your individuality. Every member stands out for their own reasons, but your charm is retaining your individuality and independence while still being a part of something bigger. I became an official Stay two years ago, and since then I have gotten to see how well you blend in with your members. You are such a valued member of Stray Kids, that we can’t see them existing without you. You’ve also created a journey of personal growth and development both musically and personally and I have felt so connected to you since I’ve become a Stay. Your personality is so enticing in that sometimes you can be quiet and shy, but other times you are very vocal and humorous with your members. It’s very powerful that you can be so sweet and naturally kind-hearted without saying any words sometimes, while other times, being open and direct about how you feel. I can see how much your loving personality has impacted your members, because I’ve never seen them happier than when you spend time with them. You are always making your members laugh and motivating them just by putting one smile on their face. I feel so inspired watching you build such a trustworthy relationship with them and want to be at least half as generous as you. I know that your members are so thankful for you everyday and couldn’t be anywhere near as successful without you. I have never heard a fanbase talk so highly and frequently of a member in the way that they honor you. I always hear Stay talking about how gentle and sweet you are; and how much positivity and love you bring to the world wherever you go. Stay talk about your rare, emotion-based, and versatile voice that captivates everyone into your performance. They talk about the flawless and effortless dancing that you work so hard to share with us and spoil us with on every stage. They talk about your overall professional and inspirational performance on stage that leaves every Stay wanting to spend more time with you. I’ve heard so much about how beloved you are Seungmin, and once I became a Stay, I am seeing for myself how much you are adored all over the world. Not only by Stay, but the loving influence that you have on your members makes them and everyone that you meet a kinder and more loving person. Stay praise and speak so highly of you, that I can’t say I’ve experienced a family this loving toward an idol. I just want you know how much love there is everywhere all around the world for you. You are the reason that so many people lift their heads up and keep going another day, including me. There is so much negativity going on in the world right now, and to have you as a role model and see it not preventing you from sharing more love is making the world even stronger and closer to restoring to its greatness. I really feel like we don’t deserve you sometimes because your genuine strong heart is hard to come across these days. I hope that we can repay you even a little bit of the love you’ve shown us in just a few years since your debut. I know you have worked so hard to be where you are and I don’t even want to pretend to know how much you’ve probably gone through. I just want to take this day, and every day afterwards to recognize and let you become aware of how much I, Stay, and your members really love you. I know that your parents and the rest of your family are prouder of you than any other person and they respond to every action you take with great respect, understanding, and love. Your members and family are so lucky to have you and I know that are thankful and appreciative of you every day. Thank you so much for sacrificing more than we know just to make us happy even a little bit. On behalf of your friends, members, Stay, and loving family, I hope that the love that you have given to this world is given back to you on this special day and every day in your future. Please surround yourself by the people that love you most, and let the love that we have for you give you the most fulfillment! I wish you nothing but happiness for you and your loved ones, and I pray that you all stay safe. Happy birthday Seungmin! We adore you so much and we are so grateful to have such a bright light in our lives!!!!!",2,2022-09-04T23:38:10Z

@inalake_,"random things i noticed: (from an intermediate dancer's perspective)
0:08 i just KNOW that was an annoying arm position for everybody, especially hyunjin
0:13 in just this formation you can clearly see everybody's different dance styles, like it looks the same if you dont pay attention but if you do it's really cool
0:16 ok the balance for here would have taken me FOREVER to get. props on that, not a trace of a stumble with the knee push thing.
0:20 here again you can see the difference in style if you slow it down a bit
0:27 the way that han, hyunjin, and felix are all using their centre of balance here is really cool - not to mention, felix is on the balls of his feet pretty much the entire move. like, WOW.
0:30 i just wanted to mention how gracefully lee know did the woah here thats all
0:31 the sharpness is EVERYTHING here, and that move is a really good example of how you can be light on your feet and still execute moves sharply (bc they switch standing legs twice shortly after, so they can't get too grounded)
0:35 you're probably gonna see me say this a lot if u read this entire thing, but THE JUMPS? it's so cool - they're barely getting off the floor so that they can keep moving, but they're extending their body so it looks like they're going higher. they did this in miroh too, they just tucked in their legs to make it seem like they were jumping a lot higher.
0:43 IN got up on his knee? why? i mean it looked amazing, but why would u bruise ur knee here? idk if the dance floors are different in this studio, but in mine i avoid taking knees at ALL COSTS. props to IN if he has been practicing it like that too cause jesus that hurts.
0:48 its the conscious amount of swag that they're putting into this walk that's getting me - everybody's walking heel ball toe to the EXTREME
0:51 i've tried this so many times - how on earth do they travel? well, i finally know. THEY'RE PICKING UP ONE FOOT. WHY WOULDN'T THEY?? idk why, but ive been learning this as a shoe stuck to floor thing. sigh.
0:56 if you pay VERY close attention to everybody's hands here you'll notice that none of them are the them are the same, so another subtle style difference that i feel is worth mentioning. (for example, Bang Chan's hands are in a very gymnastics-y pose, whereas IN's are blades, and... man idk what han is doing with his hands but go off)
0:58 ive been waiting for a moment to talk about this too - everybody, but especially IN, uses their plier really well here - this is a moment where IN has to jump high and far, and you can see that he pliers slightly more than everybody else to do so. And Changbin, who jumps a little lower and travels less only really pliers one of his legs.
1:04 Hyunjin starts turning slightly sooner then everybody else, to through thorough bullsh*ttery i have decided is because he either a) just does that normally, or b) is doing that because he's center

ok i got lazy but here's that and if this gets likes i'll do more",0,2022-08-12T01:45:18Z

@h-playwithmyhart.4806,"Changbin. I’m so fortunate to be able to celebrate your birthday with the rest of Stays. I would like to talk about your musicality. I’ve never heard anybody rap like you, and I know I won’t hear anybody rap like you for the rest of my life. You have this growl, this grit, that is enough to supply every word you say with the perfect amount of power and character that it needs. No matter what the circumstance is for your song, you retain this originality and this sound that nobody else has. The connection between the raps you create and your execution of them is simply seamless.  Your lyrical style is mesmerizing, and watching these musical ideas pop into your head like second nature is truly astonishing. You can also sing beautifully as well, and the rough texture of your voice gives you this edge that lights up all of your lines. It is rare to see somebody be able to master both singing and rapping, and the unique sound of your voice allows for you to become limitless through both. You are also an incredibly skilled dancer. Your moves are so natural, and watching you feels surreal because you become so immersed in your movement. You absorb all of these choreographies, and then interpret them in such a realistic and emotional way. You have so much power and when you dance, yet you have the right amount of control to give off just the perfect amount of expression. You give care to each little gesture, and treat each move with such delicacy. It is a journey from start to finish when you dance, and you take all of us with you without missing a single detail along the way. Overall, you are one among other artists that sincerely represent our generation and capture its essence. Your innovation and relationship with music are so complex and clear at the same time. You are young, but as you become older and more experienced, there is no telling what you’re already curious and inventive mind will supply to the world. Your impact on music and your Stay will be timeless. At the same time that I love your musicality, I love your personality as well. I first noticed that you are so laid-back and have this calming demeanor. You are also unexpectedly hilarious. You make jokes in moments where nobody anticipates and you can change the entire mood of a situation in mere seconds. You are so humble, and place those around you before you no matter what the circumstances. Though I have never met you in person, you have to be one of the best people to be around and I know that your members know this better than anybody else. You really hold your team down, and together, and always find a way to make sure everybody feels included. It has only been a short time since I’ve known you, but I saw almost instantly how your members individually love and cherish you in their own special way. You bring the excitement and thrill of life to them wherever and whenever they need it. You have the biggest heart. You have stood your members up time and time again and pointed them in the right direction if ever they forget what they are chasing after. You are somebody they can lean on through all instances in their life; and have become their brother. We all know that you provide your members with a love that they could not get from anybody else. Though they are all different, you find a way to embrace this and form a sacred relationship with each of them. I know that they will continue to grow and develop, but only with you by their side to guide them through it all. They will continue to be the best versions of themselves and there is nothing that can hold them back because you believe in them with all of your heart and soul. Your love will always trail them and aid them for the rest of their lives. Thank you for raising them, and changing their lives forever so that they can lead the fullest life possible. I want to personally thank your family and parents for raising you and helping you become the aspiring young man you are today. I know how much your family means to you, and you have firsthand showed us what they mean to you and how you spend your time with them. It is clear to see that you already keep this in mind with you at all times, but I just want to say that I hope you can always rely on them in your life when you find you need somebody. When you find yourself having troubles down the line, I hope you can remember the feeling of being with them to restore you to your former state of peace and optimism. Your family loves you more than anybody else on this planet, and I hope you know that when you feel there is nobody who can understand, they will always be there to help you out of any tough situation. They are the most proud of you, will always be the most proud of you, and you honor them with every step you take towards your dream. As Stay, we keep them in our hearts as you do and hope to become as dedicated and authentic through all that we do as they are. Changbin, it is often said that Stay are the luckiest fandom in the world, and I can wholeheartedly agree with that as you are responsible for the truth behind this. You are extremely sensitive and considerate of all of our feelings, and that is perhaps one of the aspects of you that I love the most. You seem to always listen to what we have to say and are even eager to respond to it. When discussing Stay with your members or others, you always have the most original ideas and show us how much you love us through your own eyes. When we chose to become a Stay, you chose us. Your world opened up to us and you invited us to become every bit of a part of you as your members and family.  Similarly to your members, there are Stay from all over the world who come from different backgrounds, and it is only because of you that we are able to come together in unity. I know it’s not always easy to let us in and to see us while you’re in a tough situation, but the fact that you put your fears aside and show up for us every time is the greatest testament of your love for us. You are the first person we turn to when we are down and need cheering up. It is truly the greatest honor getting to be the ones that you work so hard for and trust it all to. You have faith in us when we don’t, and it gives us enough confidence to tackle whatever is thrown at us. Thank you for loving us unconditionally, and being there when nobody else has. Thank you for changing our lives, and being at the heart of the greatest days of our lives. I know that you’ve been through a lot, and you’ve only been active with Stray kids for a few mere years. I’ve seen firsthand how it took all you had and then some to even debut, and there have been too many struggles since then that you’ve faced. The best that I can do, knowing that you’ve been in these difficult situations more than anybody should be in, is try to imagine how it feels to be in your shoes. I know that it’s been a lot. All that I can say, on behalf of all of your loved ones, that we are so proud of you for making it past all of these moments. You have a heart a gold and always keep your head up even when it feels impossible, and I know that this is the reason why you’ve been able to persevere through all that you’ve been through. Thank you for teaching us that we can do the same, and for having enough ability to force a fulfilled live for your Stay and members a well. We know that you can take charge and make it out of whatever happens in the future. I hope that this birthday makes all of your dreams come true and that you accmplish all that you desire on this special day. I often wonder of when you get to take a break and truly look back on the impact that you’ve had on the world, so I hope that if anything, your special day provides you for the perfect opportunity to do that. I hope you are able to look at the countless hearts that you touch every day around the world in limitless ways, and let that make you feel as loved and honored as you’ve ever felt. I hope that those around you also help you to see how worthy of love and commemoration that you truly are. Please relax today and I hope that you spend every second making precious memories. I hope that this day goes down as one of the greatest you’ve had in a while. You deserve all of the sucess and blessings, and I know that more will only come to you. Thank you for sacrificing so much just to make Stray Kids and several other projects possible. Thank you for suffering through any pain, concern, fear, doubt, isolation, confusion, fatigue, stress, and so much more just to bring us any content at all. I hope that you never feel pressured or obligated to change because you are a rare gem of a human being. The world, and more specifically, your Stay need you just as you are to continue to inspire us and remind us what it is to love others and yourself in daily life. You are beautiful inside and out, and perfect as you are. I hope you remember we always will support you no matter what! I pray that you and your loved ones stay safe, and find happiness and worth in the future! Happy birthday Changbin, and we adore you so much!!!!",5,2022-08-10T06:23:12Z

@h-playwithmyhart.4806,"Hyunjin. It was certainly your musicality that drew me to you first. You have such a playful but easy tone which highlights and gives definition to every Stray Kids song. You don’t have fixated or set rapping style. You are very experimental vocally and lyrically and I’ve found myself charmed by your voice due the versatility of it. I also love your singing style for similar reasons. You are just as diverse of a singer as you are rapper. It is really peaceful and harmonious; and blends perfectly with the rest of your members. I love how you don’t hold anything back when you’re singing and I can really feel the emotion and work that you pour into each line that you sing. Similarly to your singing and rapping, your body knows no limits when you are met with a choreography. You dance with a ferocity and a passion that no other performers can possess. You take each choreography and sincerely make it your own, which is honestly a blessing to watch. When you are dancing, you can be yourself and express your emotions with the beauty of your body movements. You can lose yourself easily into your dance and you are so comfortable and trusting of your own abilities. For this generation specifically, you have transformed music and given new meaning to what it can and should do for people. You are changing the world each day that you continue to share your artistry and dance; and we are so lucky to be alive right now to get to be a part of the history that you’re making. At the same time that I love your music and dance, I love your personality as well. I love that sometimes you keep to yourself, but other times, you are goofy and outgoing. As I mentioned before, you are extremely freeing to be around and those who spend time with you can relax and be themselves in your presence. I know that nobody can attest to these qualities quite like your members. Seven different personalities, and they all love you and cherish you for their own special reasons. They’ve looked to you and have modeled their perseverance off of how you strive to not let the difficult times hold you down and prevent you from success. You have opened your heart up to all seven people, although you come from different backgrounds, and that has encouraged them to all to have such a loving relationship with one another. You’ve had love for them since you began your journey with them and this has establishing a lifelong love that all of you had before you even debuted. You see the beauty and necessity of every single member and constantly remind them how important they are to Stray Kids. There is likely no greater feeling for them than knowing that they have you by their side if they don’t have anything else. The most important takeaway is the time they spend with you and the way you make them feel, and these are both filled with warm memories they can take with them for the rest of their lives. You’ve already spent some of the happiest and life-changing moments of your life with them, and there is still more to come. The members of Stray Kids, also your brothers and your family, couldn’t have somebody who loves them any more than you do to look after them. You are always so considerate of them and their feelings and respond to them however they need. They are the best versions of themselves because of you and because you love them just the way they are. Now, they can go on to do whatever they aspire to because you’ve encouraged them with that confidence. I want to personally thank your parents and family for raising you and helping you become the person you are today. I know they mean a lot to you, and that you couldn’t be here doing what you are without their love and support. Because of them, you can use your platform to share with the world the same love that they have provided you with your whole life. I hope you never forget that they are always going to be the most proud of you no matter what you do. They love you most in this world and they do so in a way that nobody else understands. Stay love them as you do and we keep them in our hearts as we continue our time with you. We are so grateful to them for bringing you into the world, and for changing the world the same way that you do. Hyunjin, you touch each individual heart of every Stay, and this is easily one of the most charming parts about you. It is in your nature to make each and every Stay feel special, even if you don’t know us personally. You welcome Stay from all around the world with open arms, and I felt as if I was a part of the family my whole life. You are so dedicated to your Stay and this is very apparent in everything that you do, whether it be performing or communicating with us directly. You have so much compassion for Stay and I feel like we are existing in our own separate world with you. Although we all live in different areas across the world, you take us to a place where we can all be one big family together, and it is one of the greatest feelings in the world. What you give to us is irreplaceable, and there could never be another person who helps us see the worth in ourselves the way you do. You also help us love one another. You influence others to treat others with kindness and I’ve met some of the most heartwarming Stay. I know that you help this family become closer every single day, and you remind us that if we have nothing else, we have each other. You invite us into your heart, the same way that you do your members, and you see qualities in us that we don’t even see ourselves. I know for a fact that there are Stay who only believe in themselves because of you. You also share so much of yourself with us, and this is perhaps one of the biggest ways you can show somebody that you trust. As time goes on, I notice you revealing more of yourself through your music and just through direct conversation with your Stay. You have gotten so personal with us and this lets us know just how much you actually believe in us and trust us to keep these parts of you within our hearts. There is no greater honor than to have you place this vulnerable side of you in our hands, and we want to do the same for you. I know that it is not always easy to do this, so I hope you know that we could never mislead you or betray your trust if we wanted to. You are one of the most generous people we know, and we could not be here giving love to others and to you without the love that you gave us first. I know that you’ve been through a lot, both personally, and professionally, and that your time as an idol has not always been easy or enjoyable. You’ve been active for some time now, but during your training period alone, you’ve been met with demanding expectations, which many people cannot even say they’ve undergone. Just as your family is, Stay could not be more proud of you from overcoming your hardships and making it out on the brighter side. Each time you are met with a grueling time or task, thought it make time, you eventually endure through it until the end, and become more experienced. As Stay, I can say we learn so much from how you choose to release stress or convey how you’re feeling through the mediums that provide you comfort.  We are beyond proud of you and continue to learn from you each day. I hope that this birthday makes all of your dreams come true, and you can take the time to truly celebrate who you are as a person. I know it might be difficult to focus on yourself, and if you find this to be the case, I hope you leave it to those who surround you and your admiring fans from all across the world to help you realize how revolutionary of a person you are. You are truly a gifted musician, and a courteous and selfless individual. You deserve this day, and every day that follows, to feel as appreciated as you truly are. I hope that every second is filled with memories that are unforgettable, and that this will be one of the greatest days that you’ve had! Please have fun and celebrate in whatever way you choose, because your Stay will be cheering with you!  Thank you for sacrificing your time, efforts, pain, doubt, fear, tears, emotions, and physical boundaries just to bring us any content at all. For every effort that you put in that you might think is small, a Stay’s mood or day is completely changed for the better. You are blessing to this world and continue to change it every day with how you choose to heal it and the people living in it. I hope you don’t overwork yourself because you are perfect just the way you present yourself to us. We will support you and be there for you for the rest of our lives! I pray that you and your loved ones stay safe, and find happiness and worth in the future. Happy birthday Hyunjin, and we adore you so much!!!!",66,2022-03-20T06:20:59Z

@h-playwithmyhart.4806,"I.N.  You immediately stood out to me because of how seriously you take your role in the music of Stray Kids. I knew nothing about you when I first discovered Stray Kids, but from the music videos that I watched, you embodied the spirit and character of every Stray Kids concept so well that it left me speechless. You were the reason that every Stray Kids video felt like a mystery to me, and I found myself always wanting to know more. You blew me away from first sight because of how talented you are. You have one of the sweetest, most youthful sounding and powerful voices I’ve head. To have a voice like this is already unique, but again, you being so young is even more marvelous. You have this light and refreshing voice that’s capable of accomplishing so much. I always feel like I’m surprised when I hear it because each time you sing, you show your Stay a new side of you. When I hear you sing from one song to the next, I can feel your growth and am left stunned by the surprise of new elements that emerge from your vocal ability. I love that your voice fits easily with every type of Stray Kids song. You’re always experimenting with the different capabilities of your voice, but I love that you retain the classic sound and characteristics that personalize your voice. All the same, you are a gifted and expressive dancer. Your facial expressions successfully guide all of your dance numbers and completely dominate the essence of each performance. You move with such strength and determination. You really tell a story with your actions and your facial expressions when you hit the stage. I know that you want to give your audience every part of you and it is so clear to see when you put on a performance. You execute each move perfectly and your connection to the performance enlightens the experience for your Stay and your members alike.  Your movements are controlled and every detail is perfected. Overall, you are a musician who knows exactly how to make a statement each time that you perform. You don’t just get on stage, but each time you do, it’s unforgettable because you know how to speak to your audience members. Along with the individuality in your performance etiquette, I love your personality all the same. I first thought that you were quiet all of the time, but I learned that there is an extrovert that comes out of you when the moment’s right. I love this about you because I know that so many people who can resonate with you on this. There are times when you are soft-spoken, and times where you have so much energy and communicate well with others. I love that the people close to you can understand you and are familiar with you in this way. Another trait that I noticed that you possessed with humor. It’s not often that I can see people make others laugh both intentionally and unintentionally. Even without saying much, you cause an uproar among your members and I know that this is part of the reason that they love interacting with you so much. They know you are capable of completely setting the mood for a great time or for turning their day around. I always find myself laughing at the silly things you say and the way you react to certain situations is always an opportunity to create happiness for your members. In general, I just love the relationship that you have with your members. You haven’t been active for very long as a group, and I know you all have different personalities, but you’ve fit right in with them since day one. You have this natural chemistry with them, and I know that they accept and love you just as you are. As I mentioned before, you don’t even have to say much but you can ignite a spark of pure delight and joy when you’re with them. It is so admirable that you have this ability to put a smile on somebody’s face so easily. Just by being around you, your members are automatically more relaxed and just carefree. I haven’t even been a Stay for long, but I noticed almost instantly how sacred you are to them. They know you well enough already to respect you and understand you no matter how you choose to carry yourself. I can also see that you’re almost like a human stuffed animal in that you provide so much comfort for them. Whenever they’re feeling down, worried, or just feel like being affection, they always turn to you to give their love. I find it sensational that they can rely on you or depend on you for always being there, simply because it is how you are naturally. You don’t have to try, but you are such a kind and sweet person that you don’t even have to use words to show it. We can tell by how much of yourself that you give to your members that you treasure them as much as they you. You’ve already left a lasting impact on Stray Kids as a group, but more importantly, you’ve already changed the lives of each of your members individually. You were truly meant to know them and run into them because they are better human beings because of you. You still have so much of your journey left to go with them, and you are already creating memories that last a lifetime. I know that they couldn’t love you more, and they can’t wait to continue on together with you. You’ve already created a lifelong bond with each of them. I want to personally thank your family and parents for raising you and of course, helping you become who you are today. I know that your family are heavily responsible for the love you live know and are the reason you can give love so easily and abundantly as you do today. I know they mean the world to you and Stay are always rooting for them and appreciating them all the same! I hope you never forget that they are the most proud of you and never lose sight of them. Jeongin, you are the absolute source of laughter, light, happiness, and love for your Stay. I know you only get older, but as such a young age you’ve already given so much love to the people that support you. It’s more than we could even imagine. You’ve worked so hard so far to give as much of your heart as you can to Stay and we couldn’t ask for you to do more for us. It’s not easy to offer yourself to so many people as an outlet of entertainment and warmth, but you do it so earnestly without hesitation. I know that you really love your Stay and there is not an action in the world that you could take to prove that any further to us. You mean so much to so many people and you haven’t even shown us all you can do yet. I hope that this helps you become aware of just how wonderful of a person you truly are. I often wonder what may be going through your mind, of what you’re feeling because you always give your smile to Stay. You always want to appeal to us when you’re most confident and selflEss, and doing this every day is the greatest way to show your love for others. I want you to know that in the little ways you communicate with us, you are showing us you care and value us enough to make us feel wanted and desired. This is all Stays could ever ask for. We feel your love each and every day and you don’t have to do anything special to please us. We simply love your company and love that we always have you to turn to. We recognize how hard you work for us and how you become more considerate of us by the second. You are so honest and we never doubt your feelings or concerns because you are making the effort to be vulnerable with us. You show your love for us Stay in your own way and it could never be replaced or experienced in another form. I know that you have been through a lot in your life, both personally and professionally. I’ve seen some of the struggles and emotional moments you’ve gone through both on and off stage, and they are really meaningful to see. It speaks to your character that you trust yourself and us enough to feel these feelings. You don’t bottle them up, and when the time is right to express them, you do. I learn a lot from how honest you are to yourself, your members, and your Stay. I know that this has stayed consistent with you throughout your story so far, and I hope you never lose the ability to reflect on your own thoughts and feelings. I pray that this birthday brings you all of the blessings that you deserve. I hope you know how much there is for you and growing every single day around the world. There is not much that can be done with the pandemic going on, but I wish for you to be surrounded by the people who love you most and who can fill your heart with that love. Please enjoy your day and always remember the unconditional, unwavering love that your Stay will always have in their hearts for you. Thank you for all of the endless hours of practice, doubt, and hardships you’ve endured to bring us anything piece of you. I can already tell that you take your work and your life so seriously and Stay can feel that passion. We are so grateful for what you do for us each day. Something that goes unnoticed to you has the power to change the life of at least one Stay forever. I am so proud of you for all that you’ve overcome, and for never losing yourself Keeping faith and remaining positive is imperative to keep your head up another day, and you’ve never lost that. You are inspirational, motivational, and extremely talented. You deserve all of your success and glory. I can’t wait to see what you do next, and to see your dreams come true along with those of Stray Kids. You were meant to be where you are, and outstanding things are coming your way. Stay knows it! Thank you for all that you do. We love you so dearly. I pray that you and your family members stay healthy, and that you find happiness in the future. Keep shining Jeongin! You are absolutely beautiful! Happy birthday, and we adore you so much!",5,2022-02-08T09:06:49Z

@ICantUseHanguelHere,Everyone including me is talking about hyunjin but let me just say I loved this video as a whole I kept rewinding the transition parts because it was so slick I didn't even notice when members would move forward and switch places like Felix was behind I think Lee Minho I think and he slid out the way and Felix just appeared in the middle do suddenly but it was happening with every member. One second Han is at the back then he's at the front for his part they all kept doing it I'm so obsessed with this choreography. 5 🌟 Michelin review ☺️. Love you guys Stray Kids.

People completely forget about other members as if they were support dancers or that they are not part of or have any relationship with the group. I'm not saying to forget Félix and Hyunjin and treat other members the same as you treat Hyunjin and Félix, but yes, for you to talk about the other boys too.

#2 Felix(looked plain at first but I liked the design on the side very nice)

#3 Leeknow(imma also need me a pair of these I swear this group has the best drip)

#4 Changbin(I actually really like these makes him look a little bit taller too)

#5 Han(these look really comfy and seems like something I'll wear)

#6 Jeongin(don't really have much to say besides it's kinda plain but nothing goes wrong with vans)

for this pre-debut group, Purple Kiss, so that they'd make a full dance cover of it? Most of us Purple Kiss fans also truly want to see them cover it! We think it'd be really nice, cool, amazing, and even more interesting as it's a girl group covering it instead of a boy group, and also because it's a choreography that would showcase these girls' skills really well! Oh, and... Chan may see it, right? So, I think that'd mean a lot to him and the others!",0,2020-12-08T18:19:43Z

I rewatched the mv but couldn't find him or his scenes, i went back to the making of, read the comments & saw what happened. I thought tf? isn't he a member as well?? I wasn't even stanning him but i was so pissed on his behalf 😭 The next song i checked was easy, loved it so much 🔥 My favourite till now it showcases all the members & how talented they are! I discovered that the beautiful Lee know wasn't just ethereal but a whole ass dancing god with the most beautiful smile. I decided to check them out thoroughly, fell for Minho's artistic abilities, his personality, wit & savagness & his beautiful heart. All the members are incredible!

I've tried to learn this and I learned the choreo in 3 days, but when I'm trying to record myself, I look like stupid idiot, the effort and energy I put is not enough to match these guys, not even close!!!. Now I realized how hard this choreo is

Update : I tried to do the DU DU DU DU part with more strength and trying to execute it really hard like hyunjin did. But ended hurting my neck so I can't look right or left for 2 days, lol :'(",694,2020-07-24T17:20:32Z

(00:26) You know when you’re watching a dance video and there is that one person who keeps stealing your attention from all the other dancers? Even when you try to pay attention to the other dancers, this person just keep stealing your attention? Yeah.. the entire group is that one person. This dance (& song) was made to stop you in your track and made you watch it from start to finish. I mean energy? Off the charts! Tastefulness? Off charts! Clean & tight movement? Off the charts! Grit? Off the freaking charts!! This video had me stank facing all the way through... EVERY. SINGLE. TIME!! That’s 9 times that I watched the video (8 individual & 1 collectively). 

Yo.. SKZ.. thank you for your hard work and dedication to slay every movement! I am looking forward to you STAYing just the way you are & I know you will continuously make my eyes STRAY from every other group (besides GOT7💚.. all love though 🤪) that is ever in the same stratosphere as you!

@ay8957,"Let's all channel our anger into something good, which is - 

1. Get god's menu to 100 mil by Changbin's birthday ( at least)
2. Get easy to 10 mil (for now)

3. Vote on Choeaedol for soribada popularity awards, we're currently 9th but we have till 2nd August so it's possible if everyone cooperates
We may not have a strong enough Korean fanbase, so let's show them how strong we are as an international fandom!

4. Vote on mubeat weekly vote we're 1st but the other group could catch up easily
These may seem like small things but they'll actually help promote them in Korea (which is what jyp should be doing)

5. Vote for Changbin on fanplus, 1st place gets times square and subway ads and we're 2nd, we have 5 more days

Just imagine his huge smile when he finds out that there is a birthday ad for him in times square :))
6. Vote on the kking for Seungmin, Felix and Han's birthday, it's in the wide color s category of the subway ad!!

You don't have to vote all day with 10-20 accounts just once is enough. And if you're too busy then at least tell others to do it.

@justbegun9288,"As a Latin Stay  I'm here to say: (comentario en español más abajo) 
1. Continue writing in the comments of mv's recipes, how did you get Stay, a list of your favorite StrayKids songs, a ranking of Go 生, etc. so like this the following mv's would continue be recommend, God's Menu, Blueprint, Easy and tbm TOP if you want ~insert an emoji of a like~
2. Keep doing Str3 @ m of the mv's to get to these numbers
---> God's Menu 100M                                                                                                                           ---> Blueprint 10M
---> Easy 50M (this MV is important because next week it starts its promotions)
---> TOP 5M
But not only of those Mv's also supports Miroh and My Pace to reach 100M of v1ew$.
3. Now that we have won in 2/3 votes in the apps of M c0untd0wn, which has a weight of only 15%, it is time to continue watching the latest presentation of God's Menu on that channel, where Changbin and Seungmin appear on the thumbnail, thus contributing a further percentage.
4. Play on korean music sites such as Melon or Soribada, if you go to the StrayKids Twitter account you will see the links that will take you to the pages, by the way don't forget to register, this is very important.
5. Keep sharing Go 生's Mv's (I repeat just in case, God's Menu, Blueprint and Easy) to your contacts and on your social networks to keep earning v1ew$.
6. If you share an something from this album, or share l1nks, don't forget to tag the official StrayKids accounts
                                                                                                                                                       *And we can have a third Win for the boys, and Stay more than anyone knows they deserve it.*
                                                                                                                                                           If we don't win this week, where the Easy promotions start (which was already officially communicated in a Naver article and which is our last chance to win) at least we win more Stay's, more people who started following StrayKids official accounts. , God's Menu became Skz's fastest Mv to hit 50M, we broke new sales records with Go 生 and in itself this being their first full album is a great gift.
                                                                                                                                                                       *Stay, let's give everything this week. Fighting!*
(All of this information is based on Stay's tweets and comments here and also official information of Stray Kids)Thank you. 

Como Stay Latina vengo a decir que:

1. Continua escribiendo en los comentarios de mv's recetas, como te hiciste Stay, una lista de tus canciones fav de StrayKids, un ranking de Go生, etc para que se siga recomendando. God's Menu, Blueprint, Easy y tbm TOP si quieres ~inserta emoji de like~
2. Sigue haciendo Str3@m de los mv's para llegar a las siguientes cifras 
---> God's Menu 100M                                                                                                                      ---> Blueprint 10M
---> Easy 50M (es importante este MV porque la próxima semana comienza sus promociones) 
---> TOP 5M
Pero no solo de esos Mv's tbm apoya a Miroh y  My Pace a llegar a 100M de v1st@s.
3. Ahora que ganamos en 2/3 votaciones en las apps de M c0untd0wn que tiene un peso de tan solo 15%, toca seguir viendo la última presentación de God's Menu en dicho canal, donde Changbin y Seungmin aparecen en la portada, así aportamos un porcentaje más. 
4. Reproducir en los sitios musicales de Corea del Sur como Melon o Soribada, si vas a la cuenta de Twitter de StrayKids verás los links que te llevarán a las páginas, no olvides registrarte eso es muy importante. 
5. Sigue compartiendo los Mv's de Go生 (repito por se acaso, God's Menu, Blueprint y Easy) a tus contactos y en tus redes sociales para seguir ganando v1st@$. 
6. Si compartes algún suceso de este álbum o Mv, o compartes l1nks, no olvides etiquetar a las cuentas oficiales de StrayKids 

*Y así podremos tener un  tercer Win para los chicos, y Stay más que nadie sabe que se lo merecen.* Varias Stays han dicho que sí ganamos harían acciones amables como plantar árboles, donar dinero, etc en nombre de Stray Kids. 

Si no ganamos en esta semana donde las promociones de Easy comienzan (que ya fue comunicado oficialmente en un artículo de Naver y la cual es nuestra última oportunidad para ganar) al menos ganamos más Stay's, que más personas sigan a StrayKids en sus redes oficiales, God's Menu se convertio en el Mv de Skz más rápido en llegar a 50M, rompimos nuevos records de venta con Go生 y de por sí que este sea su primer álbum completo es un gran regalo. 

*Stay, demos todo en esta semana. Fighting!*

we can unite. This is our last chance to give the guys a win. This is a battle for our fandom, for our band. Yes, there are not many of us, but we are strong, we are persistent, we will not give up until the last moment. We will make them see themselves, we will make them stop throwing STRAY KIDS out of the show just like that. We'll get them to recognize our guys.
This is not a fandom war, this is a war for our honor. We don't lash out at others, we only waste our strength on our boys. We must, we simply must, thank them. We are the warmest fandom. We will prove that we are to be reckoned with. We can protect them and support them in difficult times. WE CAN DO IT!
let's choose a network where our support groups can join together
(bad eng sorry)
Ребята, у нас последний шанс получить хоть какую-то награду! Мы должны собраться снова. Мы будем спамить. Мы можем делать всё, чтобы нас заметили. Много комментируем под всеми фанкамами, по всеми выступлениями, песнями, клипами, под всем, что смотрим, длинными предложениями. Мы заставим увидеть себя! Мы можем это сделать. Это наш последний шанс. РЕБЯТА ПОЖАЛУЙСТА!  Собирайтесь в Support группах. Мы все должны объедениться между собой. В одной сети собрать все наши группы поддержки SKZ. Мы докажем, что достойны ребят. И не позволим корейцам выгонять их с шоу просто так. Ребята, это бой за нашу честь как fandom!
We are STAY! We make Stray Kids stay!

But i dont give up why? Cause i can make the other opportunities for skz. Not only winning in k-music show. And look how many record we broke STAY for this comeback? I knew youre sad, but remember skz always appreciate our effort! Now if you already gave up on streaming and voting, then we never make any difference. We will always make the same cycle and mistake. 
Let's cheer up and go str3aming and v0ting like crazy again until the whole world know there are a talented musician called Stray Kids. 
Just str3am the mv and their perfomances also use the free g3nie link and v0te them to give them many ads so it can help to promote them.

And when i watched that mv till the end (cuz the mv made me so curious back then), I was like ""yo that was lit af and energetic. Who th are they??"" And because of my curiosity, I searched the mv and found out that the title of the song is God's Menu, then watched it for the second time. My reaction was even crazier than before cuz like the whole mv was just, blows my mind ngl😂 Then I saw this dance practice video, watched it and I was like ""yoooo this choreography is goddamn energetic!"" And you know what, I've played the mv for like 10× times lol😂😂
And btw, I like the ""cooking like a chef I'm a 5 stars Michelin"" part and the deep voice Felix has (if I'm not mistaken about his name). Shout out to Stray Kids and team👏👏

1) Changbin starting the song
2) 0:25 - 0:36 Han Jisung >.<
3) 0:32 Seungmin bopping his head adds a bit of flex you know
4) 1:28 this step is so creative I love it
5) 1:39 that leg-throwing-part ugh hell yes
6) we've got two major things happening in this particular video: first at 2:15 with Felix's part that will forever be iconic!!!!! Second is at 2:16 with Hyunjin throwing his beanie away aka sexyness overload!!
7) 2:25 - 2:32 see what I meant by overload sexyness?? Ay ay ay...
8) 2:41 - 2:48 this part seems hard bc its fast as hell therefore it's so satisfying to watch bc we don't actually see how hard it is for them! 

Anyway I live for this! They always comeback harder and evolved, always with creative concepts and choreos.

Stay lagi sedih yah? Stay pada shock dan gak percaya kan?  Sama kok stay,  aku juga diposisi itu.
.
Sedih,  nangis,  dan kecewa tuh boleh kok stay tapi jangan sampai malas buat str*am,ng dan vote. 
.
Mari kita tengok kebelakang, kita sering mengalami seperti hari ini tapi kita semakin bangkit bukan.
Don't give up stay!
Masih ada esok,  lusa,  dan nanti.  
Pasti kita bisa ngasih 3rd win kok.  
Kita hanya perlu kompak dan jangan mudah terprovokasi sama haters yg mencoba memecah fokus tujuan kita.

@judethefourth336,"Thank you so much for uploading this now. We really needed it.

I am so sorry we couldnt give you a win until now. We really tried our best knowing you worked extremely hard and deserved a win because the album is the best of all your releases and you risked a lot deciding to change the title song last minute and I wish my words were better to express how grateful and proud I feel right now for you and for stays. We are really doing our best and trying to go further despite the difficulties. We are really pushing our limits and breaking our past records. I am so sorry that we couldnt win yesterday and today and I hope you can at least feel like you have done enough (BECAUSE YOU HAVE AND WE ARE SO PROUD OF YOU) with the achievements we have gained in these past despite not getting that win.

We still have a few possibilities, so I want to keep being positive and working for you. I hope that next time we can be able to make you win several times. You deserve so much more and I hope that someday we can give you back all the love, support, appreciation and inspiration you give us.

Dont feel discouraged or that you did not good enough. For us, you were the winners. You are always the winners by slowly improving yourselves and showing us the many sides of skz. I am so grateful for being a stay, so I hope you can feel that not even once we have been ashamed of you. Never. We are proud of you. Always. Please, dont overwork yourselves and STAYS I am also really proud of us. We did our best and we should keep this pace until the end of promotions and the next comebacks. This time we couldnt make it (for now) but if we keep working so hard as we did this time, I am sure next time we will top every chart and get many wins.

Cheer up, Stays and Stray Kids. Even in every moment of darkness, there's still some light, some hope and we should never lose our hope",1,2020-06-25T11:13:12Z
