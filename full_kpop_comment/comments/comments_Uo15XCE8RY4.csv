@sudeetiambale548,"This might be an unpopular opinion, but I think Seungmin stood out a lot in this video {to me}. He shone so much, especially in the part after the first chorus, where they were rapping, the ""BLAH BLAH"" part, and when Changbin was rapping, the way Seungmin lip-synced the rap got me. And his vocals are simply so melodious, it looks like he is not even trying but he sounds so good. I am a singer myself and have been studying music for the past 10 years, and I swear, his vocal parts are NOT easy. The way he sings it easily shows his professionalism as a singer. And, his dancing has come a long way. Especially now, in the LALALALALA era, the black outfit stage was owned by him. You can see the improvement here only. His visuals are so good, and his facial features are so pleasing. And due to his height, his and Hyunjin's proportions are the best in SKZ according to me {no hate for any other members}. He is a lowkey all-rounder: he raps, sings, dances, and has stage presence too. This is absolutely out of topic, but he is pretty intelligent too. I admire him for his awe-inspiring journey and love him for what he is. Again, I am just voicing my opinion and I love all the members. LOVE STRAYKIDS",2,2024-02-12T14:58:16Z

Precision, variety, and every member doing what they do best. Hyunjin being smooth, Channie being so happy, Han and his swag, etc. 
The domino line and 3 groups doing a similar echo earlier are just so clever and fit the song perfectly.

@andre7740,"I THINK SOMETHING! Is 2022 and i was watching domino and i was thinking ""why in the M/V the song stars with han rapping 1:18"" but When i go to the video of the dance practice (this video) I saw that the song started with a changbin rap, and i say ""tf is happening what's this?"" i go to the video original of domino and i see ""released: 2021"" And i come to this video and ""released: 2021"" after that i was like ""Is this a kind of deception or what?"" After i see the mins of duration of the mv: 1:37 (pls don't go at that part of this video) and i search the duration of this video: 3:19 (pls don't go at that part of this video)
and I came to the conclusion that they postponed the han rap, and started with a changbin rap to make the song last longer.

I wonder if they learn at least some of their songs this way and how many of them go off what is happening in the song to queue a move or if they count out the beats and measures,4,2022-06-08T03:25:40Z

Because of that ‘domino’ effect in some parts, if people doing dance covers of it is not really good dancers the whole performance will not be great or fun to watch. I’ve seen couple dance covers of this song and honestly I didn’t find them enjoyable to watch, most of them look unsync or messy because of poor execution of the steps.

@melodiouslyy,"omg this was just SO GOOD. the choreo for this one seems very difficult, but they all made it look so easy! here are some details/easter egg tidbits i caught while watching
0:04 changbin ""controlling"" felix + hyunjins movements with his hand which looks really cool
0:18 just chan vibing as he waits to come back in LOL
0:19 hyunjin leans back into changbin who hugs him from behind which was so cute <3
0:25 lee know and I.N share a high five 🥺
0:27 binnie puts his hand on hyunjin's shoulder
0:32 chan and seungmin fist bump which i think is quite purposeful since chan kind of ""transfers"" the vocal lines to seungmin, who sings next
1:03 HYUNJIN SLAPS CHAN'S BUTT BAHAHHAHA
1:21 smol lee know hop 
1:22 not so much an observation but wHY IS HANS ""BLAH BLAH"" SO ADDICTING BYE
1:24 idk if im the only one who didnt notice this the first watch around but they all hold up an 👌sign w their hands here
1:29 tiny steps 
2:04 ok who gave the choreographer the right to make this part SO INCREDIBLY SATISFYING.
2:15 I.N coming up with a smile hes SO CUTE 
2:16 chan shovelling
2:17 hyunjin slaps chans butt pt 2
2:39 i.n's little :O
2:45 sir i need you to get that tongue back in your mouth before i combust
2:53 hyunjin reaches up to adjust his hat. this isn't really an easter egg, mostly just him absolutely killing in that hat 
2:55 hans tiny shift backwards then a smol spin 
3:13 han almost loses balance AHHAAHA and he's grinning about it it's so cute that he's having the time of his life while dancing
3:19 i think it's hyunjin? who lets out the ""aHh"" in exhaustion since he's the one pulling off his hat? I'm not sure though
but yes these were all the ones that I noticed while watching! if there are any others do let me know, the amount of detail in this choreo is insane!! 
also omg this was just wayy too good. the choreo for this one seems very difficult, but they all made it look so easy! especially for hyunjin, his movements were so fluid and natural. my baby IN improved in dancing sm too 🥺 and minho got so many lines which i love <3

@pandiy9349,I love watching these dance practices slowed down because I miss so much at regular speed. Like when hyunjin smacks Chan’s behind at 1:03,1,2021-10-31T19:43:24Z
@assilane,"They are all so incredible in this I come back to it all the time and spend the entire video focusing on a different member. It's crazy to see how they improved a lot. IN is so good here, he has fun and it shows. Minho is amazing, kingdom really did him good I feel like he is much more confident since then. Changbin is really good too. He will never be main dancer but people tend to forget how all rounder he also is. Han is absolutely KILLING it here, this kids he's really training a lot these days. The others blend in so easily. It's such a tiring choreo but it looks so fun and cool and easy when they do it. 2:47 to 2:54 is my fav part ! Awesome.",10,2021-10-31T18:39:15Z

@musicforthesushirestraunt,"I.N should no more be criticised as the worst dancer in skz. His dancing skills has improved a lot faster than anyone there. His flows, flexibility , energy, facial expressions are really great especially at these parts 0:16 - 0:25 , 0:51 - 0:55 , 1:29 - 1:34 , 1:48 - 1:51 (that flow) ,  2:14  -  2:23 (his expressions here) , 2:42 - 2:55    and look at that move here 3:01 plus his energy from here is amazing 3:05. tbh he is good enough dancer to be a centre . People should also appreciate how his vocals have got stable too.

@yulianikong4088,"I believe this is probably the hardest choreography of skz. It's fast and it needs their maximum focus (especially on the domino effect part) or else it would be very messy. They would need some good stamina for this song. It's easy to see how Lee Know is so much in his element here, his detailed and precise moves is just incredible. I'm also so happy for IN improvement. He has sharper moves now, but I believe he needs to improve his flexibility and angles. In some parts, he looks stiff and needs to make his moves wider.",1104,2021-09-30T18:30:22Z

@levanter1219,"camera works usually make choreo more alive. but with this one, I think I prefer the full cam version like this. I dunno but it feels more wholesome. you can catch every details and killing parts without interruptions. and there are parts when they give different timings for the same movement to create the ""domino effect"" I guess 🤔 some of them are missing in their music show performance due to camera works. pretty understandable, the cameraman worked hard, it's just the choreo is much harder for them to work on 😭",0,2021-09-28T09:08:00Z

@zzzy98.7,"I don’t know if anyone said this or maybe i’m wrong but i cathed some parts in the choreo wich i’ve seen in other dance practice videos. If this is true i think that is really cool and it makes it more fun to watch cause you see some moves you’ve already seen. This is really one of the best choreos of Stray Kids in my opinion and from start to end their energy never decrease. I love how each member has a lot of time to shine in the song and in the dance. Personally i think this song and dance has some really strong title track vibe but i think because the dance is so hard and the moves are big it looks like it is harder to sing it live so maybe thats why they didnt choose this as title track but either way both Thunderous and Domino is 1000% fire. Actually the whole album is fire. I’ve been a stay for more than 2 years now and i never came across to a bad Stray Kids song( all thanks to 3racha). It just keeps getting better and better. I feel really proud to see them getting the attention and love they always deserved.  I am so lucky that i found them, they helped me a lot throughout a lot of difficult time in my life. Thanks to them i am now in my dream university cause they thaught me to never give up on my dreams. I hope they know how much they mean to Stays. I am so glad i chose to join this family.",34,2021-09-26T23:33:48Z

And this choreo is just...oof, entertained by every second, some moves are so dynamic - I love the blocking with each member ""falling"" on the main ""Domino"" hook and then the way the subsequent moves progress through the group...like that is not easily done.

Also I have to say that this choreo is so Lee Know style. Not saying that others is bad though, coz honestly they're all so good and so synchronized with such fast paced choreo. But there's something that makes Lee Know dance so satisfying to watch. I love how he put some tiny details which make the dance moves even better. For example 01:17, he is the only one who have that kind of almost falling move, hence it connect with the next move better (I don't really know how to describe it, hopefully it's at least understandable). 01:28, it's a little bit similar to krumping where he's using chest and shoulder instead of only arms.",9,2021-09-25T08:29:36Z

They were keeping this little jewel tucked away so Stay did not spontaneously combust at one time. You know a dancer is bomb when the hat goes in front of their eyes and they never miss a beat.

Picasso'nun yıllar boyunca uğraştığı bir eser. Yunan heykeli gibi. Bazenleri kırılgan bir bebek, bazen aklını başından alacak kadar ateşli, çoğu zaman sexy, erkek arkadaşın  olmasını isteyecek kadar cazibeliler, bazen seni çıkmaza sokacak kadar güçlü bir bad boylar. Straykids bu işte. Seni bir dipsiz kuyu gibi içine çeker ve bir daha salmaz. Ama o çukurda olmaktan hoşnut olursun ve çıkmak istemezsin.

Between the level of energy and the density of the choreography, that must take some real stamina and also focus. I continue to be impressed by these gentlemen. The fact that they’re not just singers who can dance a bit—nah, they really go in on BOTH—and the fact that they ALSO are on the writing and choreographing sections of the process rather than only performing material written or choreographed by others. 

Those are four different fields all on their own (dancing, singing [& rapping, which is really its own skill!], song writing, choreography), not counting the sub-skills needed in each. 

IM-PRES-SIVE!

1:04 - 1:10 - Just a moment of appreciation for Seungmin center
1:04 - 1:10 - The way Changbin does this part *WHEW*

2:05 - THIS ARE WE FUCKING KIDDING??
2:14 - Jisung's facial expressions
2:19 - I saw that tongue, Yang Jeongin

@GraeSloane,"So this is an absolutely insanely good and difficult choreo! - I should know, I've been watching it on a loop since it was posted lol

Like not only the whole choreo (the formations and images) is crazy but each individual member's choreo is super hard and insanely detailed and precise and they just completely killed it!!! 

Jeongin made incredible progress in dancing since he started working out, so did Seungmin thanks to his diligence with practice. 
The facial expressions, especially Chan, Changbin, Felix and Jeongin are amazing. 
Their energy is through the roof, all of them! 
The song is bangers (but we already knew that) 
They managed to do the domino effect (dance in canon - dance the same moves but one by one at different times) and still be perfectly syncronized for the other parts of the choreo 

And I am just in awe of all there is to unpack in this (Chan mopping the floor and making way for Felix's ""DAN DAN DAN DAN""s, Felix's beanie covering his eyes while he just keeps on dancing, Hyunjin making Changbin give him a back hug on the side while they wait their turn with Chan next to them dancing like a worm, the apparent chaos when they're swinging precariously on one foot at the end, even the fact that... this is the last Dance Practice with Hyunjin's long hair T.T _ a perfect video all around)

@pratisthalama4656,"Usually in groups, you’d expect one or two members to be not quite at the level as the others, but Stray Kids genuinely astounds me because all of their dancing is at an extremely high standard to the point that it actually takes a close analysis and research to find out who the ‘assigned’ dancers are. And this also applies for their singing and rapping skills as well.  Some seem to be under the impression that good vocals = the ability to reach high notes, and although skz certainly has members able to sing those notes, good vocals is more about showcasing incredibly stable and clear vocals which ALL members of skz do fantastically. I don’t need to touch on the rapping, we’ve all seen every member  at some point prove that they are than capable in spitting out some bars.

Long story short, skz is incredible, this video is just another piece of evidence to support that.",124,2021-09-24T11:43:14Z

@Librarian2406,"The choreo is not only pleasing and stunning to look at, but the depictions are spot on, I hv seen this alot in skz choreography that the choreo is ""smart"" and ""creative"" and apart from that the intricacies at certain points in the choreo is remarkable, and the contrast between the intricate and loud over the top choreo at other parts, is perfectly balanced! And after all of this, their execution of moves is getting better and better every comeback,  jeongin specifically has TREMENDOUSLY improved his dancing, and I hv always admired his stage precense anyway. Apart  from this I love the fact that the choreos are a good balance of hard and fluid. This gives a lot of variety and fun to the chireo. I also think their controll and energy is very spot on, as in its neither too much nor too less, making it look seemeless, and effortless, along with not looking lousy. This is hard to pull off!

@minmin-kr4hw,honestly I feel like vocalracha has really improved a lot these days. Like really from working on their vocals to fit in skz's usual style to really working hard on their dancing to make their choreos looks really balanced and energetic all the way (especially mentioning them because like a few years back I did see how they were slightly lacking compared to the energy levels of the rest) and seriously I'm so proud of them for working so hard on these little things because its really showing. And the other members too since we've repeatedly seen them helping the two out when learning or remembering choreos. Really cant wait to see how much more skz grow and compliment each other in the future <33,0,2021-09-24T11:24:09Z
