@sonalisamal2009,"I love how everyone is talking about Jun here. In the main MV, everyone was talking about Vernon's one line where did very well. This comment section proves yet again how nobody gets left out or unnoticed in Seventeen. In some songs you might see more lines of some members, in other songs you'd see more lines of some other members, so it's balanced. There are 13 members and they have songs that are maximum of 4-5 minutes length, so I feel Seventeen has a very fair distribution. If a member has lesser lines in a particular song, they make sure that member either has a very catchy line, or atleast something that would make him stand out.. I mean despite having so many members, we can still talk about everyone. I love how Carats talk about everyone, and don't just focus on one person. I mean ofc in some particular videos, you'll see more comments for some members, and in other videos, you'll see more comments for someone else. So it's pretty balanced. It's not like people just keep talking about one member everywhere, which makes me feel all  13 of them get their fair share of love and attention. ❤❤❤",0,2023-10-18T04:44:15Z

 face the sun album is just around the corner, I'm really looking forward to see if pledis x hybe will provide him more expose, because if not, they're sleeping on art and talent once again",1,2022-05-23T08:18:20Z

@hoeshi4151,"Anyone is the long lost son of Fear! I just realized it now, coz they got this same vibe, that kinda mysterious sound and about relationships and what's more interesting here is that they got the same vibe but the message is very opposite to each other like Fear's message is about pushing someone away because of the feel of being toxic which will become a poisonous love but Anyone is about keeping your other half and kinda like we have this own world and we make our own rules here smth like that anyways I really love Anyone's choreography

@seventeenoctobercomeback1544,"RTL choreo is good but Anyone's much much much better. This choreo is 100% svt style, while RTL is half svt & half not them (even cheol said it & fyi, a new choreographer participated so that explains the half being not them) Svt choreo has so many details so u can really tell that THIS IS SEVENTEEN!!! I hope Pledis will stick to Team SAME as choreographers since theyre the one who knows Seventeen's style & what theyre capable of, theyve been with them since 2015. Same with producers, Woozi, Bumzu & Prismfilter are enough. We all made it this far bc of these amazing ppl ^^",3,2021-07-18T03:52:35Z

@castellamanda23,"My personal favorite moments
:21 Hoshi's choreography is so mesmerizing
:31 the changing levels with the head tilt to the side on the beat is so satisfying to watch
:48 The first choreo when the beat hits and then their fingers run up their arms gives me goosebumps!
:53 DK's part where they jump out and then in!!! The sound of the shoes hitting is so clean yet soft. I don't know why, but it sounds different than the normal sound of shoes hitting the floor.
1:12 The way Woozi is the only member to spin off stage😂
1:12 Also Jun sliding on the floor to get off 
1:23 Jeonghan's part!! Short, but so unique. Also the lyrics are ""we are together"", which go with the choreo of being connected/being together.
1:31 Dino's absolute ferocity. He truly throws his all into performing!
1:45 Jun's hands! So beautiful! ALSO HIS VOCALS!
2:48 I loved the rotating hands all throughout the choreo, but this contagion is another level!!! 
Also can we appreciate everyone's vocals in this song especially Hao, Jun, and Vernon, and finally Jeonghan and then S. Coups ending this beautiful masterpiece. Love this song and choreo!!!

@therevelers6581,"I've watched this video at least 30 times, so here's a guide to my favorite moment(s) of each member:

*Dino:* His head and torso work at 1:49 to 1:55 is !!!  And all of detail he manages at 0:47 to 0:53.  Future of kpop!!

*Woozi:*  Honestly the whole entire video he's on fire but look at his vibe at 0:25 through his solo and then watch him dancing like he's six feet tall at 2:32 to 2:45 (Check out his feet!)

*Joshua:*  Even though he's in the back, look  at 2:09, I've watched that a billion times. 

*Jeonghan:*  The emotion / drama he captures from 0:13 to 0:27 he has absolutely no right. 

*Jun:*  0:23 to 0:47 he is USING those proportions, the flow, the shapes he's making ahhhh!!!

*Minghao:*  please look at his style choices at 1:49 to 2:00 I'm gonna #@#*)((

*Vernon:*  king of underrated dance skills how do I pick?  His flow at 0:18 to 0:30??  1:47 through his lines?? the entire first chorus???  

*DK:*  The ""hand in pocket"" ease he's got for the song like at 1:02 is *chef kiss*  His hand and finger movements at 2:18 (lol) through 2:23, too.  I am literally in LOVE. 

*Hoshi:* I promised myself I wouldn't just pick their main parts but his Adonis statuesque perfect at 0:21 to 0:30 is full *heart-eyes* and then at 1:41 to 1:45 (legs!) 

*Mingyu:*  I know this sounds weird but when he's rejoining the dance at 1:30 to when he exits again at 1:40. . . that's hot.  Also the quick transition he does at 0:52

*Wonwoo:*  I am not a dancer so I don't know how to describe this but he moves like a wheel it's so satisfying please look at 0:47 to 0:53 and bonus for his move at 2:06

*S. Coups:*  Take a quick peek of him at the back at 0:15 if you want to die tonight.  Then at 1:31 his little fake out and finally 2:07 (he's left of center behind Woozi) and uh, wowowoWOWOWO

*Seungkwan:*  I need you all to please watch my boy starting at 0:18 to 0:35 the ELEGANCE the EASE the **NECK SNAP** jisoajdifewaj 

Anyway:  alternate title for this is ""Seventeen showing off their individual styles while being insanely in-sync.""",6,2021-07-16T19:32:21Z

@dindaseptiara5393,"objectively speaking, this choreo dance doesn't look as great as usual seventeen. i mean, they're synchronizing and the dance are great, but some of members sometimes too fast or too late (and they seems to abruptly chasing right tempo). if you only focus on the foot stomping, then they're harmonious, but if you focus to the movement as well, you can see where i came from. it's because seventeen has set the bar too high so every time i got chance to really analize their performance, i can't help but really put concern to every parts. you can compare this with their performance here https://youtu.be/-wthdu2V0Xg. that 'anyone' performance is 5x better imo. good thing that came with this choreo practice is i can focus with every member and see their surplus and lacking part of each them;

0:23 1:18 soonyoung ; dance sensually. he manages to make every moves he does look sexy as if he speaks and tells something through a performance. 'anyone' has complex movements that requires a good eye-hand coordination and he can pull it without sweating it too much

0:33 2:01 jihoon ; smooth moves. you would understand why jeonghan says he looks like worm when he dances. he is. you ever see a worm moves, right? the joints in jihoon's body don't look like they're exist because he's so flexible. look at how he makes 360 dance rotation and facing toward us, that part is really satisfying!

0:49 1:41 wonwoo ; harsh style. he doesn't have much to put in details--in fact, he's lacking here along with the expression. the positive part is, he can executed the major moves really clean. if you went to his predebut years, you'd be surprised how much he has developed

0:51 2:47 mingyu ; mediocre. if you put him in order of dancing, he's maybe the 7th or 8th. he's not really good (in seventeen) in term of dancing. kinda lack power from the rest of members, but surprisingly he's excellent in those arm movement and synchronize it with his expression. if you don't believe me just go to the timestamp

0:56 2:19 seokmin ; the underappreciated one, lol. i don't get why even carats don't see his ability in dancing is somewhat being neglected. i'm not saying this because he's my bias but lets be frank, if you have to put them in order for dancing, he's atleast the top five--in seventeen. and don't you find the thigh tick 0:57 here excellent

1:06 2:08 seungkwan ; effeminate. don't take the word wrong way, its an expression to say that his dancing somehow inserted an feminity and soft aura. not only in this choreo, but in the other practice videos as well. he could pull 'anyone' which is so 'masculine' but still doesn't lose his charm in it. put more focus on his legs movement, moreover his calves

1:34 2:12 2:34 vernon ; the aloof kid. he exuded too much energy so even if he's dancing in a group, you can feel him trying to dominate the stage. i kept playing 2:36 to make sure but he indeed losing tempo from the rest members here

1:35 chan ; king of expression. he's the winner in term of expression in performances. focus on his gesture of showing neck and collarbone. wherever he is located, he never forget to gaze the audiences. he makes a great dancer, because dancing isn't only about clean moves, but how you make your audiences also enjoy the performance

1:43 2:33 junhwi ; sharp moves. he executed major moves beautifully. but in this 'anyone' performance, to be exact, he can't surpass himself if you compare it to their '247' choreo practice. junhwi's clean movements looks much more beautiful there

2:33 myungho ; the textbook performer. focus at his torso movement here 2:35. i think he might be one of the members who's fast in learning new choreo, albeit he's in performance team, though

0:17 2:40 jisoo ; center fairy. he can easily steal attention whenever he's being put in center. however he doesn't shine much if he's in the back or side wings of stage

1:23 2:37 jeonghan ; rest asap guy. his dancing don't seem too appealing, but if he learns more, he has a possibility to surpass myungho. once when seventeen just debuted, he ever said that, he was always the last in mastering new choreo because he's not really good remembering moves, but for someone who's not good in it, he has potential

1:08 seungcheol ; (???) i can't say much because he doesn't appear much with moves in this choreo but being an ending fairy",0,2021-07-16T07:09:26Z

@vindicatedtruth,"You know how the calibre of a professional vocalist is about hitting the precise notes with accuracy? It's the same with SEVENTEEN when it comes to their dance. Every angle of their arms, every toss of their head, every stamp of their feet, every twist of their torso are all so precise and SO clean that it's almost eerie how meticulous each detail of choreography is.

Take note that they have 13 members, which means a single movement out of place by any member would've stood out and not in a good way. It's such an admirable mark of their dedication to their craft that they honed every single movement to be as close to perfect as possible.

I truly have yet to see any other artist perform at their level. They really are of a different calibre.",183,2021-07-16T05:38:08Z

@hamstercarat3396,I love every part of the choreo but my most favourite part of this choreo is the one during cheol part where other members kinda have the walking to the side ( from 1:05 to 1:10 )and the one where they have major big hand movement and then connected to torso and lower body then proceed smoothly to the leg ( 0:57 - 1:00 and 2:42 - 2:45 ). That was hella smooth!!!,0,2021-07-16T04:56:48Z

@bjt7117,"They're so clean. I'm always impressed by SEVENTEEN's ability to meet each other's power, agility, grace, and sharpness, to make one uniform picture.. even though they all have different body types and dance styles. The hard work and hours of practice is evident. I also love their seamless transitions as they spotlight each member during their solo lines, and the smooth blocking changes are breathtaking. The part where Minghao is singing while other members circle around him hadn't stood out to me until watching this practice; watching head on as they start that part off-center, but then cleanly gravitate toward center stage as a unit WHILE ORBITING MINGHAO, and then snap their arms out in a single line......Yall i could watch SVT dance all day oh my god.

@fructidorxx,세븐틴은 정말 다인원 그룹으로 활동하면서 군무 짜고 동선 활용하는 데 도가 텄음… 춤구멍이 없기도 하고 멤버마다 소위 쪼가 없고 전체 그림을 항상 생각해서 무엇 하나 거슬리지 않고 조화로움. 레투럽 안무가 노래에 담아내고자 했던 메시지를 전달하는 데 충실했다면 애니원은 그간 세븐틴이 보여줬고 세븐틴이 잘하던 파워풀한 군무여서 너무 좋다.,0,2021-07-15T15:07:46Z
