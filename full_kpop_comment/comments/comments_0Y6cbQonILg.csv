@user-qp3xx4mw1e,"가장 편한 방식이 아닌 더 나은 사람이 될 수 있는 방식으로 살아간다는 것 자체가 엄청난 사랑이다
스스로를 사랑하지 못하는 사람들은 변하지 않아 편하게 살고 싶어서 그저 회피하기 바쁨
나는 그냥 그게 바로 마크가 자신을 사랑하는 방식이라고 생각해
충분한 사랑을 위한 과정일 뿐이지
이미 스스로에게도 좋은 사람일지도 몰라",3,2025-02-28T21:16:10Z

@of_us_,"너는 평범해
그 전에 지내던 사람도 이렇게 지내왔을거고

... 이러는데 이마크 삶은 진짜 상위 몇퍼만 살것같다
두 그룹에 솔로,음악작업까지 준비하는데..
그럼에도 본인의지와 열정 목표를 향한 끝없는 나아감이 원동력이 난 팬이지만서도 한 인간으로도 감탄과 존경이 언제나 함께함 ㅠ
그러면서 애가 번아웃이 왔었을텐데 또 올수도 있을텐데 걱정과 우려도 항상 맘속에 존재하고...

자기 기준이 높아서 더 힘든 고생을 하겠지만 그만큼 마크의 성장도 끝없을듯 (지금까지도 끝없는 성장을 하고도 남았지만..)
마크한텐 진짜 배울점이 차고차고 넘친다 ㅜ 나도 열심히 살게

I haven’t heard SM artists talking this freely about topics like this and I’m not sure if it’s because he’s speaking all English but I loved the honesty and I look up to mark so much more after seeing this.

@heran6899,"좋은 영상이네요. 아티스트가 한 곡을 만들면서 자신의 내적 동기를 설명해주는 거 참 좋아요.

남들이 나를 어떻게 보느냐 보다는 내가 나를 보는 시선이 더 우리 마음을 무겁게 할 수도, 가볍게 할 수도 있다는 점을 잘 말해주고 있네요.

마크는 자기와의 대화를 지속적으로 하고 있기 때문에 그게 창작의 에너지 가 될 것 같아요. 저는 클래식 애호가이지만 가끔씩 독백을 털너놓는 듯한 랩가사를 듣는 게 좋더군요.

@Lonnloven,"Mark, if you ever read this comment, thank you for being brave and sharing so much of your life and like…just telling it like it is. Thank you for speaking openly about mental health, insecurities, feelings of not being enough, but also about ambitions, art, creativity, aspirations and love. All of what you talk about here came across to me while listening to ""Child"" and watching the MV, but you explain yourself and your creative process really well. 

In a way, watching this video, at moments I kind of felt like I was watching my younger self, as if I was seeing myself from another point of view. I'm almost twice your age, and while my life didn't look in the least like yours, I also had a turbulent adolescence. To the world outside, I was this perfect kid: quiet, hardworking, reliable, humble. On the inside though, I was a power keg about to explode, angry ALL the time, frustrated, sad, depressed, at times even suicidal (I'm not anymore, don't worry). I'd sit in school like a model student, pretend to be perfect and accept my teachers' praise, then I'd take the long way home and break or vandalise something somewhere where no one would realise that it was me. 

It took me a long time to unlearn the toxic way that was me hiding my true self from the rest of the world, to realise that it was ok not to be perfect, to not to be the ace all the time. To just be me. I hope you won't feel afraid of growing older, because trust me, a lot of things actually get WAY easier when you gain perspective and learn and grow. As you talked about in this video, I also used to worry constantly about who I was in the eyes of others during my teens, my 20's and a fair bit into my 30's, but somewhere along the line, I just stopped worrying and accepted myself as I am. 

You're still young, and clearly a lot wiser than you may think. Restless souls like us usually end up using creative expression as a way to navigate our complicated feelings and doubts. You found music as an outlet, I found writing. Unlike you, I'm not a particularly ambitious person – I'm amazed by your accomplishments at such a young age btw – but I still need to keep writing or else my brain just…becomes weird. 

As a final thought, while you probably realise this yourself already, don't be afraid to keep some of you to yourself. Not everything needs to be shared with fans or become content. Make sure to keep some of your most valuable things to yourself and share with the ones you love. You seem very happy lately, so hopefully you get to fullfil all those dreams of yours and share them with someone. Thank you for giving your fans a lot of love and inspiration, and take care of yourself! And remember that you are enough. 💜",4,2023-03-02T13:14:34Z

Maybe I'm still a child or maybe I'm an adult who wants to be a child. But whichever I am, I will grow more and experience and learn from a various world. 
I hope this song that Mark gave me as a gift is the beginning. 
Mark I know is someone who moves towards dreams really fast and with a pretty aggressive attitude. sometimes I think you might be lonely. however, Don't forget that I'm always on your side when you feel lonely. 
You said you were an ordinary child, but at least to me you are the most special child in the world.

@pizzaforme2006,"seems a bit late to say something but i came across this as I’m having one of my nightmares and it really comforted me so thank you Mark :) Thank you for giving us a gift with a great message! 

I don’t speak for everyone but i guess some of us feel like a child inside and are trying our best to feel loved by others. We ask ourselves countless of questions like what we can do better or am I even doing enough. and without realising it, we beat ourselves up, sometimes even for things we can’t control. We feel stuck. What we failed to realise, is that we need to let go of these things, accept it the way it is, and start on our own journey with just one person and thats you.

It’s never too late to start healing from your wounds. There is no such thing as you are taking too long. Just take as much time as you need for yourself, be nicer to yourself and search for opportunities to grow. Always acknowledge how far you have come and be proud of yourself. Even getting through another day is a great achievement. I hope all you can embark on your journey towards healing ❤

and for Mark, if you’re seeing this which I highly doubt so but incase, i just would like to say that you are doing so so well right now. We all couldn’t be any more prouder. Your path has definitely not been easy and you had to make sacrifices but we are super thankful for the person you are today. In our eyes, you are the most hardworking, talented and selfless person. And we all look up to you! Not just your skills but also  you as a person, your relationship with yourself and those around you, including your fans. And for that, we are all proud of having you as our artist/idol and I hope you are proud of yourself too ❤",0,2023-02-16T20:29:43Z

I'm older than you, that's for sure, but damnit, you make me want to continue what I like to do; I'm a writer, I can write to your song and it gives me ideas. You, my dear, are my bias; the one who got me into NCT in the first place, and that's a good way to tell that someone is creative if you are a bias of theirs.

You are a talented young man and like how Taemin has said, you're a genius. In your field of rapping, singing, the way you speak, and the way you present yourself; you're a gorgeous, glorious human, Mark. We love you and hope you're happy for your entire lifetime. You deserve the world and more. Thank you, for being your goofy self, and making us feel like we're watching our own child grow up; happy and healthy. I don't have a kid and I don't think I will have one but if I did have a child, I'd hope they would be as talented as you are and happy as well.",3,2023-02-10T22:55:36Z

Everything he said made me think abt my adolescence and how I should be enjoying it while I have the chace. Because it’s really important that you experience that part in your life and mark explained his thoughts very well. It makes me sad that he worked so hard at such a young age bc he didn’t have time to experience his adolescence until after. But he’s so passionate abt it his work and I respect that. I was sobbing listening to his words and I feel more encouraged and thankful for him. He’s such an amazing human being. 🫶🏼🫶🏼,1,2023-02-10T08:41:54Z

dear Mark, 

may your nights always be peaceful. in our eyes, you are a star that shines so brightly out of the midnight sky. we may not always understand you but we'll always be here for you and with you.

child is such a beautiful song. it reached the depths of my heart and genuinely resonated to the core of my soul. honestly, i relate to child so much, your thought processes and your musings about life in general. it feels such an honor to listen to your song and experience your perspectives and sentiments. you inspire me so much as a person and you will always will. you inspired me to write and you inspired me to keep on living. 

keep on dreaming, keep on singing, keep on rapping, keep on writing, keep on being the amazing and talented person that you are! there is so much to say but words could only convey little of how much of a great person you are. I hope this piece of writing may find you somehow or someway when the weight of the world becomes too apparent for you to hold.

—at heart, we'll always be a child inside. so sometimes it's okay to let it all out. let's try to love ourselves no matter how little it can be. it's a lonely life but at least let's walk with it together ♡ ♡

I hope to hear more of your songs and read more of your writings mark! 

with love,

We only probably see a small bit of who you really are. But the your authenticity cuts through and reaches us. There may be times u have to uphold an image. But in your spontaneous moments, we see glimpses of bits and pieces of u. I LOVE all of them.",1,2022-10-05T04:17:11Z

@kuj9794,"15 minutes have passed so quickly... this is how amazing Mark is! You don't even realize how much time passed when you listen to him and to his inner thoughts. His words made me think a bit dipper about myself, knowing that I'm at that age where I live in the world he talked about. It's fascinating how he can open his heart and talke about his feelings just like that, knowing that anyone can see what's inside him. He has a lot of strength to do so! I really appreciate him and I'm happy he knows how many related to him when he released this song. Actually this is my favorite solo this year, no-one could top this and I think it won't happen very soon. I am happy and grateful for everything Mark did, ever, but especially for this song and all the videos related to it! Just like now, I'll come back again and again to listen to him, cause it really helps me think about myself again in a different way, which is something I rarely do. Thank you, Mark, for everything! You are an amazing person and even if there are parts you don't like about yourself (we all kinda have them), there's this good thing: you always try to improve and to become a better version of yourself. And this is what matters after all. These are some words I should thell myself, too.
I love you, Mark, and I hope you will have a bright future and I hope you'll get to love yourself more! You are amazing! 
20 sept 2022
P.S. I wrote this comment as a journal page for myself, so when I come back to this song I will see my old self thoughts and I'll see how far I came to be. To my future self: I hope you improved a lot and I hope you are a better person than myself. I hope you love yourself more, I hope you got to control your inner rebellious child, and I hope you reached to a better life. I hope you live a beautiful and happy life and I hope you will see a progress from today till the day you'll be back here again. Don't read the comments under this song too often, so you'll have time to change and improve. Take care of you!",4,2022-09-20T09:34:13Z

@applerose3102,"Aside from being HANDSOME & TALENTED, ""PASSIONATE"", ""HARDWORKING"", ""GODFEARING"" and most of all ""GENUINE"" are the words we could always attribute to Mark  because he has them all obviously. And these are some of the primary reasons why I chose him as my ultimate bias ever since SM Rookies era. Finding a guy like him is truly one in a million. True enough that those who easily laughs a lot are the ones who hides the deepest worries or problems, and you can see it in Mark (I can relate too.huhu). I'm so thankful how he genuinely opened up a part of his thoughts and emotions through this interview and through his song ""Child"". It speaks volumes about how great of a man he is. 

To Mark, you are a human. You have thoughts and emotions, and you are free to have them and deal with them however you want. Just know that Markfs are always here for you to show great support, to give you strength and motivation, and most of all to make you happy.  For all that you are and for all that you do, I sincerely THANK YOU from the innermost core of my heart! <3",3,2022-03-30T17:31:45Z

I all the time wished u all the best but now i know what u really need and i really want u more than all the best, first of all pls pls know and appreciate yourself. It’s so sad people made u think of yourself as someone different but in a way u think of yourself every night scary and heavy thoughts. U r different, that’s true. But mark, this is exactly the reason u r my bias. This is the reason why i really think of u every day for almost five years. U r not someone. U r not that someone the world made u thinking about yourself u r, you are someone that made others from all over the world experience their life smartly and sensitively to others and fully and with passion and with values and with an endless inspiration. Yeah, THANKS TO YOU. Are there more people in this world that can make others feel and live like that? Only the special ones, and also, never in the same way. U r unique. U r different. But u r different in a way that im grateful for that every day in my life, every moment i think of u, bcs this is what makes our world the more beautiful, the much more better world, the safer world, the amazing, full of passion! Full of lessons world. Because of these different people. U r one of them. For me u r the first one on my list of inspirational people, thanks to your difference. This is literally the thing that makes u almost perfect. Almost bcs i see how many questions u have about yourself, but actually isnt it what makes u even more beautiful? That u care about being better? Care about being the best u r? Isnt it amazing in your eyes? U wanna improve yourself, all u need to do is to say wow, im amazing. Im proud of myself for that. There are people in this world that have totally different thoughts in their mind. Aren’t u thankful for being that different guy? Ofc u go through super hard things bcs of that difference, values, QUALITIES… but at the end of the day, your conscience, your heart is the place u wanna be, your believes, your differences. This is what actually makes u a better person than all the “regular”, “normal” ones. This is the price u pay for being a good person, that different one… it’s totally hard, but this is what makes u be that special guy that stays on the other good people’s minds. Bcs u r different we notice u. We love and proud and happy for your being bcs of this difference, this is the inspiration, this is the uniqueness, all the qualities of yourself.

I also very conscious of what people thought about me before, but as i got older i didn't really care because the things that matters is what i know about myself..

@성연우-h7f,"아침이 되고 해가 뜨면
카메라 앞에서, 우리들 곁에서
항상 좋은 모습을 보여주려 
웃으며 노력하는 너의 모습
밤이 오고 해가 지면
카메라 뒤, 우리가 사라진
오로지 마크의 시간 속에
혼자가 된 너는
널 향한 수많은 질문들
널 옥죄오던 혼란, 고뇌에 빠져
모두가 잠들 때 마크는 잠들지 못하고
혼자 악몽과 싸우고 있었구나
그렇게 성장통 같은 밤을 이겨내며 
다시 해가 뜨고 아침이 오면 
우리에게 어김없이 나타나줬구나
너가 어떤 밤을 보냈는지도 모르고
마크에게 어떤 악몽이 있었는지도 모르고
난 마크의 해가 뜬 순간들만 알아줬구나",2,2022-02-21T17:38:56Z
@성연우-h7f,"너에게 짊어진 책임감이 얼마나 무거웠을까 
아직 너무 어린 마크에게 붙여진 
수많은 수식어들이 부담이 됐구나
너의 수많은 자아에 대한 혼란들이 
널 옥죄었고 방황하게 만들었어
그런 순간들이 오면 
그 자아를 생기게 한 사회와 
남이 되고 싶었던 순간이 있었구나
사회에 틀에 벗어나 자유로워지고 싶었구나

마크야 그래서 지금 너의 근황은 어때?
이제는 좀 뒤를 돌아볼 수 있게 됐어?
아니면 여전히 달리고 있을까?
여전히 달리고 있다 해도 내가 같이 뛰어줄게
공감해주고 알아줄게 
함께 할게",2,2022-02-21T17:30:54Z
@성연우-h7f,"항상 겸허히 자신을 돌이켜 보고 바라보는 
우리 마크를 어떻게 안사랑하겠어
난 항상 많은 사람들이 마크를 좀 더 알아주고
사랑해줬으면 좋겠다고 생각했어
충분히 그럴 만한 가치가 있는 너니까
좀 더 많은 사랑을 받길 원했어
근데 이젠 아니야
누구보다 너 자신이 너에게 주는 사랑에 넘쳐 
내가 주는 사랑보다 더 크길 바래
사랑해 이마크",3,2022-02-21T17:28:02Z

Some of us can’t be that brave and strong, but we really see inspiration in you. Keep up climbing that latter of life, I hope someday you can look back and think: “it was all worth it”.

@Buruuberii91,"""People are so lonely. People CAN be so lonely. And at the end it's just them wanting help."" This, and the words he talks about after that really struck me. Someone who feels lonely very often and has been feeling kind of like an outsider all her life, these words made me nearly tear up but also a little bit lighter. Little bit like ""huh, someone else is thinking the same way. I guess I'm not so alone after all."" 

Mark has such a beautiful and insightful mind, I have always admired that about him. I hope he always will stay curious and excited about life, even in the middle of stressful schedules and all else life brings. ♡

@mmmk6793,"Mark is incredibly driven, thats such an admirable trait. But also, for whatever reason, he feels like he absolutely cannot fail and so he works so hard and does what he has to do to succeed and is incredibly consistent. On stage, he never gives less than 100%, no matter how many stages or how many units had performed before, he pulls through and delivers everytime. No doubt he's exhausted but he doesn't faulter; unfortunately this has the adverse effect of making his peers see him as some who can take ridiculous amounts of pressure no question, so maybe he can't be honest abt how he feels and they would not know to ask about the pressure of being perfect, the center of a brand essentially. It may even make them envy him, all the while he is buckling undert the pressure.",0,2022-02-18T21:21:14Z

Would love to know where he was going when he was telling child Mark that he's a normal person. As a fellow introvert, I think about those a lot too, and it transients through different age groups. It's important to give ourselves due credit just before we start thrashing ourselves. That's the first step to truly loving yourself. Mark is definitely mature beyond his age and I hope he gives himself a break from the responsibilities from time to time for some self care.",0,2022-02-18T20:01:03Z

1)Love yourself
2) Be yourself not an facade version 
3) Freely express yourself

@iana9055,"Mark, you are such a nice guy to me and I'll never get tired of telling you that. You deserve to know that, to be reminded of it. Thank you for being vulnerable and genuine to us. It's this kind of love and healthy relationship that fills my heart -- it makes me see the beauty of life and of people. I've met you in the most perfect time of my life and now that I think of it I couldn't even imagine the life where I don't know a Mark Lee. You are THAT person in my life now. I'm so grateful I get to share moments with you, to walk by each other in our own journey and to cheer for each other in our own battles. 


You've always been so busy with things so I truly  hope you get to slow down at times too. Just make time and peace with yourself. 


I will always be proud of you and I hope you are proud of yourself too! Here's to the life that we are living 🥂

@Light-bu8yn,I hope Mark and other members would get the freedom they deserve. Hope the company won't push them to depend on the world's validation all the time. People will always be opinionated no matter what idols do. So I sincerely want them to be free from all these toxicity and high demands of the world. Hope they can be more free to be themselves and be genuinely happy💚,0,2022-02-17T16:31:18Z

@LeeM4rk7,すぐに寝れるタイプじゃなくて、いろんな事考えてたら結構時間たってたなってことあったりするから、それも一種の悪夢って言ってるの凄くわかる。私は自分のことが一番わからないから、自分を客観視することが得意なの凄いなって思う。でもそんな面を持ちつつも、一方で他人からの目が気になるっていえるのは、本当に自分を客観視できてるから言えることなのかなって思う。私なんか自分のことわからないし客観的に見れないし人の目しか気にしてないからほんとやばい笑でも、「自分は平凡だ」って言った後にネガティブにならないように戻そうとしてたのは自分も見習わないとなってすごく思った。思春期が来たのは感じてたけど、思春期をする（語彙力）時間がなかった。それぐらい練習してたっていうところは本当にすごいなって思った。他のメンバーもマークは本当に努力家だって言ってた、言ってるけど、自分の気持ちが荒ぶる思春期の気持ちの葛藤に打ち勝って練習しなきゃって自分をコントロールしてたのは、本当に普通の人じゃできないことだと思う。マークは平凡なんかじゃないよ！！！全シズニの誇りです!!とっても努力家で、みんなに慕われて、愛されて、かっこいいのにかわいい、そんなマークに出会えて私は幸せです。これからカムバとかいろんなお仕事あると思うけどお体に気をつけて頑張ってください！childという曲に出会えて、聞けて、本当によかったし、childに込めたマークの思いも聞けて良かったです！！私もマークが誇れるマークペンになるために色々頑張らないとなって思いました。改めてマーク、アイドルになってくれて。childを生み出してくれてありがとう。,0,2022-02-17T15:04:04Z

@laylalobos397,"mark, you're so kindhearted and very well-spoken. truly, sometimes i wonder how you really put some emotions i also feel into words. being vulnerable, not only in words, but in music takes guts. when it comes
to expressing feelings, it's extremely difficult to be honest with yourself. we sometimes as human tend to overshadow our inner turmoil and bury some hard truths. i think that music is one of the rawest forms of doing so. being a writer and aspiring musician myself, it's therapeutic and eye-opening for me. i'm really tough on myself yet so gentle with others. i'm honestly so happy that you're able to express some of your emotions with us and that you trust us well enough to do so. i really respect your artwork and creativity. maybe one day i'll have the chance to say
how grateful i am to you face to face, but today i'll show my gratitude via comment section (lol). anyways, I'm so proud of you, and thankful to be there in your music journey.

You know, you have done the best for your music listeners out there. We really really really enjoyed listening to it.

So please, just keep goin’. There are so much more “possibilities” could happend forward, so yeah just walk this same path.. ☺️

@bhaklin,"omg! I normally don't make a comment but I really need to say this. Im glad you successfully saved the outro part. it's another crucial part that brings this song to another level. As a listener, a big fan of SM.. tbh, for KPOP, I mostly only listen to SM's, I know sometimes songs should turn out fun and easy to digest. but a part of me also needs something new, something a bit more difficult to understand, which make a song interesting enough to keep it on repeat.

Still, my heart really went out to him when he was saying that because of all the responsibilities placed on him as a teen (the constant pressure to keep pushing yourself and work harder), he never truly went through a rebellious stage until after his debut. 

Your passion and diligence is so inspiring, but please be kinder to yourself! We're all just people living our lives, and along this journey we make many mistakes.

@trixie1495,"Throughout my life, I've always encountered and get stuck with the same problems over and over again. On some days it's getting worse, and on some days it's better. I might not be there for you since day one, nor I have known you for a long time, but I really do get you. And how I thank God I did meet and get to know you as a person. How amazing you are. In my opinion, it's always inevitable that at one point in our lives, we'll hate ourselves, in the way that we don't think are even possible. What makes the difference is when and how do all of us are solving it in our own way. I just want to let you know that you are doing great, Mark Lee. You have so much potential in yourself and I feel like you, as someone who knows yourself best, know it too. You are continuously growing, both as a person and as a singer. All of your work has shown us that you really are passionate about what you're doing and that's really great, honestly. And how you humbled yourself down by saying that you are still a child, you still have so many things you haven't got to learn, so many things you haven't experienced, shows how modest you actually are. I'm not asking you to not be too hard on yourself because I feel like that's a thing that can only be done by yourself. It's fine to have a little doubt, it's fine to have concerns about stuffs too, but I do hope it ain't eating you alive. So many people love you and they love what you do. We'll always support you no matter what happen. Pursuing your dream career at such a young age must be so hard. I'm so so so proud of you for going this far for all of these, and I can't thank you enough for that. Knowing you has been one of the greatest things I've encountered in my entire life and I just love how your presence brings me comfort every time. 'Child' is a great song and I really hope you know that. Thank you for always thinking of us even in the busiest point of your life.  You're doing great, Mark lee, and you will continue to do so. Hope you are happy with all of the love and achievements you've been receiving and please continue to do what you feel like is best for you. You do you! See you on the next song, we'll be rooting for you. Have a great year ahead, hope 2022 is treating you good so far <3",1,2022-02-16T08:02:56Z
@chitogemihaya4208,"I could never be grateful enough to Mark. The way he gifted us this song in the first place is him showing his sides he's been hiding for so long and I really hope he loves himself much more than we love him because he deserves it so so much.

@kiwii4171,"this was so beautiful. i can't even explain it properly in words how heavy this fell on me, your words are so beautiful mark, i love the way you're able to express your inner thoughts so clearly that it resonates with other people. As someone who relates a lot to what he's saying here, I really got emotional for a hot minute when he was saying those things to his younger self because it felt like he was saying it to meeee 😭😭💙💙. Child is taking a special seat in my heart forever now, thank you.",125,2022-02-16T07:52:18Z
@hotsauce8126,"The line ""different night, same nightmares"" hit me. Like mark said, Feeling the loneliness, asking for help, someone to notice your problems. Thinking the same thoughts over and over again until it gets you. I've been there and tbh it's actually hard to be in that situation. When night hits, anxiety comes in due to the same thoughts and problems that makes me overthink again and again. I wanted help from others but it's not easy to actually say that ""you need help"". It's one of the most confusing moment. When I think I'm ready to open up and tell my problems but then suddenly I just want to keep it and that makes me feel very very lonely. This song hits. I needed to process it. First time I watched the MV and read the lyrics it just passed by like nothing, but when I re-read and watched  it again and again, it tells its story and that's when I knew this song is something that I can relate my past with. To you reading this, if you can relate to the song, I want you to know that everything happens for a reason. I believe that God wouldn't let us face those problems if he didn't knew that we're going to conquer it. You are much braver than you think you are and most importantly, you are loved. Whatever it is that you are going through, you can pass that phase of your life. Life continues and so do you. God bless and sending lots of love to czennies 💚",6,2022-02-16T07:45:21Z

@sofiahenriquez1802,"Wow, all of what Mark said in this video really hit deep into my soul, so I wanted so write some words in case he ever reads this. Ironically I've been having the same thoughts over and over again keeping me awake at night. I have a hard time feeling lonely like it's just me and my problems and things will never get better. Knowing that someone I look up to as an artist and as a person, still has these insecurities even after being loved by the crowd makes me feel more normal and be even more proud of him for openly talking about his feelings and keeping it real. I know there's a low chance that you're reading this Mark, but if you ever do, I hope you can work on loving yourself as much as we do, we all have different life perspectives so we never know what's on other people's minds but as long as you forgive yourself for whatever you think might be wrong with you and embrace the good and bad things that make you the awesome, hard-working and inspiring person you are, then that's the most valuable thing you'll have, besides having God on your side looking out for you and loving you even more than we can ever do. 

I hope there was a way to let you know what kind of person you are in my eyes, but I think this is the closest it can be to me portraying it: Beautiful. Worthy of Love. A talented kid that works hard for his goals. A candle that can light up even the darkest room just by being there (I hope that made sense lol, in my head it did). Important. And last but not least- HUMAN. 

I know that it's tough to not be hard on yourself when you're determined to achieve your goals or even when working on a new project, I'm the same way (like if it's not stressful, then I'm doing something wrong or wasting time☠️), this leads to being very self-aware abt your actions and overthinking about life. I hope you realize that we'll support you even if you see yourself as a ""bad kid"" just like a mother loves her children unconditionally, we cherish you and all of your efforts. Love from fans can feel very distant because we don't know you 100% but your impact in our lives is more than enough for us to be thankful, love and support you. Please give young Mark a big bear hug and tell him that he did a great job, his sacrifice was worth it and you deserve to be as happy as you can with the life you've lived so far💗

Thank you for sharing 'Child' with us, you were right, this is the best gift you could ever give us.💝Te amo markitos~  Cheer up! (lmao this was long asf but I couldn't leave without commenting )",16,2022-02-16T07:26:56Z

@rosalieannamu7788,"It's hard to believe how relatable it was. I'm really thankful to Mark for sharing his truest private thoughts. We all go through those hard times, even if they hit in a different way, we all find it hard to suffer from it. All the things you said give a lot of support and actually made my eyes go wide because it's so important to feel understood and you gave me this feeling. 
Our concerns are changing while we're growing up, it's easier to deal with the previous ones but there are many new ones that we need to deal with and suffer from. Like you said we need someone who can be there for us, who will guide us through it to not feel alone just fighting all of those nightmares. 
I wish you to always have a supportive person right by your side and even with all of those concerns just live your life the best you can, because you deserve it.

@소스맜,"사실 많은 분들이 이런 마크를 은연중에 알아봐왔지 않나 싶어요. 마크가 불면증이 있다고 말했을 때도, 그리고 카메라 앞에서 피곤해하고 표정이 좋지 않은 와중에도 열심히 참여하고 웃는 모습들에서 마크의 그런 모습을 많은 팬분들, 멤버들 그리고 스태프분들이 알아보셨을 거에요. 저라면 눈에 밟히고 걱정도 됐지만 혼자 고뇌하는 마크의 깊은 마음 속에 감히 들어갈 수 없다는 생각이 강하게 들었겠지만요.
 마크는 혼자가 아니에요. 이렇게 마크를 응원하는 많은 사람들 앞에서 솔직하게 말해줘서 고마워요. 
 팬들은 떠나지 않아요. 마크가 말했듯이 우리는 모두가 각자의 문제를 가지고 있고, 때로는 홀로 깊은 심연 속으로 가라앉기도 해요. NCT마크이기 전에 사람 이마크의 모습을 드러내줘서 고마워요. 이로써 마크가 걱정하는 팬들과의 연결고리는 더욱 단단해졌을 거라 믿어요. 
 마크가 이런 마크의 문제들을 조금은 수면위로 꺼내주어서 오히려 다행이라는 생각이 들어요. 안 그랬다면 마크도 더 힘들었을 테고, 팬들도 걱정이 되었을 거에요. 
 우리는 항상 마크를 지켜보고 있어요. 마크의 변화를 알아채고 있었어요. 그리고, 앞으로도 알아봐 줄게요..! 팬들은 걱정하지 마세요. 마크는 마크가 하고싶은 것들을 해주면 돼요. 마크, 사랑해요!^^",6,2022-02-16T05:39:30Z

나이는 나보다 어리지만 나이에 비해 참 성숙하고 배울점이 참 많은 친구구나 라고  생각을 했었는데 계속 나라는 존재에 대해 끊임없이 생각하고 목표와 꿈을 향해 달려나가려는 모습들이 있어서 그렇게 느꼈나봐
그리고 하고 싶은 주제와 표현들이 넘쳐나서 참 다행이야!
노래를 통해 마크라는 사람을 더 다양하고 깊게 알아갈 수 있어서 너무 좋거든 ㅎㅎㅎ
마크가 성장하는 과정 가운데 고군분투하는 모습들, 버거워하는 모습들, 예민한 모습들, 실수하는 모습들, 그렇지만 결국 해내고마는,  마크만의 본연의 모습을 찾아가고 성장하는 모습들을 난 아끼고 사랑해
자연스러운게 아름답다고 여기는 마크야
네 덕에 나도 나다운것이 뭔지 찾아가는 중이야! 
물론 좋은 면도 있고 나쁜 면도 있겠지만 그런 모습 조차도 나인거니깐! 
나도 나를 좀 봐주고 보살펴주어야겠더라고~
나는 너를 통해 배우고 성장하듯이 너도 우리의 무한한 지지와 애정을 통해 많은걸 느끼고 위로받았으면 좋겠다! 우리 오래오래 함께 손잡고 걸어가자~♥♥",18,2022-02-16T05:36:33Z

@mysa2350,"It's really rare of mark talking abouy himself, his emotions and all his thoughts. He always kinda keeps himself behind some barriers. I'm glad he opened up. I wont say it was easy to do that but at least he overcame that. I wanna tell you pushing yourself is good. But dont push yourself too hard that you stand near your end. Thats what i as an enfp think. Being an introvert is hard. It really is i know cause i have 3 best friends and we've been together for 1e years. I'm 19 now. We almosy spent 2/3 of our lives together. So i wanna say keep the ones around who you feel safe, loved with. And dont think about other's perspective. I know as an idol it must be hard. But mark YOU and YOUR LIFE comes first to you. So besides your profession you should also give a chance to your real inner self. Well thats what i believe. 

Lastly thank you mark. Thanks for saying these words. I've been in a deep hole or cage for months. I have to choose my profession or the subject i wanna study. Its really a hard decision cause my entire life depends on it and i can't make any mistake. So please pray for me. And i always pray to god to give what is better for me. That's why I'm not aiming for ""my dream"" cause maybe he has a better plan for me. But I'm so confused at this time. It's like I'm torn between what i like and what i actually can do.

@k00359,"가장 인상 깊었던 건 스스로에게 넌 평범하다고 말해주고 싶다는 그말 
어린 시절부터 평범하지만은 않았을 많은 스포트라이트와 관심과 사랑 속, 그 이면에는 24세의 평범한 `Child` 인간으로서의 마크가 얼마나 많은 스트레스와 어려움들이 있었을지 감히 상상도 안되게 힘들었을것 같아서 눈물이 주륵주륵 나기도 하고,

수없이 많은 일들을 이겨내고 단단한 사람이 되어 가수로써 팬에게 줄 수 있는 최고의 선물인 노래를
통해 위로와 감동을 선사하는 마크가 이 시대 진정한 아티스트라는 생각이 들어요!

진심 어린 마크의 한마디 한마디와, 멀리서 지켜봐도 느껴지는 긍정+선한영향력이
저의 삶에도 스며들고 귀감이 되어줘요. 마크는 외모도 너무 멋있는 사람이지만, 단단한 내면에서 나오는 그 겸손한 아우라가 말로 형용할수 없을만큼 멋진 사람으로 보이게 해줘요.
 
다정하게 마크가 항상 다른 이들을 보살펴 주듯이, 자신의 마음 또한 잘 보살펴주기를 바라고 응원해요.
마크 사랑해요♡",80,2022-02-16T03:17:55Z

""People are so lonely. People can be so lonely and at the end it's just them wanting help."" 

And the last part.....i feel like i was about to cry.... Mark was speaking about things what he wanted to tell to the ""child"" mark. This part of the video, it feels like mark is also speaking to me, to us. He said to the child mark that 'you're normal'. I feel like we may have different lives, yes we do, like we live our adolescent lives or teenage years differently but i learned from mark that you're still normal, even though you do things differently from others. As what he said to the ""child"" young mark, ""to have no regrets,"" ""to feel yourself grow,"" and ""to also love yourself."" I've learned so much from mark, especially right now, with his song child. with the song itself, I've learned a lot from it. And i was glad that i was able to learn from this right now that I'm still  in my teenage years. I will apply what he had learned from his teenage life to myself, to my teenager self right now. And so, thank you Mark. Thank you.",2,2022-02-16T01:50:50Z

Mark has brought to life the  questions and worries I'm sure alot of us are worried ir scared to admit or address. But the way he put its, its mind blowing thinking that even someone who is look so positive and bright could have such thoughts. It's not easy and I commend Mark for all this hard work no matter what state he is. 

We all need to be told that we are doing well and that we are love for us to sometimes admit ourself its true. And who Mark is, is a constant reminder of how lucky and blessed we are. We are human and we have our ups and downs. But we are all doing well, no matter what life looks like. We are doing well. So keep going.

@japanesekoreanfan2,"My immediate response to his ""how do people see me?"" question was: a precious little bean. 

When he said his adolescence didn't really happen for him until after he debuted, I felt that that was very true. Not only was Mark going to regular middle and high school during his trainee days, he also had to learn all the different styles of dancing that the company felt he should know to be a well-rounded dancer for any type of song he'd encounter, he had to learn how to rap properly, how to feel the flow in any kind of beat he'd be handed, how to sing well when he was expected to sing, how to talk in the public sphere in interviews and such and be an entertainer, and how to work as part of a team. That's a lot of things he had to learn in the three years he was at the company before he debuted. If he'd let adolescent urges to rebel come to the forefront of his brain, he never would have learned as much as he did in as short a time frame as he did. 

I think it's perfectly fine that he feels like a child sometimes. I feel that my curiosity to learn new things and be in awe of stuff like the complexity of the human body or the universe comes from me wanting to stay childlike in ways that matter. 

Mark, if you ever read this, know that we always have your back and there are those of us who understand that you are just a human being and nobody is perfect. You doing the best you can in every situation you've encountered is what matters. When you feel like you are in your own head too much, just remember your members are there for you as well. Even if they don't say it, many of them have probably had the same thoughts you've had and can help you out. We love you as you are, flaws, doubts, self-esteem issues and all. As a GAP commercial from this past Christmas said, ""you do you boo.""",43,2022-02-15T22:49:37Z

At the end of the day, he's just human, despite all the pressure, expectations, and selfishness that the public weighs down on him.

I'm not there but I'm still trying I guess. It's always hard to reach out to people but at the same time want them to notice. It's a constant turmoil. Sometimes you actually forget many are going through this same shit. Listening to this song and watching this video I'm constantly reminded that even someone like Mark is going through this as well. It's comforting to hear his thoughts cause it feels like I'm the one actually saying them. Hope you'll always be you and come to love yourself eventually Mark.

@marcy.c,"I really like the fact that the song is named child and that mark expresses how he feels as a young, inexperienced, uneducated and curious person and who also needs guidance and discipline because nowadays we kind of ""insult"" people saying they're childish. I believe that these attributes really make the pureness and openness of a child and that we should always be like a child (of course we also need to behave and not always cause trouble but you know where I'm getting)
If we saw the world as a child, the problems would seem less hard to process and we'd be more expressive about ourselves and our emotions and also care less about being serious, showing a certain image.

마크의 시간을 지나가는 혹은 지나가지 않는 무수히 많은 고민에서 크고 작은 답이 나올 것이고, 그게 지금껏 그래왔듯 마크를 마크로 만들겠죠. 그 과정이 쉽지 않아도 당연하다는 듯 나아갈 사람이라 응원하게 돼요. 불가항력처럼. 

타인이 보는 마크에는 수많은 레이어가 있을 거예요. 우리는 서로를 오해하고 그럼에도 이해하려고 애쓰죠. 마크에게는 그 중 이해만이 남길 바라요. 마크를 이해하려 노력하는 이들을. 사랑이라 부르는 마음을. 세간의 말들에서 필요한 의미만을 흡수할 수 있기를 바랍니다. 그런 날이 오고야 말 거예요. 이런 말조차도 가볍게 스쳐갈 뿐이니까요.",22,2022-02-15T18:56:44Z

One way or another we find the reason to doubts ourself, to put ourself under someone else, to think we are not capable, to think we are not eligible as others. But at the end of the day we all are same. From homeless to billionaire, we are all someone who is trying hard to accept and love ourselves. So Mark, you are not alone. In my eyes we are just the same. Take a deep breath, pat yourself and say ""I am fine, i am normal as everyone on this earth. I am not alone,  instead i have tons of people who loves me just as i am. More importantly i have God who loves me unconditionally. As long as i have him, what to bother.""

@segye0_ng,"Child는 완벽한 타이밍에 발매된 곡이 아닌가 싶어요. 적어도 저에겐 그래요! 이번 영상에서도, 이전의 인스타 라이브에서도 마크가  이번 음악발매의 의미와 더불어 발매시기에  많은 신경을 기울이고 있다는걸 느꼈어요. 그 진심어린 마음과 고민들이 모여서 많은 사람들에게 우연한 시기에 우연한 따뜻함과 위로를 전해주고 있다고 생각해요.
 신기하게도 child 발매 이틀 전 우연히 nct영상을 접하고, 마크의 영상을 찾아보면서 마크를 존경하는 마음을 가지게 되었어요. 모든 기회를 소중하게 여기고, 항상 곁에 있는 사람을 배려하는 모습을 정말 닮고 싶어졌고, 앞으로의 행보를  지켜보며 응원하고 싶어졌어요. 그리고 Child가 나온 후에는 음악과 몇몇 코멘터리를 보며 현재 제 상황에 있어 큰 위로를 받았어요. 우리는 모두 어린아이이고, 끊임없이 ‘난 누구지?’라는 질문을 던지는 사람이라는 것. 이 직설적이고도 단순한 공감이 마음을 잠재워주는 큰 힘을 가지고 있는 것 같아요. 이번 솔로곡을 통해 마크라는 사람, 또 아티스트가 누구인지 더 알 수 있었던 것 같아 정말 행복해요!
 마크가 그동안 말해왔던 ‘단순하지만 중요한 가치’가 온전히 전달된 것 같아요. 모든 과정에서 진심이 느껴지고 마음을 움직이네요. 최고의 선물 정말 고마워요!",8,2022-02-15T17:57:29Z

Im a teenager-adult, im trying everyday to live for my dreams and keep my feet on the ground at the same time. It has not been easy, loneliness approaches, that gut feeling of not being enough, the depression episodes that are caused by that constant anxiety for my future. The thing everyone expect of me and more triggering what i expect from myself... sometimes i get stucked. I dont mean to sound negative or anything like that, is just that Chid portrays that frustration so  beatifully that i just think Mark needs a recognition for making this piece.

mark has such an image of beinga  nice guy its impossible to live up to that all te time because is normal to also have bad days, so when he says he thinks hes not neccassarily a good guy, i thinik hes talking about how he knows people view him and in his minid hes ot quite that guy , but no one is is human and normal, marks is agreat oerson teh fact he even considers a real ad guy wouldnt even have ideas like that, your just human mark and is normal . to grow up from being so young in teh entertainment undustry it can really mess someone up , its impossible to have that kind of pressure at that young age and not be effected in some way, but he has handled and remains such a stand up guy , how do others see him, i t8inik hthey can see things he might not see in himself and he is as good as it gets, truly talented guy <3 hope to see more of mark solo work, i love the insight it gives, and more from teh other nct guys, this content is top level stuff for fans x",0,2022-02-15T17:14:19Z

Through ups and downs, we are all here. I can’t wait to see you grow, to come back to this after 5yrs and see how far you’ve come and where you are going next. Thank you for Child.

It's genuinely so inspiring listening to you talking about your growing process, the way you look at things. Not just this video, the music space video with Johnny interviewing you was such a nice video too, you talking about the work with Dress and everything, it's so nice getting to know more about you as a person, as an artist too.

I know 'Child' was a gift to the fans but I want to really thank YOU for it. For everything actually, for working so hard, for being so into what you do, for your passion, it's been a few years already since your debut and I still feel the same burning passion coming from you, I hope I get to see more of it. Remember that we will always have your back, literally appreciate and love u a lot. I find 'Child' has MARK all over it, it has your vibe. 

Remember that it's okay to be troubled sometimes or all the time too, about what u are, who u are and how other people percieve you, wishing you the best to keep figuring out your own path, do it at your own rhythm.",1,2022-02-15T16:52:40Z

You and me are the exact same age but we’ve had completely different life experiences thus far and yet we feel similar things as young adults. It makes me feel a little better and reassured knowing that I’m not the only young adult with these feelings. Thank you so much for the song. We your fans love and support you so much.

가사 는 물론 
그 멜로디도 감정이 있고 구성도 뮤비 스토리 도

This is indeed the best gift we've ever received from you. This song is really relatable and so much more comforting. If you're curious about what the fans think of you as a person, let me tell you as a fan ever since SM rookies era, that you are the most thoughtful, articulate, hard working, unique, considerate and the strongest person I've ever known. You've grown up to be a really incredible human being. We czennies couldn't be more proud of you. You've been working really hard (sometimes too hard) without having much time to rest. We all really want you to not be hard on yourself and stay healthy. I also want you to know that we really respect you as an idol as well as just yourself. We really hope you never lose your true self and keep being the person that you are.

Child가 처음 공개됐을때 이미 아 마크한테 이런 면도 있구나 생각하기는 했지만 그 가사가 정말 그렇게까지 진심을 다 담은 가사일 거라고는 생각을 안했던거 같아. 정말 자기의 음악이었고 자기 이야기를 하고 있었는데 내멋대로 '그래도 아이돌이니까' 그냥 회사에서 어느정도 정해준 컨셉이겠지 쉽게 생각하고 판단해버린게 너무너무 미안해. 지금까지의 내 생각을 다 뒤집는거 같아. 정말 수많은 사람들에게서 사랑을 받지만 자기 자신에게는 똑같이 안좋은 점들도 보이고 마음에 안들때도 있는 사람이라는게... 정말 당연한 건데 똑같이 단점도 있을거고 남들의 시선도 신경쓸거고 자존감도 떨어지고 그럴텐데 그걸 여태 까맣게 생각하지 못한 내가 무서워. 마크는 나에게 정말 힘이 돼 라는 말이 사실 나에게 밝고 웃는 모습만 보여주고 힘이 돼주라고 강요하고 있었던게 아닌가 생각이 들어. 어떤것들 때문에 잠에 못드는 걸까 마크를 힘들게 하는 것들이 많이 사라지면 좋겠다고 기도했고 누구보다 마크를 사랑한다고 생각했는데 내가 바로 그동안 마크를 잠들지 못하게 했던 것들 중에 하나였구나 싶고 나는 여태 정말 단편적이고 피상적인 것들만 보고 있었구나 싶어. 그리고 이런 모습들이 낯설다는게 내가 여태 마크의 보고 싶은 면들만 보고 믿고 싶은 대로만 믿었던건 아닐까 그동안 마크를 좋아했던 나 자신을 되돌아보게 돼.
어쩌면 연예인은 마음대로 슬퍼할수도 없는 가장 슬픈 직업이 아닐까 하는 생각이 들어. 마크는 팀 내에서도 유독 정말 바쁘게 생활하는데 팬들이 걱정할때마다 오히려 기회가 많이 주어져서 감사하게 생각한다 말하고 걱정이나 고민이 있으면 그걸 감추려고 노력하고 팬들에게는 행복하고 좋은 모습만 보여주고 싶다는게 너무 고마우면서도 미안하고 마음이 아파.
""혹시 누군간 공감할까 지금만큼은 알아주면 안될까"" 하는 가사에서 항상 밝다가도 언뜻언뜻 조금씩 보이던 다운된 모습들도 스쳐 지나가고 전에 올린 글에 있던 문장들이랑... 다 스쳐 지나가면서 하나하나 와닿는 느낌이고 아 결국에 마크가 말하고 싶었던건 이거구나 하면서 반성하게 돼.
직업 특성상 모든말을 하기전에 조심해야 하다보니 많이 에둘러 말해서 내가 맞게 이해한건지는 모르겠지만.. 
'자유'는 '진짜 나'가 되는것이고 나를 자유롭지 못하게 막는 것은 이 세상과 이 사회이다.. 그리고 결국 마크에게 책임감을 요구하고 마크의 어깨를 무겁게한 세상은 우리가 만든게 아니었을까? 
사람들이 사랑하는게 진짜 '나'가 아닌 그저 만들어진 이미지라면 사실 다른 누구보다 자기 자신이 제일 힘들거 같아. 근데 아이돌이라는 직업 특성상 그런 이미지메이킹이 아예 없을수는 없고 그 사이에서 진짜 나는 무엇일까 고민하고 그리고 사람들이 바라보는 나와 진짜 나 사이에서 갈등하고 고뇌한 내용을 이번 child 라는 노래로 표현한 거라고 생각해. 마크는 항상 오랫동안 음악을 하고 싶다고 했고 항상 음악의 솔직함과 진실성을 강조했잖아 이제 서서히 '진짜 마크'를  드러낼 준비를 하는게 아닐까 하고 생각해. 그리고 나는 완전히 준비됐고 앞으로가 너무 두근거리고 기대된다. 우리에게 child mark를 알려줘서 고마워",1,2022-02-15T16:06:55Z

@camarynr11,"Mark, that was so beautiful. I think that it's amazing that you're able to be so aware with yourself and be able to share that with us fans. Child is such a honest, blunt, and open representation of yourself and it reaches so many of us fans. Having struggled through our youths with worries of insecurities, hating ourselves, and not being able to understand who we are, it's simply so nice to have you with us. I really do thank God that he allowed NCT into my life, because you guys feel like a second family to me; you provide me with such strength, inspiration, and joy. But you guys aren't always happy, you aren't always ok and that's normal, it's okay, and it's nothing for you to worry about. You don't always have to show yourselves in a positive, happy, or ""perfect"" light. We love you guys for who you are even if you aren't sure of who you are, because we're all lost and constantly changing into different versions of ourselves. Just... Thank you Mark, thank you for being you, whoever that may be :)",7,2022-02-15T16:04:59Z

@hey-diddlediddle,"OMG I am so glad that I correctly guessed what the song was about.. Mark is the most mature, well-behaved member but ironically his song about his life is titled ""child"". I thought about the irony and realized because his debut was so early he was forced to mature/behave/make no mistake since very young since so many eyes are watching. This rushed growth and expectations must have been traumatic for Mark and there is still child, real Mark himself (not the idol persona) in him that wants to be free. <-- this was my interpretation. 
마크야.. 웬만한 사람같았으면 네가 그렇게 어린 나이에 겪은 부담감과 주위의 기대를 이겨내지 못하고 무너졌을지도 몰라 사생때문에 마음대로 숙소 밖에도 못 나가는 삶을 살면서 엔시티가 너무 네오해서 대중에 외면받는 동안에도 계속 음악적인 성과를 올려야 했고 드림 127 U 빠지지 않고 활동하면서도 멘탈 무너지지 않고 사랑둥이라는 별명을 얻을 정도로 자라나는거 진짜 쉬운 일이 아닌것 같아. 마크야 널 리스펙트해. 건강하게 오래 활동해줘!!",0,2022-02-15T15:56:55Z
@lailypendy1271,"That part in Mark's song where he seeks help and he want someone to notice him or his problems. I always cry on that part as someone who always seeks help, a comfort from someone, longing for attention. But then Mark Lee gave it all, although he's not beside me to comfort me in person, just him and his existence are already enough to fill all of that. That's why I'm very thankful to you, Mark Lee. Thank you for sharing all of this to us, for giving us something we can all relate to and Child, it was a great song and a masterpiece. As you said, don't let anything bring us down so forget all the judgements, we just need to be ourselves and be kinder to ourselves. LOVE OURSELVES.",297,2022-02-15T15:56:50Z

Tbh, what i like most about him are his humility, gratefulness and genuineness, bcuz I guess for a successful idol like him, traits like these are very rare to find; and he's got em all. Even 'Child"" happened just with his thought of it as a gift for his fans. He's that amazing! 🥺 

Mark, know that your troubles and feelings are always valid. And although you mentioned that you often worry about others' opinions, just don't let it get to a point where it constantly bothers you. Take care of yourself please, especially your mental and emotional state. Maybe just stick first to what you think best suits and describes you before anything else, and then you can go on with that. We hope that the drive you have right now to never be lost just like us your fans, who'll forever be by your side, endlessly supporting you. We'll patiently wait for what's more in store from your music :)) No pressure! Do it for yourself + the people you care about, and that's enough. :)

Congratulations Mark! Child has been a success so far. Keep em coming! We love you, always and forever. 💚",190,2022-02-15T15:21:56Z

@cerceilia90,"그냥 마크 꼬옥 안아주고싶다
마크가 이런 생각들을 가지고 있는지 몰랐어 이 영상을 통해서 마크에 대해 더 깊게 , 많이 , 몰랐던 부분들도 알게 된 것 같아.

작년에 마크를 알게 되었는데 나에게 마크는 행복전도사 , 긍정의 아이콘이었어. 내가 항상 힘들거나 우울할 때마다 마크의 웃음 영상이나 마크의 보컬이 많이 들어간 노래를 듣곤 했어. 우울의 끝자락까지 들어갈뻔한 나를 구해준건 마크야. 정말 너무 고마워. 

마크가 생각하는 본인이 남들에게는 정말 좋은 사람이고, 본인에게는 좋은 사람이 아니라고 했는데 무슨 말인지 이해가 돼.
나도 남들에게 좋은 사람일수도, 나쁜 사람일수도 있겠지만 항상 나 자신에게는 좋은 사람이 아니거든. 내 자신에게 더 엄격해지고, 더 막하게 되고, 내가 나를 존중해주지 못하는거 같아. 하지만 마크는 나보다 더 단단하니까 마크 자신에게도 좋은 사람이 될 수 있을것 같아. 그게 언제가 될 진 몰라도 꼭 이겨낼거라고 믿어. 그리고 마크는 항상 잘하고 있고, 열심히 하는 모습을 팬들이 다 알아 그러니까 너무 부담가지지 않았으면 좋겠어. 

항상 건강이 제일 중요하니까 아프지말고 오래오래 함께 천천히 걸어나가자. 우리가 곁에서 항상 함께할게. 정말 많이 사랑해 마크야. 

마크의 모든 날을 응원하고 기도할게. 오늘 밤도 꿈꾸지말고 푹 자길 바라.",0,2022-02-15T15:18:30Z

그런데 마크야, 정말 힘들 때 마음과는 다른 길을 가는 사람도 있는데 마크는 자신을 사랑하는 길로 가잖아. 결국엔 너가 너를 사랑하는 길로 돌파구를 찾는다는건 어쩌면 이미 너는 널 정말 사랑하고 있는거 아닐까? 자신을 망치고 회피하는 길도 있는데 너는 너를 내면적으로 더 단단하게 만들고자 하니까 말이야.

@Alskfusjfl,"‘언제쯤 어른아이에서 벗어날 수 있을까? 벗어날 수는 있을까?’ 
언젠가 내가 썼던 일기의 한 부분이야
숫자도 겉모습도 나는 이미 다 자란 어른인데 
아직도 내 마음 속엔 마냥 어린 내가 존재하는 것 같아서 자책하던 날들이 많았었는데, 마치 이런 내 마음을 대변해주는 것 같았던 Child..
나만 이런 생각을 하는 줄 알았는데 마크도 이런 생각을 하며 살아가는걸보니 이건 비단 마크만의 문제도, 나만의 문제도 아닌건가봐 :) 
내가 나 자신을 온전히 받아들이고 인정할 수 있을때 그때야말로 어른아이에서 벗어날 수 있는거겠지? 
다른 사람이 보는 나는 어떤 사람일까? 같은 물음도 
결국은 내가 바라보는 ‘나’가 ‘내’ 맘에 드는 사람이 되었으면.. 하는 바램에 생기는 궁금증인 것 같기도 하고..! 
이렇게 치열하게 나 자신에 대해 고민하고 생각하는 시간들이 결국엔 나를 더 나은 사람으로 만들어 줄 거라는건 분명하니까.
그러면 결국에 더 나은 내가 나의 마음에도 쏙 드는 날이 올거라 믿어 :) 
그래서 나는 나의 그리고 마크의 이 치열한 시간들을 응원해주고 싶다! 

이렇게 멋진 음악을 선물해주어서 너무 고마워 마크야! 

Anyone can be the person they want. We have the ability to do so. 
Correcting myself frees me much more than gaining any knowledge.

@moensa25,"난 마크만큼 바쁘게 살아본 적도 없고 마크만큼 무언가에 미쳐서 열심히 해본 적도 없지만 그래도 꽤나 스스로를 혹독하게 다루는 편이라 고작 15분짜리 이 영상이 마음을 꽤나 헤집어 흩어놓았다.

악몽보다 더 악몽같은 불면에 시달리던 밤, 자책하고 자학하며 스스로가 끔찍해서 엉엉 울던 밤, 영원한 타인의 적의에 맞서기 위해 밑바닥에서 긁어왔던 투지의 밤이 쌓였다. 쌓이고 쌓이다 끝내 터져서는 활활 타올랐다. 화마는 순식간에 제 온 세상을 집어삼켰고 모든 것이 재로 뒤엎힐 때까지 결코 멈추지 않았다. 그 건 순식간이었고 이내 온통 텅 비어버렸다. 그런 것만 같았다.
그 공허하고 차갑게 식어버린 잿더미 속에서 아주 희미하게 숨을 토해내는 조그마한 불꽃이 보인다. 불꽃은 아주 약하지만 천천히 들이쉬고 내쉬며 일렁이고 있다. 이 불은 나를 집어삼키고 주변 사람들까지 태우려는 화마가 아니야. 그냥 누군가 손을 뻗으면 미적지근한 온기를 내어주는 성냥불이다. 눈보라 치는 성탄절 전야, 어느 시골의 오두막에서 온 가족이 둘러앉은 벽난로를 타닥이는 불이다. 칠흙같은 어둠 속에서 아주 작고 여린 빛을 내어 하루의 시작을 비추는 새벽별이다.

마크, 차일드를 발표해줘서 고마워. 문제를 계속 일으키고 다니고 그렇게 다른 누군가의 도움을 갈구하고 그래도 괜찮은 거라고 그게 노멀이라고 말해줘서 고마워. 우린 영원히 차일드일 거라고 말해줘서 고마워. 네 덕분에 이제 나는 마음 속에서 일어나는 불을 더는 두려워하지 않아. 나를 집어삼키고 태워버렸던 잿더미에서 피어난 이 불꽃은 이제 그냥 이렇게 바람을 타고 일렁이고만 있어. 더는 아무것도 태우지 않는 이 작은 불이 누군가에게는 온기가 되길 바라며 고요하게 숨쉬고 있어.

Have a good night, Mark🙃",2,2022-02-15T14:18:40Z

You're the same age as my oldest grandson, who also relates to his inner child when talking to grandma about his thoughts. You're right ... the young people out there should be aware that they will have their up days ... and most important ... they will have their down days. Confused and Scared sometimes ... but they will be okay ... because it's a growing process that you just have to embrace.

@amethystsu5576,"Mark, like you said and acknowledged, you are a child, so don't be too hard on yourself. You are normal; there will always be ups and downs and there are just times where we are stuck in our heads with our problems, but I hope that one day, even if you can't say that you're a nice guy to yourself, you are at least not a bad guy to yourself. You are right that you are very good at looking at yourself from a third person point of view, knowing very well what you problems are and what you need to do, but we all struggle to be what we think we should be and need to do sometimes, don't we? That said, I pray you will be able to love yourself like you said. And on those days you struggle to do that, remember that your family, friends, loved ones, fans, us... we are here for you and we love you. No matter how we try to understand you a little, forgive that nobody is always able to get someone right --- at that time, remember too, that you should reach out and let people know what is on your mind. If you need, cry and complain like the child you want to be, so that people around you know how to help. And I'm sure they will, because you are a very much loved person.",0,2022-02-15T14:10:21Z

마크에게 좋은 자양분이 될 수 있길 그리고 되도록이면
그 생각이 너를 오래 잡아두지 않길 기도해

@ddochibread,"항상 마크는 큰 힘이 되어주는 것 같아요
저도 살면서 남에게 보여지는 난 어떨까, 누굴까 라는 질문을 많이 하기도 하고 마음 한 켠에 깊이 뭍어둔 질문이기도 했어요
아직도 해결되지 않은 질문이지만,,, 어쩌면 끝까지 해결되지 않을 질문이라고도 생각해요
하지만 이번에 마크가 선물해준 CHILD 곡을 통해 마음의 위로가 많이 되었어요
성인이 되었지만 아직도 어린 아이이고 싶을 때가 많더라구요
부족하고 어리숙하고 반항적일 때도 많은데 어른이라는 틀이 그 모든 면들을 부끄럽게 만들더라구요
그것 또한 나라는 말이 너무 와닿았어요
나를 사랑하는 것에 대해 다시금 생각해보게 되구요
너무 큰 힘을 얻는 것 같아 마크에게 너무 고맙습니다❤

@iwannagohomerightnow,"오빠도 혼잣말로 솔직하게 얘기했으니까 나도 여기 해도 되지? 누구에게 닿을지 모르는 이야기기는 하지만.. 이번 노래 들으면서 느꼈던 것들은 지금까지랑은 좀 종류가 다르던데 듣다보면 맘이 답답해지고 눈물이 날 것 같은 기분이 들어서 솔직히 처음에는 자주 못 들었어 며칠에 걸쳐서 몇 번 듣고서야 익숙하게 듣는데 오늘 이 영상 보니까 그 이유를 알겠다.. 내 밤들이 이 노래랑 너무 닮아서 그랬나봐
나는 얼마 안 살았어 오빠보다도 그리고 여기 있는 많은 사람들보다도 어릴 텐데 그동안 많은 일이 있었거든 그동안 쭉 생각해왔던 게 있는데 공감해줄 사람도 없는 것 같고 이 주제에 대해서 얘기를 할 사람도 없어서 그냥 속으로만 몇천번씩 혼자 생각했던 것 같아 큰 일이 있었던 밤이나 새벽에.. 응 그리고 이런 생각 하는건 나 혼자인 줄 알았고 그게 날 이상하게 만든다고 생각했어 진짜로 공감해주는 사람을 아직 만난 적이 없었거든.. 그런데 생판 남인 오빠랑 처음 듣는 새로운 노래에 이렇게 공감하게 될 줄이야ㅋㅋㅋ 그것만으로도 나한테 위로가 됐다면 이 마음이 전달이 될까?? 노래 들으면서도 그렇고 오늘 혼잣말 하는거 보면서도 혼자 나도! 나도! 이러면서 봤는데 그냥 이런 생각하는 사람이 또 있다는게 위로가 되는 것 같아.. 그래서 너무 고맙고 그래요

남한테는 항상 좋은 사람이 되고 싶었어
얼마전에 그게 안 된다는 걸 알았지만.. 나도 나한테는 별로 좋은 사람이 못 되는 것 같아 
그래도 하나 희망을 품는건 난 예전엔 이런 생각을 해본 적도 없다는거고 지금 나는 안다는거겠지? 결국 나아질 수 있다는거니까
평생 나는 완벽해질 수 없겠지만 평생 더 나은 삶을 살아갈 수 있다는 게 나는 이제 좋아
물론 나는 오빠랑 다르지만 그럼에도 이 노래에 공감할 수 있다는 게 감사해
나는 나 신경쓰느라 다른 사람 응원하는거 잘 못했는데 오빠는 너무 응원하고 싶은 마음이 드네
덕질하는동안 좋기만 한 건 아니었지만 진짜로 온전하게 남을 응원하고 사랑하는 법을 배운 것 같아

@aerimarkf6798,"Firstly, my answer to the question
Mark: What am I to other people?
         Well, Mark, you are the precious one for us, for NCTzens, for Mark's friends. You may be someone's role model, someone's ideal type, someone's imaginary boyfriend, someone's best friend in dream, someone's beloved one(not as a boyfriend), idol, probably just an artist for someone. However people feel you or see you in different ways, you are the best when you do you, you being you, you being Mark.
You really are more than an idol.
For me, you are my ideal type, the irreplaceable one.

Secondly, I'm really glad to hear that you think to love yourself. That's what I've been deeply concerned.
Since you're super duper busy and focus on your work, I was worried about your physical and mental health. So I'll trust you, love yourself, take care of yourself.",0,2022-02-15T13:38:06Z

@saharahee,"15분동안 마크가 보여준 너의 생각들이 정말 너라는 사람, 아티스트를 더 힘껏 지지하고 응원하게 만드는거같아. 단순히 이마크라는 아티스트의 팬이 아니라 그냥 이마크라는 사람 자체가 참 멋있고 배우고 싶다, 라고 느꼈어. 꿈을 좇는 것이 유일한 목표이자 추진력의 이유라는 말이 그동안의 나를 돌아보게도 하면서, 이마크는 정말 자신이 하는 일에 누구보다 진심이고, 잘하고 있고, 길이 뚜렷한 사람이구나를 느끼게 했어. 자신에 대해서 엄청나게 많은 생각을 하고 고뇌를 했기에 'child'처럼 의미있고 좋은 노래가 나오는거고 마크도 계속해서 성장할 수 있는 거라고 생각해! 그치만, 때로는 그냥 힘든 감정 숨기지 말고 표출했으면 좋겠어. 그래도 맠프들에게 positive energy는 전달되니까! 나 자신을 사랑하는게 제일 힘들다라는 말, 나는 평범해라는 말 들으니까 되게 울컥했어. 마크는 정말 대단한 아티스트지만 결국 우리와 똑같은 사람이구나. 그럼에도 너에게는 무수한 팬들이 있고 너는 그 팬들을 위로하고 행복하게 해주는 소중하고 특별한 사람이야. 이 사실 잊지말고 앞으로도 좋은 음악과 퍼포먼스 많이 보여줬음 좋겠어, 그게 너의 행복을 위한 길이라면! 계속해서 이마크의 음악을 감상하고 생각들을 존중하고 모든 행보를 응원하는 바람직한 팬이 될게요, 음악해줘서 정말 고맙고 이 세상에 너를 드러내줘서 너무 고마워! 사랑해 이마크!",5,2022-02-15T13:36:43Z

@Blackshi_kr,과거에 후회가 없는 사람은 없지만 그게 당시의 자신의 최선이었을거라는 말처럼 모두 자신의 나름대로 최선을 다해 살고 있지만 마크가 현재에 최선을 다하고 계속 발전하는 모습을 보고 많이 배운 것 같아. 그러면서도 긍정적이게 세상을 바라보고 감사함을 느끼는 모습이 신기했고 부정적인 감정을 더 자주 느꼈던 내가 마크를 보고 에너지를 얻고 긍정적인 사람이 되고 세상에 행복이 많다는 것을 알고 주변 사람들과 나누는 사람이 되었어.어떤 말이든 부담이 될 수 있지만 어떨지 모르는 마크의 앞날도 기대되고 응원하고 싶을 만큼 나에게 있어서 마크는 좋은 사람이야.사람들에게 좋은 영향을 주어서 고마워 소중한 마크!! 하고 싶은거 다 해 응원할게 :)😎💕,0,2022-02-15T13:33:34Z

These are kids given a number and a bed, kids that are forced to train to their limits without friends and family, they are expected to never make any mistakes and then they're thrown into the public eye where they won't be able to hide for years if not decades.

@myraclesname,"I feel like people are already misinterpreting his words. He was/is not happy with how things worked out, he feels that his job was too harsh on him and still is sometimes. Being an idol is not easy and not that fun either. It's physically and mentally exhausting and being thrown into such an extreme industry at an age you should still be free from troubles such as work is the most extreme case of stealing someone's childhood. 
What he's trying to say is that it's alright to feel that way, because it's human. If he didn't speak about his troubles with his job, he'd be lying not only to himself but to us as well. I love how SM allowed him to speak his mind freely. I hope they treat their idols well and I hope Mark has the emotional support he needs.

마크야 연습생부터 데뷔 - 솔로까지 천천히 잘 걸어와준 너에게 정말 고맙고 수고했다고 말해주고 싶어. 비록 가볍지만을 않았을 걸음과 점점 쌓이는 무게에 미안하고 그 시간을 그 무게를 잘 지탱해가면서 한발씩 내딛어 걸어와줌에 정말 대견하고 자랑스럽다 마크야. 그러니 이제는 하나씩 내려놓아도 더 천천히 걸어와도 돼 어렸을 때 부터 이미 너무 많은 경험과 시간을 보내왔기에 너의 목표와 만족이 있겠지만 나는 이제 너가 여유와 쉼을 더욱 느껴보고 만끽하는 시간이 있었으면.. 가졌으면 해 너가 좋아하는 파란색.. 파란하늘, 푸른바다 많이 보고 잘 챙겨먹고 푹 자고 건강을 돌보며 재충전하는 시간을 충분히 가졌으면 좋겠어 :) 서두르지 않아도 돼 충분히 기다릴 수 있어 우리 아직 젊고 시간 많다 애기야 :-)
너에게 오로지 행복만을 웃음을 안겨주고 싶어. 마크야  언제나 행복과 행운이 가득하기를 기도하고 있어 잘 들리겠지만ㅎㅎ 오늘도 지금도 우리는 언제나 너를 응원하고 지지해 그러니 우리 행복하자 건강하자 사랑하자 웃자. 오늘도 정말 수고많았어 마크야💙",6,2022-02-15T12:49:19Z

@RachelShauna,"I feel like to properly become an adult you need to just completely let yourself go at one point, kind of like the climax of a movie where all the story building leads to one big ""boom"". For most adolescents thats college, where you finally get to find yourself & your interests but also act out. Personally speaking i've always been extremely introverted, to the point where I became so agoraphobic that being out in public would give me panic attacks so I would need a xanax every time I left the house. Then in the classic American college experience a group of extroverts adopted me into their friend group & basically forced me to be social (which is a good thing). I partied literally every weekend, drank, smoked (dont do drugs kids..) & just completely rebelled against that inner lonely child version of ourselves we all have. 

this is going to sound kind of fucked up but I hope Mark gets a chance to completely rebel, it doesn't even have to be partying or shit like that, it could be as simple as just saying ""no"" to all those who ""control"" him & doing what he wants to truly do for a change. he has been working since he's been a child & has never had the chance to experience completely losing himself, we all break at one point and thats completely normal. 

and now that concludes my ted talk thank you to the 4 people who read this lol",24,2022-02-15T12:44:32Z

I am so proud of you. You made it this far. All those tears and sweats and hard works definitely paid off. You deserve all the love in this world. 

Thank you for creating and sharing this masterpiece; CHILD. Thank you for being able to express yourself. I want you to know that we look up to you not just because of your talent and hard work, but also your warm heart and bright thoughts. 

Just like you said, you have to learn to love yourself. You don’t have to be perfect. Just continue on becoming the good person that you already are. Be good to yourself and to others. Remember to put your happiness first too because if you are happy, we also will be happier. We always got your back, Mark.

Honestly I didn't even realize I watched him talk for a whole 15 minutes, because the way he expressed himself and his thoughts was so sincere and just true onto what he write songs about and what he wants to project to his fans that I was just so immerse onto how he answered each questions and voice out his thoughts. The ways he talks and his mindset about certain things is a thing that is so admirable about him.

@예진조-q8k,곡에 대해서 자세하게 들어볼 수 있어서 넘 좋은 것 같아요 노래가 듣는 사람 해석하기 나름이라지만 어떤 마음으로 이 노래가 만들어진걸까 궁금했거든요 솔직하게 그대로 자신에 대해 표현하는 것조차 마크 다운 것 같다고 느꼈어요 딥해질 것 같다고 하고 평소 하던 생각의 흐름대로 이야기하는 걸 멈춘 것 같았지만  잠깐이라도 마크 생각을 엿볼 수 있었던 것도 같아서 좋았고요 스스로를 제3자의 시선에서 봤을 때 그리고 스스로가 바라봤을 때 바라본 자신은 다르지만 결국엔 그 모습도 자신이라는 게 평소에 자신에 대해 꼬리에 꼬리를 물고 생각해보는 사람에게는 정말 공감가는 이야기인 것 같아요 자신에 대해 생각이 많아질 땐 두고두고 이 노래를 듣게 될 것 같네요 이런 노래 만들어줘서 고마워요,0,2022-02-15T12:24:40Z

@Rememberthemiracl_e,이 영상을 보니까 나는 마크에 대해 진짜 잘 몰랐던 거 같기도 하네 .. 마냥 긍정적인 에너지를 가지고 자신감이 언제나 넘치는 사람인 줄 알았었는데 자신을 사랑하는 일이 쉽지 않았다고도 얘기하면서 이렇게 자기 자신에 대해 심오하고 깊게 생각하는 사람이었다는 걸 한 번 더 깨닫게 되어서 기쁘기도 하고 조금 씁쓸하기도 하고 ... Child라는 곡을 통해서 마크라는 사람에 대해 더 자세히 알게 되고 너만의 음악성을 알려주어서 정말 고마워 마크야 네가 어떤 음악을 하든 어떤 길을 가든 항상 응원할게 좋은 노래 만들어주고 들려줘서 고마워 사랑해 ❤️❤️,0,2022-02-15T12:21:34Z

We kinda know their personality and their traits since it is close impossible to be on camera for that long and fake a whole persona. But listen to what he’s saying.. I have never heard/seen THIS side of mark yet this has been him for years, he said it himself! This video does not change my opinion on him I still love him with all my heart and will support anything he puts out, but this was strangely intimate.. It made me look at him differently and acknowledge that being an idol, especially  for those who started very young, has very long term effects. He’s very self aware and says that he’s not a good guy from his perspective, he obviously knows why, reasons we would probably never know cause that’s his personal struggles but.. wow. This is very rare for an idol to let people in so much. Makes me realise these ship videos and all that does not even come close to what they’re really like on the day to day.",0,2022-02-15T12:19:12Z

I didn’t know that he has a lot of worries in his mind but like what he have said, it’s inevitable to have those. As a child, there’s a point in our life where we wanted to be acknowledge or recognize by other people. We are all blinded by the fact that the attention that we want from other people is a proof that we don’t trust ourselves. We want to feel validated and as we try to receive a recognition from them, we forget to live for ourselves. Realistically speaking, other people won’t help us to be better. We are the only one who can help ourselves to be better and be the person who we want us to be. I hope each everyone of us can love ourself first before the others. Mark Lee, you are so loved.

너의 사춘기를 너 스스로가 받아드리기엔 사회는 너를 압박하고있었고 수많은 인간관계와 연습속에서 십대를 보내느라 바빠서 너가 자신의 사춘기를 받아들일 준비가 되어있지 않았다는 말이 많이 와닿았어.
모든 사람들에게서 노력하는 아이라는 수식어를 얻는 사람이 되는건 정말 어려운 일이야 마크야. 넌 그걸 성공했고. 난 너가 그 수식어와 너의 사춘기를 맞바꾸었다고 생각해. 정말 잘해주고 있으니까 아프지말고 건강하고 너가 하고싶은 음악 마음껏 하면 시즈니들은 그것만으로도 행복하다는걸 알아줬으면 좋겠어.

@namuo.o,"네가 가지고 있는 생각이나 고민들을 대중이나 팬에게 숨김없이 말한다는 건 정말 많은 고민과 용기가 필요했을 텐데 이렇게 얘기해줘서 정말 고마워. 덕분에 어떤 생각을 가지고 이 노래를 만들었으며 무슨 생각을 하며 마크가 살아가는지 조금은 알 수 있게 되었어. 네가 가지고 있는 생각을 우리에게 공유해줘서 고마워. 
네가 누구보다 노력하고 얼마나 성실한지 잘 아는데 지금의 네가 되기까지 보이든, 보이지 않든 엄청난 노력을 한 게 느껴져서 너무 고맙기도 하면서 한편으로는 조금 마음이 아팠어. 인터뷰 중에 '데뷔를 하고 나서 사춘기를 겪었다.'는 그 말이 진짜 속상했어. 그 어린 나이에 그 작은 어깨가 책임져야 할 것이 얼마나 많았을지를 생각하니 지금까지 잘 견뎌준 네가 참 대단하고 멋진 사람이라는 걸 새삼 다시 한 번 깨닫게 되는 순간이야. 드림의 대장으로서, 127의 한 멤버로서 그 외의 활동으로 바쁘고 힘들어서 어디에다 네 마음 털어 놀 곳이 없었을 텐데 ,, 
그걸 노래로, 작사를 하며 이 방법만으로 네 마음을 뿜어 낼 수 밖에 없었다는 사실에 안타까우면서도 그렇게 잘 성장해줘서 그리고 지금 그 결과를 우리에게 보여줘서 고맙다는 말 밖에 할 말이 없네.. 진짜 고마워 고맙다는 말을 너무 많이 해서 진심이 아닌것 같이 느껴지겠지만 정말 고마워. :) 

맞아, 마크야 너는 평범한 24살의 청년이야. 물론 '가수'라는, '연예인'이라는 타이틀을 가지고 살아가야 하지만, 그 전에 넌 그냥 보통의 한 아이의 마음을 가지고 있는 사람이란 걸 잊지마. 그러니 너는 누구보다 너를 아껴주고 너를 가장 많이 사랑해주렴. 그래서 너에게서 넘쳐 흐르는 사랑을 우리에게, 더불어 주변에 베풀어주렴. 사랑은 원래 가지고 있는 것을 주는 게 어니라 본인에게 넘쳐 흘러나오는 거라고 하니깐. 그러니까 누구보다 스스로를 많이 사랑해주렴. 나도 날 많이 사랑해서 넘치는 사랑을 너에게 배푸는 거니까.

정말 마크야. 작년 한해 너무 수고 많았고, 고마워. 덕분에 나도 행복한 한 해를 보냈어. 정말 너무 고마워. 항상 우리를 생각해주는 그 마음. 고마워 이번 해도 건강하고 행복하고 멋있는 한 해 보내자!

@퍼렁-d7c,뭔가 마크라는 사람은 내가 짐작하는 것보다 훨씬 깊고 넓은 내면을 가지고 있는 것 같다 항상 잘하고 또 잘하기에 마크 자신이 가지고 있는 걱정 고민들을 조금씩 우리에게 내비칠 때마다 놀라면서도 팬인 나는 마크 너를 더 오래오래 곁에서 응원하고 싶게 돼  그냥 너의 이야기를 듣는게 너어무 좋다 음악으로든 글로든 이런 인터뷰든 그냥 좋다! 마크 너의 여정을 오래 오래 지켜보고 싶어. 결국 어느 순간에는 반드시 너가 원하는 모든 것들이 결실을 맺고 이루어질 거라는 걸 우리는 모두 알아 그러니 우리 같이 가보자 !!,15,2022-02-15T11:58:35Z

@m.e.8095,"mark really suffered since a young age , debuting in a young age in multiple unit , giving up his teenage age that everyone dream of , stress thinking if he was doing right  if he deserves that love that we give him , knowing if he did his best some ppl will come at him , trying to think positive all the time for us , thinking who is he to the ppl around him if he is nice to the world , the voice telling him he isn't doing enough , mark is a special person , for me mark helped me a lot , i take his world seriously because if you think about he is right , his mindset is special i have never saw someone like  him , i thought that ppl like him are in 80 but mark at young age with this mindset is a miracle fr , no matter what i will always support him <3

Mark has really wrote a song that depicts everything he feel at the moment. His worries, many worries where shown in this song and it hurts so much. But I'm happy to see Mark being brave to share this masterpiece to all of us. He let us know how he felt being at the stage of adolescence. A song that he has given to us that contains his whole being not only as an idol but also as a person who also had a lot of worries to take.

Mark Lee, I want you to know that all your hard work has paid off. You had put a lot of effort every single moment of your life no matter what you do. Being in different units/groups and not almost having enough rest but still made a song and give it to all his fans is really a MARK LEE THING. You've did great Mark.

@riaquatic,"Mark Lee, thank you for sharing with us your thoughts and vulnerabilities - it really makes me think, like wow, you’re really just like any other person, you’re like me, like any of us. 

We all have our own struggles, our fights, and our own devils - it’s an ongoing battle with yourself and it could get lonely. I just wanted to say, for me, you have brought me some joy, laughter, some light in this dark tunnel - and I could not thank you enough for that. I hope that our (the fans’) love and support for you can be a small source of strength for you in your battle. 

I hope you’ll keep on going, even if little steps at a time, I’ll keep on going with mine too. I hope that we will reach the destination we’re respectively aiming for, no matter how long the journey.

I just wanted to thank you again for sharing this, there is some comfort in knowing that there may be someone out there who may be experiencing what I am experiencing - it helps with the loneliness a bit.

I’ll always be wishing for your happiness and all the other good things for you Mark Lee! I hope you’ll love yourself and accept yourself and be yourself a bit more every day! :)",1,2022-02-15T11:38:00Z

Hopefully may he be filled with lots of love and support around him and fill all the lonely holes within him. 

I know to myself I'm not in the position to mention this but hopefully may he love his self more. May he see himself in the loving eyes of others so he can recognize how great he is 💚💚😊😊

특히 불 꺼진 방에서 천장을 바라보며 나를 갉아먹는 시간을 악몽이라고 표현한 게 나는 공감이 참 많이 되더라 낮에는 웃고 살아도 말이야 나도 날마다 밤엔 악몽을 되풀이하곤 해서... 그 마음을 알거든
마크야 너는 내가 좋아한 사람 가운데 가장 신념이 뚜렷하고 그 영향이 선한 사람이야 마크를 이루는 모든 것들을 내가 전부 이해해보고 싶어질 만큼 좋아해

I really loved the song, and I love it still. I'm glad that I got to listen to it when I'm going through my last teenage years.the last part where ge said he would tell his younger self to love himself that's really beautiful. tbh as a introvert and an overthinker loving myself was a struggle, I didn't know something like loving yourself even existed. but in the past 2 years getting to know kpop world listening to songs about self love, reading books made me realise so many things. and yes I can really relate. Also where he said, that in his eyes he's not a nice guy, I felt that. yeah.

차일드가 발매되었던 날에도, 오늘 이 영상을 보면서도 마크가 얼마나 속이 깊고 생각이 많은 사람인지 다시금 깨닫게 되는 것 같아 
재작년 여름부터 작년까지 나는 내 인생에서 제일 힘든 시기를 보냈는데 그 때 마크를 알게 되고, 엔시티를 알게 되어서 참 다행이라는 생각을 항상 해 너희들을 만나고 끝이 나지 않을 것만 같던 밤이 제법 잠들만해졌으니까
불면증으로 1년 넘게 고생하고 약을 먹던 와중에 마크가 인스타에 올렸던 불면증에 관한 글을 보고 정말 공감했었는데, 뭐랄까,, 요즘은 이렇게 내가 너희들을 보면서 위로 받는 게 오히려 너희들의 일부를 갉아먹고 있는 게 아닐까? 하는 걱정도 들기도 해
생각이 꼬리에 꼬리를 물고 이어지네 ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋ
암튼! 마크의 악몽이 날아가버렸으면 좋겠다 물론 그 지루한 밤들은 우리를 성장시키기도 하지만 말이야 ㅎㅎ 
마크야 너가 무엇을 하든, 어떤 노래를 들고 나와서 세상을 놀라게 하든, 어떤 춤을 대중들에게 보여주든,
늘 같은 자리에서 너를 사랑해줄 사람들이 있다는 걸 알아줘어

Mark was being so honest here ..i mean, he always is of course ..but this time he was wearing his heart on his sleeve.. i could relate to so many things he talked about and it was so awesome of him that he actually did talk about them coz not everyone is able to/wants to
Especially from this part on @9:25 .."" i think and talk to myself a lot .."" and how he said he thinks he has a lot of problems but knows them well coz he can see himself from an outside pov , 13:15 how he's always stuck inside his head , how he keeps thinking about who he is in the eyes of other people , how everyone is just lonely sometimes and just want someone's help and how he would have gone a lot deeper but still kept it okay to not worry the people around him i guess.. so so so relatable !

@yukasketch,"So interesting to hear his more in-depth thoughts about the process and intentions behind the song. It was also so wonderful to hear him talk about it in Englidh. Child is very meaningful and I was honestly surprised for this kind of sound to come out from him and that SM allowed it, because his ""persona"" on screen is very bright, funny, hard-working, good-behaved boy, and now we saw a very different side of him. And it is so nice to learn this about him. I guess I saw some very brief glimpses of this side of him in some random conversations with Johnny, but it was a momentary thing and they always change the mood back to a goofy one quickly.
In any case, congratulations Mark, looking forward to more songs from you 💚",0,2022-02-15T11:25:11Z

@채은-q8k,아 진짜 다 봤는데... 말이 안나온다... 마크야 너는 어떻게... 넌 내가 생각했던 것보다 더 깊은 사람이었구나. 네가 그 수많은 스케줄을 소화하며 지금 이 자리까지 올라올 수 있었던 건 몇번이고 질문하고 또 생각했던 그 밤들 때문이었겠다... 근데 있잖아 마크야. 이거 하나만 알려주고싶다 넌 지금 그 자리에 있다는 것만으로도 평범한 아이가 아니야. 남들은 쉽게 할 수 없는 걸 넌 이뤄냈잖아... 넌 진짜 니가 생각하는 것보다 훨씬 더 대단한 child야. 아무튼... 내가 할 수 있는 일은 마크가 작사를 하면서 걸어갈 여정들을 응원하는 것밖엔 없네! 마크가 마크를 사랑하는 과정들을 나도 옆에서 지켜보고 응원할게. 너무너무 사랑해 마크야!,1,2022-02-15T11:20:43Z

@ealdryno,"It's unfair right Mark? 😊 When we're just a simple speck's of entity yet the whole universe seems pushing us to grasp the star and be on the moon without any rocket or scientific way, and work on a magical assumption without any miracle. We're totally spent to the point where rebellious seems to be a force of nature that surging from our side in order to reach those adolescent  stage. World can easily say ""be strong, you're the best"" , i know those phrases but to be standing on those moments where we're in our total piece of humanity as wholesome... Its breath taking thoughts. Literally breath taking...  
There's only like 10% of real us in our pages while 90% were all about those massive amount of judgment and decision from the whole realm... 
I was just a child when the world demand me to be more brighter than the stars amongst Apollo chariot. 
I was just a child too when I've witnessed the downfall of my happiness
And I was just a child too when I can't do something for myself in order to make the other happy. Been keeping those whole facts in this heart of mine for 25 years. Till now tho. 

I felt those burdening burnt, it's a damn maddening journey yet reaching this destination in my career as well, a happy ending with permanent nightmares. I am that spent...
 I really love your song Mark. It's one part of me too. Not being selfish or delusional  but most of your lyrical content there, that's me also.
