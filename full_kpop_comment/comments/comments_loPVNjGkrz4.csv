@sonalisamal2009,Hit is definitely one of the most difficult choreography of Seventeen. The way it's so fast paced and they are totally looking like one unit/entity is super cool. They totally deserve the title of synchronisation kings. Every member is so good that  all of them can pass off as the main dancer. The song is catchy. Jun's moves were so clean. I was totally gaping at Jeonghan and The8's individual parts. They were so fluid in their movements. The part where they  (Jeonghan and The8) sort of did a duet and then Jeonghan continued it with Seungkwan (I think) was so stunning. I absolutely love this performance. Seventeen for the win ❤,21,2023-11-07T11:05:55Z

Seventeen also deserve attention, this group is the BEST.  From vocal, rap, performance, nice personality and even visual they had it all. I'm a new CARAT, it took me a month to finished watching their variety shows, mv's, dance practice and etc. And I'm proud to say that I stan a right group, nope right group is not the right term, it is the BEST group. From this day on, I promise that I will support this group no matter what, I'm a multi and I'm not regretting that I chose to be a CARAT.",11,2020-12-15T13:44:32Z

@gummy3092,"who did the legendary chorus the best.(my opinion) just an opinion. no judging.
1. Jun : You knew this coming right?. His was the most satisfying to watch.
2. Hoshi : As expected our main dancer and choreographer.
3. Dino : And our another main dancer.( it was really hard to choose between hoshi and dino.)
4. Woozi : He is already good at singing, producing and dancing. what this man cannot do?
5. Minghao: Our lead dancer did pretty good.
6. Vernon: He did it like it was nothing.
7. Wonwoo: I'm surprised he did really good.
8. Mingyu: It was not that bad.
9. Dokyeom: He was busy singing but still did very good.
10. Joshua: I like how he tried his best.

@hotaru2020,"June 2020 thoughts:

They never cease to impress me. Every Seventeen members are genuinely talented and that's what makes people afraid of recognizing them. SVT has so much potential that people becomes afraid of the possibility that their own idols will be overshined, thus, they make themselves believe that Seventeen is just like any other boy group.

@shinra_xx1,"0:54-0:57 (pre chorus) I think this is the only part of the choreo I can make but still looks like about to fail miserably, but the original choreo is actually far more complicated.
1:16-1:23 (post-chorus) this part is really interesting and eye-catching (for me personally) because they move forward and dancing at the same time which looks really hard because if I make that footwork omg, I would wall immediately, but again the original choreo is harder. The original moves require more energy (on my opinion) and contain a lot complicated moves.
Can you guys imagine it, I mean SVT change the choreo to a simpler one (because I think if they do the original one, I'm afraid they'll not be able to breath) but we still we cannot do it. 🤣😂. (This all is based on my opinion please don't hate me)",0,2020-05-09T13:08:01Z

@luvvvv124,Probably one of their most dynamic choreos yet. Each transition makes so much sense. I love how when some members have lines around the same time they all do the different choreo from the rest of the group and after their part they gracefully transition into the dance with the rest of the boys. The killing part has to be when the group walks off and the 2nd group charges in during the chorus . Ugh I love them.,1,2019-08-31T01:09:38Z

@xiumin6823,"*Appreciation Comment for Boo Seungkwan:*

Carats already have that habit to count all the members all the time to ensure all members are in the video. Because my love for Seungkwan is great, I noticed something.

You will notice from the start that he was not in the dancing, he only enters in his part which is a duet with Jeonghan and dance up until the before the 2nd Break dance start. You will noticed he exits naturally with the help of Vernon for him not to be caught exiting. And he enters again in 3:15 after the break dance with a jump for us not to notice him that much.

Because of his ankle injury he couldnt participate fully in the Choreo because it has lots of Jumping around and plus the hard footworks - but I am happy he is really working hard and devoted in what he wants.

Please appreciate our Boo more. He is more than just a comedian in the group. Thank you for reading ❤

@ziiviolet,"One of my favorite things about Seventeen is that they allow each member to be recognized for how great they are. It's very common in K-pop for a group to just have a ""visual"" or ""center"" and just make them the focus of every comeback. But seventeen allows different members to be showcased in different eras whether it be Hoshi during the clap era or Jun during Hit. I love it because ultimately it allows the group to feel like it's comprised of multiple individuals instead of just one individual and then ""the rest"". And you can tell based on how strong each members individual fandom is along with the overall Carat family. And for that I'm glad to be a Carat 😊!",0,2019-08-11T19:27:01Z

PS: It's a given fact that all of them can dance but when you look at the Performance Team, you very well know why they're the dance unit. Little things like head tilts, hand and leg angles, jumps, and all that stuff, PT is doing it with much details and extra energy.",0,2019-08-11T19:18:37Z

@seungkwanism,"as a musical actor it’s so extremely strenuous on not only his vocal cords but his body and mind as well so dokyeom not having lines probably is the best decision because human tend to get extremely sick after HECTIC ACTIVITIES are over because we can finally REST but some dk stans really said fuck dk vocal cords and still want him to sing. Honestly, him still participating in this comeback and learned this mindblown choreo has done so much. It his own will and we will respect that. And I am beyond proud of him.",0,2019-08-11T09:03:27Z
