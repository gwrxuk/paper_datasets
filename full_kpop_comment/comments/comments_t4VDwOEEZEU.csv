They’re getting exposure and that’s a good thing but to insult an award show and bring negative vibes to it. That’s not beneficial for anyone.

I don't understand why so many Armys try to underestimate the Grammys, which, whether we like it or not, are very important in the music industry and in which the BTS members themselves have shown interest. But when we call them scamys, we are implying that if one day they were to win it, it would not be a significant achievement or it would be as a consequence of a scam. I think we have to be very careful with the terms we use. I understand that many think that inviting or nominating them is only to attract viewers, but have you seen how many superstars don’t win awards and still proudly perform? I understand that many of us feel frustrated because it ends up being an award aimed mainly at the American market and little takes other languages ​​and countries into account. We Latinos know this well, and in the midst of frustration, it led Latin artists to have the terrible idea of ​​creating the Latin Grammys, which for many years meant marginalizing them from the ""big awards."" I think we just should support BTS and hope that they achieve all their goals, including the Grammy they have mentioned so many times.",8,2024-10-10T04:44:43Z,,2

It is obvious they work hard for it. I think it is awful when we, as their fan base, say they don't need one. It invalidates what they are working towards. Two years ago, the rules changed to where any voting member can vote in the final round (no more committee). That includes the people they work and collaborate  with. If I was a voting member who wasn't necessarily a fan, I would say, ""Well, since you don't think they need one, gonna go ahead and vote for someone else."" Has anyone ever stopped to think if we might be indirectly contributing to the result? We don't know by what margin they have lost the vote. We are assuming it is a landslide or behave as if that is the case, but it might not be. I wondered if part of why this one means so much to them is because we can not get this award for them. I do wish the Grammy organization would show the number result of the votes for the sake of transparency. By the way,  the PDF rulebook is actually on the Grammy Website and accessible to anyone to read. Maybe if we as a collective understand the rules, we can bring change to the Grammy. Sitting here, Scammy this, and Scammy that isn't going to help anything. It can only harm. It certainly doesn't put good energy towards what our guys are trying to accomplish.

K Pop is new to the western award shows. Yes I know they have been at out award show and have won. But Grammy's aren't a fan voted award show. There are many great artist that have never won a Grammy. It's not to blame American's. I really don't know how they come to there decisions. But like I said there are many artist that are bigger than BTS that have never won one.  Sorry if you feel that way about Americans. You know something we are always put down because people from other countries don't like Americans. But if their country falls into some issues in their country then they turn to America for help. Always want our money but always quick to put us down. I have just come to realize I don't want to be an Army anymore. I'll like BTS but I'm done with you selfish group of people.
