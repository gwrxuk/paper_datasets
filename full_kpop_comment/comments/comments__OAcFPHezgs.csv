Not only is Doyoung being patient with Jisung, but he also encourages him every step of the way, and Jisung is clearly given a boost by Doyoung's kind words.

@VyMauricio,"I didn’t expect that this would be as chaotic as it would be. Taeil and Jungwoo were hilarious!

Doyoung and Jisung were so cute because they’re so gentle and Doyoung tells Jisung that he’s doing well from time to time.

Taeyong and Yuta were like opposites because Taeyong seemed so excited and fired up, especially about the penalty, while Yuta was quite calm. It was sweet how Taeyong gutted the shrimp for Yuta because he couldn’t touch them.",1505,2022-04-21T16:08:02Z

I also wonder if they had a choice in the dish selections. Otherwise, why would Taeyong choose a shrimp dish if he knew Yuta couldn’t touch them? I assume Yuta is allergic to shrimp?

I also love how excited Jungwoo was to give out the penalties - his disappointment when it was moot for Yuta. 
Same with Taeyong - how excited he was at the thought of messing Doyoung’s team up but how deflated he looked when DY brushed it off 🤣🤣",15,2022-04-21T15:50:55Z

My Heart's NCT 127 Ultimates Yuta y Taeyong, My Heart's Bros NCT 127 Jungwoo, Taeil y Doyoung, mi NCT Dream Jisung the Brazilian Czennie aquí se divirtió viendo este video, y espero con ansias la continuación. Y una cosa más acerté con tu comparación con los personajes de mi Anime favorito hasta ahora, los Caballeros del Zodíaco (el 7 NCT Dream con los 7 Guerreros Dioses de Asgard y el 7 NCT 127 [ Aparte de Mark y Haechan porque ya comparado con el G.D.A] con los 7 Generales Marinos de Poseidón), basado en la personalidad de cada uno de ustedes similar a los de los Personajes de Anime, Shotaro y Sungchan los comparé con los personajes Guardian Specters of the Champs Elysees en el anime, Hypnos & Thanatos, y mis Heart's Bros de WayV (los Diez siendo mi Heart's Ultimate) Quería conseguir 7 espectros de Hades entre los 108 espectros que tenían la personalidad similar a mis Heart's angels Bros de WayV, es complicado, sin algunos quieres para unirme a esta cosa o cualquier otro Czennies / WayZennies que vino a ver este anime también, quiere ayudarme también, acepto, gracias !!!!!!!

내 마음의 NCT 127 Ultimates 유타와 태용, 내 마음의 형들 NCT 127 정우, 태일과 도영, 내 NCT 드림 지성 여기 있는 브라질리언 시즈니가 즐겁게 이 영상을 보았고, 앞으로도 계속 기대된다. 그리고 지금까지 내가 가장 좋아하는 애니메이션의 캐릭터인 Knights of the Zodiac(The 7 NCT Dream with the 7 Warriors Gods of Asgard and the 7 NCT 127)와 비교하여 내가 옳았던 것 중 하나가 더 있습니다. W.G.A]와 포세이돈 7명의 해병대장과 비교), 애니메이션 캐릭터인 쇼타로와 성찬과 비슷한 각자의 개성을 바탕으로 애니메이션 속 샹젤리제의 가디언 스펙터 캐릭터와 비교해봤습니다. WayV의 Hypnos & Thanatos, 그리고 My Heart's Bros (The Ten은 My Heart's Ultimate) WayV의 My Heart's Angels Bros와 성격이 비슷한 108명의 유령 중 7명의 하데스의 유령을 구하고 싶었습니다. 복잡해서 원하는 게 없어요. 이 애니를 보러 와주신 다른 시즈니들/웨이제니들과 함께 하기 위해 저도 도움이 되었으면 하는 바램으로 받아들입니다 감사합니다!!!!!!!!!",1,2022-04-21T15:19:31Z

@mariareginatagalog243,Jisung used to runaway when jaemin asked him to do the dishes but now he is trying his best to independently do cooking task. This somehow makes me feel proud of him. I am also thankful that Doyoung did not pressure jisung and keep telling him that his doing great. Even support his silly chopping performance not telling him to make everything fast because they only have limited time to cook. I really appreciate his mom like patience  towards Jisung. I think Jisung will learn how to cook if doyoung teach him. Jisung need a teacher like him.,0,2022-04-21T14:00:10Z
@melanie3906,"OMG I love Jungwoo as an MC, he’s so crazy random but in an adorably giant puppy way. He literally makes every NCT content so much funnier.

Also I love how Doyoung is so patient and supportive of Jisung even though he’s super distracted and confused. If this was any NCT 127 member he’d probably be yelling at them cause he’s so competitive (out of love of course) but him encouraging Jisung to just do his own thing really goes to show how much NCT Dream are his babies 🥺",49,2022-04-21T14:00:10Z
