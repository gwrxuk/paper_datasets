If he was lipsyncing, you wouldn’t be able to see him take a DEEP breath before singing with DK. Just watch SK’s back-you can clearly see it. And then, when he comes across the camera for a millisecond, you can see it on his face. A masterpiece 👏",175,2023-02-07T19:58:09Z

I got really happy when i watched this because it reminded me of the countless amount of times these boys inspired me and made me happy with their songs and ofc GoSe, I've been in the fandom since the Aju Nice era and im just so glad to see where they are now!! :"")))) 

sorry for this rant but i really love seventeen and want to say thank you to them for being such an inspiration in my life <333

@francoisforever,"damn, the simplicity of this stage though. minimal stage props and decorations, almost muted colored outfits and only one set. Yet their maturity and professionalism jumps out at you almost immediately. No need for flashy or ground-breaking camera work and bling, instead they utilized their greatest asset: their performance and charisma. The lighting also played a big part on the whole thing, making everything look aesthetically pleasing. The outfits were downright simple (Mingyu was only wearing a collared shirt and brown pants for goodness sake!😂) but suited their entire theme overall. What's even more impressive is that this was for the western audience, so you'd think they'd go extravagant but no. This is them, showing the market their core strength as a team, which is coordination, choreography, vocals, and performance without the distraction of over the top outfits, props and stage set. And I'd take that any day over any other performance.",37,2021-08-15T05:59:14Z

In the 1st and 3rd ones, they put deep and soft voice together, while the 2nd chorus is the harmonization between Jun, Jeonghan and The8 - they all have soft voice which makes the chorus sounds more delicate and serene.",508,2021-06-24T18:43:07Z

@vnree,"I rly like the sequence around this part 1:15 

mingyu ended it. the lights dim down, some stuff got taken out from the song, it's a bit quieter now & sets up the next verse. vernon starts, the rest of them disperse & go into their positions, the spotlight shines on dino, alone during his part. the beat kinda picks up, more things get added in the song & the8 sings in such a heartfelt way about the *_feeling of his heart racing for the 1st time_* (which somehow kinda suits the song in terms of production too? idk, I put the explanation of what I'm thinking at the end in case anyone wants to read it, marked w an asterisk (*)). we cut back to mingyu, coming in pretty strong w his verse. as if he's now sure that this feeling that he's experiencing is truly love, he declares: *_'cause you are my escape_* & says *_just need you to be ready,_* bcs he's finally decided--firm in his decision to pursue love. joshua takes the center, followed by all the other members. *_ready to love_* starts

*the 1st time you fell in love w someone, your heart races (similar to how the beat picks up), you feel a lot of things & you're probably experiencing a lot of things for the 1st time as well (some more instruments/effects got added into the song if I understand correctly?)

this could be me just kinda reaching & trying to make sense of it all, but tbh it's just fun & interesting to think ab the song as a story, as well as see what's going on w the production & try to see how it suits the song. I feel like svt does this rly well",0,2021-06-24T16:33:32Z

@purpleswan_leo,"i really loved the concept of them being under constant spotlight and performing (without any regrets). i guess they translated 'loving someone' to loving/enjoying performing (which is their job). adding meaning to their work is giving them the purpose. which, i respect!
i really like how they gave individual spotlight to certain members. 
the whole performance screams seventeen! i love it!
