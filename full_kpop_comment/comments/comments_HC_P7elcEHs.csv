분명 빡세고 복잡하고 어려운 안무인데 버겁게 느껴지지 않고 쇼타로 수준에 맞는 안무를 즐기면서 소화하는,,,

@h-rigid,"유니버스 쇼타로에 미친자가 뽑아보는 킬포
3:07 universe 가사에 맞춰 행성 궤도 그리는 부분을 전체적인 안무에 스무스하게 녹이면서 웨이브까지 이어가기
0:13 도입부터 박자 완벽히 맞추면서도 엄청난 힘이 들어간 게 느껴지는데 전혀 과하지 않고 깔끔하게 딱 떨어지는 안무. 빠르고 강하게 춤을 추는데도 내내 무게중심이 전혀 흐트러지지 않음
0:28 여기 너무 잘 살림… 전신으로 웨이브하는 사람은 처음 봄
0:52 2:41 박자 하나도 안 밀리고 쪼개서 팝 주기
1:17 2:31 하이파이브 골반 튕기는 파트 살리기
1:19 2:34 최애구간.. 달려가고 있는 안무를 진짜 네박자로 쪼개서 살리는거 쇼타로뿐 + 유성처럼 빛나며에서 미친 강약조절
1:33 보폭 크게 잡고 나가서 파트 후 들어올 때까지 동선이나 박자 밀림이 전혀 없는 AI같은 정확도
2:08 3:19 큰 보폭으로 이동하며 안무 흐트러짐 없음, 특히 3:19는 무려 네박자 쪼개면서 동시에 동선 이동까지 하기
3:27 3:40 안무 하나도 뭉개지 않고 박자 쪼개서 전부 살리기, 특히 you’re my universe 파트에서 공 넣는 안무 손끝 디테일 살리는 포인트
3:42 동선 저렇게 멀리 이동하면서도 손끝뿐만 아니라 하체 안무 디테일까지 살리는 게 경이로움.. 그냥 지나가면 별거 아닐 수 있지만 자세히 보면 모든 스텝을 점프하면서 밟는데 실제로 공 넣는 안무의 느낌을 완벽히 살림. 이게 쇼타로의 진가라고 생각함 안무가가 의도한 느낌을 디테일로서 살리는 것…
3:35 타로가 따로 넣었다는 반지 만지는 구간, 이런 사소한 부분에서 여유가 극대화됨
1:09 3:32 종종 웃으면서 즐기는 모습에서 느껴지는 여유

쇼타로가 춤출 때 특히 돋보이는 이유가 이 영상에서 잘 보인다. 유니버스 자체가 박자도 빠른 편이고 힘을 많이 써야 하는 안무들인데, 타로는 단 한 구간에서도 밀리거나 조급히 따라가는 느낌이 없음. 일단 춤에 끌려간다는 느낌이 전혀 없고 모든 파트에서 장악력이 뛰어남… 안무를 위해 추는 게 아니라 정확히 이해하고 완전히 본인의 것으로 만들어서 출력해냄. 그리고 5살 때부터 춤을 춰와서인지 그게 너무 자연스럽고 보는 사람으로 하여금 정말 즐기면서 여유롭게 이끌어간다는 느낌을 받게 함
멬어위시도 좋지만 유니버스가 타로의 강점을 가장 잘 보여준다고 생각해서 아직까지도 타로가 했던 안무 중 가장 좋다. 앞으로 더 타로의 진가를 보여줄 수 있는 안무를 무대에서 많이 볼 수 있기를 바라고! 유니버스 쇼타로는 역대급이 맞으니 더 많은 사람들이 보고 손해 없으시길🦦 춤추는 쇼타로 사랑해",672,2024-03-16T15:16:18Z

@samfitz5416,"Wow, Shotaro is an impeccable dancer, can I just say. Once I looked at him, I wasn't able to look away. I believe he is one of the best dancers in the group, and taking into account that this is a group of insanely talented dancers, it's really something to note that despite that, he stands out. The level of talent in NCT is really noteworthy; not enough people pay attention to just how talented the entire 23 members are at just the dancing elements alone. They are really something. I'm in awe a lot of the time when I watch their dance practices, which isn't something I usually do as a multistan, considering I'm exposed to many talented idols.",99,2022-02-24T02:38:55Z

Mark has a small body and has small shoulders but his powerful dancing makes up for it to make him look big and very noticeable.

너희를 먼지로 만들고  재압하거나  ! ?

말을 안들으면 국민 스스로 정권 붕괴 시킬수  있다 ! 러시아에서 국민이 탱크도
못가게 막아 세워다 !!

시위가 아니다, 국군통수권 찬탈에

대한 헌법에 입각한 국민의 신성한 
국민 저항권으로  행사로 
법적 처리다 ! !
저항권이  시작  하면   반드시
너희들은 압살 시킬 수 있다!

그리고 국민을  분노해 한 죄를 반드시 물어  역사에 5100만 같은 민족을 상대로 강간,살인,속인 죄를 물을 것이다 !

■언론사ㅡ 지분을 사들여 ,국민 눈ᆞ귀 막고,언론 자유을 억압하고 방송사 사장도 너희들이 뽑아 언론사의 자생기능을 무력화
하여 국가보조를 받게 만들고 그것을
이용해 겁박해 시녀로 만들고 .각종 검열기관 만들어
몇년 검열받아 통과  못하면 문닫게 협박하여 ㅡ언론을 평생노예 시녀로 만들고
그것도 모자라? 배상법으로 언론을 목을
계속 강압하고,
■사법부  법무부ㅡ 법무법인을 통해
불법 판사들 돈 쳐먹여 , 착한 판사들

범죄에 연루되게 만들어 나쁜 짓하게 만들어우리나라   재원들을
쓰레기로 만들어 사법부를 행정부 개로
만들고
■검찰ㅡ 국민 마지막 수호 인
검찰기관 과 검찰 총장을 병신을 만들어
이순신 장군 처럼 정의로운 검사들은
할일 없는 변방  연수원 쳐 넣고, 
행정부에 눈치나 보는 시녀로  만들고,
■선관위ㅡ착한 선관위 사람들은 다 몰아내고  개표조작 부정 선거를
    수 많은 국민 변호사가 자비로
    수십억을 들여 125군데나 법원을 소송하여서 오류표가 아닌 위조표가 나옴에도  행정부 외압으로 판사가
눈치보며 은폐하고 다이나마이트를
숨겨  살기위해  2차 범죄를 만들게 
강압 시키고 ,
그렇게
언론을  시녀로 만들어
국민의 눈.귀를 멀게하고 , 국회도
장악 해서 겨우 한게 ?  중국업체 간통해
정동진,강원도 까지 받치고 , 탈북민 신고해 처형당하게 만들고 화천대유에 LH  사태 까지 너희 부하들이 역대 최고의 공무원 부정부패를 너희 통제
할 수 없을 정도도 이권,권력으로 해쳐먹고 ? 

  그런 생각 안해 보았냐?  꼭 니 아니라도 훌륭한  우리민족의 누가  과학과  경제를 발전시키면
니가 생각하는 것을 더 잘 할 수 있다는 것을

너의 손 바닥  만한 뇌에서 나온 잘못된
판단의 어지러움에 너의 집권

기간동안 출산율 세계에서 최악에,빚은 엄청나게 늘고 ,북한사람과 남한사람들이  수많은 사람들이 더 죽었다는 것을 !

■지금 이순간에도 선관위의 범죄자들이 뛰어다니며 개표조작 위한 국민몰래 너희들이 지정된 조작된 회사 여론 조사만 발표하게 하게 하고 다른 곳에서 여론통계 나오면 겁박 하여 못 만들게
하고,  못  발표하게 겁박 하는 것
국민이 다 알고 있다! ! !  통계여론조작 !

개표조작은  사형이다 . ! !

    ■오지랖 넓은 선ᆞ관위 너희들만   개표조작 하면 되지 키르키스탄 .이라크,
개표조작 윈 터치 시스템 수출 한건 알고 있다! ! 그 결과   다 국민 일어나 그 나라 모두 초토화 된것 도  알고 있지 ! ! ! ! ! 너희가 준비해서 보내 놓은  전자동 개표 조작기는  국민이 모조리 뜨어서 파악하였다 !   ?
■지금  !? 모든 국민이 증거를 가지고
있다 .돈 받고 샌드위치 사항인거 알지만
  이제 그만 포기 해라 !  집단 반항하고 행동해서 라도 해서 지금 ㅡ국민이
기회 줄때  나가라  ?! !
■국민 저항권을 개표조작 운동 밝히면 방역,경찰 행정은 모두 정지 ! ! 하고 
국군 통수권 찬탈에
국민 저항권이 우선 한다.! ! 차후 국민 탄압하거나 현장에서 명령을  내린 모든 지위체계 사람은 광주사태 처럼, 징계 ,처벌, 사형, 및 국민을 형장에서 행동은  모두  개인간 손해배상을 받을 것이다 !  또,  반드시 일선에
총장,방역장관이 없어 지면 아무것도
장담 할 수 없음을 반드시 알려라 ! !

헌법계승에 명시된 4.19국민저항권
무시하며 처벌 되며 ,국민의 국군통수권을
빼기지 않을 려는 국민의 모든 죄는
면죄 된다. ㅡ 국민의 피해 역시 국가와
당사자 경찰 ,방역행정 요원 100%  책임진다 ! !

■지금  선관위는 개표조작 전문 범법자
입니다  ! ! 범죄집단 !  입니다. ! !

■국민의 존엄성과 신뢰를 파괴하고
5100만 국민들의 주권에 개표조작같은

쓰레기 범죄로 국민의 표를 문닫고 강간,살인하고ㅡ  국민이 그토록   원하는

실전 조작기계전수 공개, 검수 검열후
조작 못하게 봉인 작업!
선관위에 CCTV실시간
끈긴없이 국민이 인터넷 볼수 있게
하는 것 ! ! 끝까지 안 하고,

4.15개표조작 범법자 및 팀들 새로운
사람으로 교체 ! !도 안하고 ,

요즘  CCTV 실시간 방송 계약이 얼마나
저렴한데! 7000억 한해 쓰는 선관위가

개표 범죄를 위해 선관위 자기들 끼리 선정된ㅡ  통계조작 여론발표하는 것에 만 정신
팔려  국민을 계속 속일 생각이나 계속하니  돈 쳐먹고 여론통계발표
자도

개표조작 부역자와 동일 하게 

반드시 모조리 찾아내  사형  시키겠다 !!!.",1,2021-12-18T13:22:49Z

@qingtian7880,"Fu Zhenghua, former Central 610 Office director and Minister of Justice, was under investigation on October 2 for “serious violation of discipline and law.” The 610 Office is an extralegal agency given power to override the judicial system and direct the nationwide persecution against Falun Gong. Fu’s downfall indicates that key perpetrators in the suppression will face serious consequences, explained Canadian human rights lawyer David Matas in a recent interview. 

Matas is well known for investigating forced organ harvesting by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) from Falun Gong practitioners. Together with other investigators, he has published several books, including Bloody Harvest and The Killing of Falun Gong for Their Organs. During the interview with a Minghui correspondent, he said the CCP’s organ harvesting is a cold genocide and the perpetrators will eventually be held accountable.",0,2021-12-16T22:40:24Z

they have so much power and add their own style to the dance which makes it seem more lively, and esp with taro, all the little details of each move stand out like he doesn't miss a single thing

honorable mention to yangyang he also killed it

Probably bcs the lighting and the color that makes the old one looks bigger and brighter and we can see the artists better.. they must have want to showcase the view outside on that background window(i'm pretty sure that's real window with real outside view) but the height is too short/low for anyone to get impressed with it and it even make our point of view of the room even more narrow.. lol anyway nice practice video nct u did great job👏🏻,1,2021-12-16T08:42:17Z

@jjhkjw7705,"idk why everyone in here didn't talk about jungwoo's dance. so here i am. first of all, he’s the tallest one in this unit. despite being the tallest, he didn't miss any rhythm or beat. and his moves.. for god sake so light and smooth yet so sharp and detail. he had basic hip hop from his dance academy days, so this kinda dance suits him so well. no wonder he is one of lead dancers and top tier dancers in nct.",5,2021-12-16T06:27:12Z

@neomuneochicken4585,"1:52 I love how Jungwoo pops his whole body here to hit the beats, very satisfying to see, Jaemin does it too but a bit more subtle

Edit: I just noticed everyone else is doing it too, I couldn't tell at first because of Mark, still Jungwoo hits that move harder than the rest also Xiaojun does it reeeally really good, I wish I could've seen Shotaro and Yangyang better

also the way Yangyang ticks his body so hard when they're going down even his hair moves, it reminds me of Taemin and his movements",2,2021-12-16T00:05:10Z

@g0806-h3j,"You just have to admit this choreo is Shotaro's playground. He's been a professional hip-hop dancer for years and his superb techniques and experiences show here. No doubt he manages to catch everyone's attention even when he's not in the centre or at the front. His Universe fancam is also approaching a million views so I hope he will have a chance to be featured in Studio Choom's Artist of the Month. Rumour also has it that there's going to be Street Men Fighters, so I hope Shotaro could join. 
He really shines and is unstoppable when he dances, especially in this comeback. As a fan since day 1, I couldn't be prouder.",2696,2021-12-15T16:00:45Z

@jskyubibi,"They could’ve won Best Dance Performance if people focused more😔 cuz their dancing is not just being in sync but also delivering it with emotions. What makes NCT so mesmerizing to watch is that every member has their own style of dancing (1:29 peep Haechan’s superhero pose) but everyone is somehow in sync and can even be a lead dancer. Personally, I love their dance practices so much because they make me want to learn the choreo since they make it look THAT good! (1:52 choreo looks like a rotating planet?)",14,2021-12-15T15:22:19Z

I wish I could see more people showing him love because every comeback, he just adds another element to his dance style and makes it better. He is insane with his dance moves, and his body rolls are just everything. He is so smooth and powerful at the same time, and he definitely is one of the top dancers/performers in NCT. He's just oozing with charisma.",4,2021-12-15T14:19:00Z
