@cc_faith,"Onces, check out ONCEasONE_ on twitter for goals for Twice’s next comeback. Once fanbases on Twitter have worked together to set a goal of 40 million Youtube views in the first 24 hours. Whether you think it’s too high or low, please do your absolute best anyway since this will be Twice’s second full album and their 5th anniversary. Our fandom has grown and we have also become more united and stronger especially during Choeaedol voting. Remember to stream log-in, manually search the comeback title plus “twice” so it appears in more people’s searches, watch the video in at least 480p, do not pause or change speed, do not use incognito mode, do not mute, do not clear history and cache, no multiple tabs, do not loop the comeback song, don’t use playlists within the first 24 hours, watch 2-3 random videos between the comeback video. You could watch other Twice videos, cute animal videos, whatever you like just make sure you mix up these videos each time so it’s not considered bot behaviour so your views can get counted. Anyway please share this with all the onces you know, let’s work hard!",1,2020-10-04T10:12:06Z

@tomlin1312,"2:29 子瑜好像開玩笑地自嘲自己是垃圾桶😅,而且命中娜璉的笑穴 ! 3:16 Mina提到馬鈴薯眼,關於馬鈴薯,對烹飪外行的我曾看過一則新聞說,發芽的馬鈴薯有毒,高溫也不易去除,最好不要食用,詳情可參考網站:「馬鈴薯發芽有毒,但只要削去芽眼再充分煮熟,就沒問題?(health.udn.com＞元氣網＞養生)」; 3:25 蜘蛛網好像有封印的作用😅(除非是永遠在另一道門進出) ; 3:49 frying trap似形容煎蛋發出的聲音(trap本義為捕獸器,陷阱,後其中之一引申為爵士音樂的打擊樂器,或是從美國亞特蘭大發跡的一種嘻哈說唱藝術 - -以上參考自網路) ; 4:29 生有漂亮大眼的代價(有報導指出大眼睛易遭侵襲...)😅,但眼不算大的我也有相同問題 ! 4:33 😂,不過,志效應該不在嘲諷定延不美,而奇怪的是,志效怎會剛好分配到怕被煙燻的工作呢😂 !?

@Natsukashi7,"If you look at @11:44, Dahyun had several letters written from each of the staff members. Of all of them she chose to read a specific one stating that ""you are always kind and caring towards the staff! But at times you look sad and I worry about you... When you're in a dark place, you can talk to us"". This really validates the theory I've always had of her. She seems to always be the one that's smiling the brightest/making people laugh which kind of shadows what she is really feeling inside which is usually the opposite. As private as she is, I hope one day she's able to be more open about her feelings/thoughts esp with her members so that she doesn't have to keep everything bottled up inside. She needs to be protected at all costs 😭",32,2020-09-05T03:09:15Z

for your cooking because MOMO kimchi stew
was just omg so tempting lol 😋

I almost cry together with Sana. She's so endearing♥️so lovable. The reading letter
part takes me back to The Private Life where
you 9 wrote to one another and cry together. That's very meaningful, unforgettable and irreplaceable.

I hope the 9 of you not only having some fun and healing time but take care. Eat well, rest well and sleep well.

Isn't not true. The reason for why the smoke was following up her face! Is that it was her ""BODY HEAT!"" Her body heat was ""attracting"" the smoke.
In the same way with magnets!.
I also like the end part, where the girls RECEIVED some sheets with what was written by some of the ""TWICE"" Crew! 
And where Sana almost cried. 
It's where she read the words "" I will always be by your side"".

Our goals are 1M sales and 50 Million views in the first 24hours! Please Onces, let’s start saving money and collect Hearts in Apps such as Mubeat, StarPlay, IDOLCHAMP, Mwave and Whosfan! 

If you want to make donations to help with the upcoming comeback, it would be really helpful if you could follow the guide I have linked : https://t.co/3PWT39P9dw

@trixcrispin8158,"Ya'll, I really loved this TTT concept... This time, it's not about the looks, the talents, or anything like an Idol usually shows us. This time it's just full about themselves having fun, relaxing, playing games, cooking, working together, eating together, anything a normal person does everyday, they've shown us that side of their lives and that's really something for me. I just want more of these I want to see them like this, yes there are frames that makes you think it's kinda boring but hey if you're really a fan, you'll enjoy watching whatever you're Idol presents you to watch... like what 쯔위 언니 said at the beginning of the first episode, this TTT is SO real and at the end 사나 언니 also said ""this is reality""... Again, I Love It... 
NaJeongMoSaJiMiDaChaeTzu 언니들 화이팅!!!

@minasharonmyoui8867,When Momo read the letters i'm dying of laughing 🤣🤣,17,2020-09-04T10:47:48Z
@duqmsquf,"we saw what girls truly are in this TTT concept of twice. 

Nayeon laughing in almost everything and also the one who keeps the vibe peaceful and happy. 

Jeongyeon, Jihyo and Mina they're still the same in what i saw them in other reality shows. They are like the unnie version of DaChaeTzu for me.

Momo the chef with her secret spices. The who listens or attentive to Tzuyu the most. 

Sana the babiest. We know she's the smily one and mood maker of twice but she's the most sentimental. 

Dahyun..i feel like everyone babies her in Twice than Chaeyu. Though she's also one of the maknae...but we forgot it because of how she takes care the two babies. 

Chaeyoung the most independent one. She can live everywhere i'm sure. She knows everything once she saw it. But she needs Tzuyu to do it. 

Tzuyu alongside with Chaeyoung can't be separated. They're the babies but they're the most independent. Like they can build a tent. They can do everything...",3,2020-09-04T10:46:56Z
