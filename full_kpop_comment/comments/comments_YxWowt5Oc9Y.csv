@dont_trip_over_ma_leg_please,"I love seventeen choreographies but this one I keep coming back to. It is ever so beautiful in the way it some actions or images are intrinsically connected to the lyrics, and the whole emotion conveyed it just spot on. Some of my favourite parts are when a couple members are having a solo or small group moment in the centre and it flows seamlessly from one small group to another, and then comes back to the whole team. I also love the part where it’s a group of them in the middle, and then the rest are in a circle around the outside doing a different choreography, same with the other times they split and different sections all do different moves. I feel a lot of the way they slot together is almost like this ancient puzzle piece type thing where you can shift the pieces around and it still looks just as cool - likely a testament to their skills as dancers, their teamwork and also the meticulousness of the choreographer.

@ドヨン-z1s,"레투럽 내가 좋아하는 권순영 춤추는 부분

0:35 권호시 파트 시작 이미 춤선도 너무 미쳤음
0:45 어깨 탁탁 터는데 강약 조절 미쳤음
0:47 모자 고쳐 쓰고 후렴? 부분 준비 들어가는 부분 너무 멋있음
1:12 여기 내 최애1 부분  뭔가 다리 뻗고 손짓 그리고 뒤 돌면서 가슴 쿵쿵 하는데 ㅈㄹ 멋있음 뭔가 가끔 생각나서 이 파트만 보러 자주 옴
2:08 뒤 돌면서 걸어 나가는 권순영 ㅈㄴ 멋있음 걍 멋짐 
2:21 밍구랑 거의 바깥쪽 끝까지 갔다가 전속력으로 안쪽으로 들어올때 보이는 그 강약조절이 너무 신기함
2:32 자기 파트 할려고 걸어나오는 부분 그냥 압도감 미침
2:36 내 차애 파트,, 이 부분 강약조절은 권순영이 짱인 것 같다,, 진짜 위로 뻗고 밑까지 내려와서 또 빨리 다음 동작하는데 진짜 어떻게 저렇게 빠르게 움직일까,,  뭔가 독기? 라고 해야 되나? 그렇게 다크한 분위기는 아니지만 빡세게 추는게 보여서(항상 빡세게 추는거 알지만) 안무 영상 보는데 뭔가 내가 다 희열을 느낀다,,
2:44 무릎 따악 세우고 고개도 그냥 정면 아니고 살짝 턱 위로 올린 고개라서 그냥 미침,,

그냥 호시 파트 아닌 부분이어도 너무 좋은 부분이 많아서 (제가 보기에) 정리 해서 올림

@SD-gn7xf,"Omg I’ve been trying to zoom out and watch the whole choreo but my eyes just keep going on to Hoshi and mingyu😭 this choreo just suits them so much 🥹 also, I’ve been noticing but it’s just been made more evident ever since I saw the 97 line covering light a flame, that for someone who is so huge and buff, mingyu is SO GOOD at choreos that are suppose to deliver a softer vibe! Like…I would expect someone as big as him to be able to deliver powerpacked choreos and moves but when he performs these dances with a softer vibe, with movements that require grace, he somehow delivers almost effortlessly and he ends up making the choreo seem more…sensual?!? Like idk…I just wanna keep watching him do those kind of movements which require you to bend ur limbs and body line finely and with grace like the hook step (and most of the choreo) of light a flame and ready to love and fall in flower😳😍🤤🤤🤤
EDIT: OMG GUYS at 1:59, the centres, they literally have to lower themselves on ONE LEG🤯 I cannot IMAGINE the leg strength required to execute that and that too so in sync?🤯

EDIT 2: OMG at 2:19 I think, like when the bridge starts and they all fold in behind Seungkwan? ITS SO BEAUTIFUL 😭 the breathlessness of the song is legit delivered through the choreo too!! Bro how are we ever suppose to notice these details in the music show performances?! It’s too much, that’s why SVT dance videos are an absolute MUST!

@applepie980,"I've just realized but ready to love has a lot of running (idk what it's called but they look like running to me) choreo. Some members, they change their places a lot of times in the song. 

Another one i realized, is in the part right before dk and seungkwan's high note, the members are lined up and holding onto each other's hands but when dk moves from the back to front the hands let go one by one until the last pair(?) Only has their fingers touch each other and then they also let go. It's kinda interesting bc the eng translation of the lyrics in that part is 'i don't wanna waste anymore' . Maybe the person 'don't wanna waste anymore' bc it'd too late if they waste more time to tell the other person that they're 'ready to love'. 

And before that part, where the lyrics are 'With each passing day, my emotions keep growing' the members are lining up one by one in pairs while doing some gestures like holding their heads or reaching out i think it conveys the feeling of ""emotions keep growing"" really well.. 

And in the end, after scoups line 'I want to run for you' the instrumental and choreo just pops out with all of the members dancing the same choreo, different in comparison to the first chorus and second chorus just gives me a feeling like it's a burst of emotion at the end..,

@tellme2584,"I'll be honest with u guys. I don't really like this choreography. 
 Its not unique and satisfying, like others choreos they have done before. Ready To Love is a ballad song just like Don't Wanna Cry but you can see the different between these two choreography where DWC looks so catchy, unique, has sign language and we can sense their emotion through any movements in its choreo. But this RTL choreo lacks those things i said. I saw a comment in another video that says Keone madrid made this choreography. That's why i kinda have this ""it isn't really Seventeen vibe"" feeling. I'm not talking about the members anyway (they're amazing dancers and can pull any type of choreography). It's just the choreo. This choreo is pretty powerful but somehow not catchy at all. It doesn't show off their emotion and uniqueness. 
I want Hoshi & performance team and CYJ to create the choreo instead. I hope Hybe doesn't mess with them

I’ve heard about them a bit but really only into kpop for the last year and a half to two years so there’s a lot I still haven’t seen… however I’m kinda speechless after watching this choreography. Like bts is my ultimate but holy shit this choreography… I’m moderately in shock I think bc that was the coolest thing I’ve seen in a long time lol I don’t know what their fans are called… but I’m excited to fall down another rabbit hole and learn about seventeen! That was extremely unique , entertaining, powerful but soft and loved the unique transitions. Anybody have favorites songs or choreo to start with?

@choose2bekindd,"John 6:40 “For my Father’s will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day.””      

ROMANS 10:9-11“If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. As Scripture says, “Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame”    

God wants us to believe in His One and Only Son, Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior, who died for our sins :D When we truly believe in our hearts that Jesus is Son of God who died for our sins on the cross, we are saved from the eternal fire and have eternal life in Christ Jesus!! 💖 May God bless y’all!!",0,2021-06-29T10:38:44Z

The subtleties of the dance, the formations, that beautiful part where they were in 3 groups and walking at different times. This is one of the most intricate detailed choreographies of Seventeen and props to the cover dancer and groups out there for covering this. Simply together, the delicateness and subtleties of the formations make this really pleasing to watch. As expected of a performance team.

And I always hope that they get appreciated more for their skills.,8,2021-06-21T03:35:09Z

-The embrace at the start + some of the members running in a circle whilst the rest stand. 
-That canon part at 0:40 I adore canon parts in choreos. 
-The arm bit at “run away” in the chorus. I just love the way that line is sung too ughhh
-That cool ass pulsating move at 1:50 it mimics the beat super well. Like it looks how the beat sounds to me???  
- the split group walk thing at 2:06
-That hella cool mirror image pair canon part at 2:20 FR THAT IS SO GORGEOUS I AM OBSESSED. 
-The last part just because last chorus’ are always full of energy and just so fun to watch!! 

Last but not least my fave part is...
-the entire choreo. Just all of it.

Also love how the members run at the start of the choreo and also at the end, kinda randomly like there’s no true destination. It comes full circle and echoes the “run away” lyric in the song and running from love. Very much love when the choreo relates to some of the lyrics :))",358,2021-06-21T01:14:00Z

The first few verses only had like 5 people dance at a time which was a bit weird cause seventeen usually has everyone dance at a time or only have brief pauses where some dance and others dont but it could be cause the new direction they have with hybe, like new choreographers and producers working with hoshi and woozi. the ""you give me purpose"" chorus is more reminiscent of bts and txt style of adding adlibs for the rappers as well, but that might be cause hitman bang worked with woozi on this song. at the end when Seungkwan sings his last part tho (and then on)seventeen pick up their fast pace dance style, they're known for. so all and all pretty good song. the song is really good but i can see the change in thier choreo but i have a feeling it might be because of this specific song.",1,2021-06-20T23:45:04Z

@am_rima,"You all know what super impressive from SEVENTEEN though, is the fact that this choreography in general has a lot of running, changing formation, and like control movements where they appear all smooth, strong/powerful/ and very detailed, like you can literally see each and every part of their body moving and dancing to the music BUT!! still MANAGE to sing and rap with such stability.... like that's full on professionalism. When their part comes up in like the live performances, they appear like they were not just doing a bunch of running or dancing, it's as if they have been waiting for their part for long that that ONE quick moment of their line is very memorable.

I can easily see and have a good moment for each member's parts on this song and I'm honestly impressed even after what? 7 years since pre-debut era in 2013 hahah 👏🏻💞✨",0,2021-06-20T19:24:00Z

I was planning to learn the dance...But it's been hours since the time I started to wonder ""why did I even think I can learn the dance?"" As a dancer, I can really say dancing this alone won't really give justice, cuz all their choreographies have a story and meaning that if one member or one person dancing is not present, it kind of loses its expression completely.

First thing... When it was S-coups line "" Cause you are my escape "" and the way they pop their shoulders and are in sync is so fascinating

Second thing... Giving the youngest aka Dino his center performance is just so cute.

Third thing... The performance and energy they give are so empowering and powerful. It makes the song have a lot of meaning to it

Fourth thing... The concept and the outfits for this song is just so fitting and I love how true they are when they're performing

The 5th and final thing... They are such perfectionists and they make their dance look so easy but it's not.

Like you can actually SEE it. If a member is standing, the other members go in a low angle, or vice versa! While the rest are standing, a member is down.

@amirakartika4489,just noticed that Minghao didn't join the last chorus which is the hardest part of the choreography and I couldn't feel more relieved because of that🥺 Minghao really is a hard worker and the real professional idol cause even when he got injured he's still manage himself to be able to show us his best and dance professionally like he's in a good condition. this makes me feel proud and love him even more but still can't resist myself from worrying his condition too T______T truly hope that the 10 days of self-quarantine would helps him to get well real soon,5066,2021-06-20T06:27:41Z

You can see the music flows thru their fingers. And the sound of their footsteps and shoes hitting the floor is giving me goosebumps bcs they are so in sync! Vernon's moves are smooooth like liquid. Hoshi's are sharp but glides like water. There's really no bad dancer in Seventeen! Everyone executed their part perfectly making the whole choreo beautiful 💖 you must have worked really hard on this! Thank you Seventeen!,13,2021-06-20T06:23:00Z
