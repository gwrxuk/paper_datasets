@ももも-u9b,"내 숨이 있는 곳 (있는 곳)
네 향기로 난 숨을 쉰다
모질게 짙은 넌
내 가슴 깊이 파고 든다
세상에 가득 찬 거칠은 거짓은
오히려 나를 용감하게 만드는 걸
너라서 아무렇지 않아
그래서 아무렇지 않아
온통 주윈 너란 생각 uh uh
내 머릿속에 깊이 뿌리 내려 uh uh
아무리 줄기를 꺾는대도
비바람 불어서 흔들어대도
넌 이미 활짝 펴버린 내 flower uh uh
Yeh 어둠에 숨은 꽃
Yeh 가시가 피어서
Yeh 날 찌른대도
Yeh
나를 알려준 나를 보여준
너는 나만의 꽃이니까
영원히 네가 내 맘에 핀다면 난
다쳐도 돼 다쳐도 돼
날 타고 흐르는 상처 자국은
너를 위해 있을 뿐이야
날카로운 너의 가시 나에게 줘
Cause you're my flower
Give me that
괜찮냐고 물어보지 마
너를 향한 맘이니까
내리는 비를 가려주려
내 등은 하늘을 향해
늘 꽃은 피고 지는 법 어째서
내게 넌 깊숙히 피고 있어 always
너에게 다가가면 상처 나겠지만
그래도 두 팔은 널 감싸 줄거야
Yeh 어둠에 숨은 너
Yeh 가시가 피어서
Yeh 날 찌른대도
Yeh
나를 알려준 나를 보여준
너는 나만의 꽃이니까
영원히 네가 내 맘에 핀다면 난
다쳐도 돼 다쳐도 돼
날 타고 흐르는 상처 자국은
너를 위해 있을 뿐이야
날카로운 너의 가시 나에게 줘
Cause you're my flower
내 모든 상처의 흉터는 너라서 괜찮아
줄기로 몸을 타고 만개하라 (더더)
아름다움을 넌 만끽하다 (더더)
날카롭게 변해가며 가시돋아
찔러가도 너라면 나는 좋아
나를 알려준 나를 보여준
너는 나의 유일한 이유
영원히 네가 날 기억한다면 난
다쳐도 돼 다쳐도 돼
너의 빛으로 새긴 마음은
나를 강하게 만드니까
날카로운 너의 가시 나에게 줘

내 숨이 있는 곳 (있는 곳)
네 향기로 난 숨을 쉰다
모질게 짙은 넌
내 가슴 깊이 파고 든다
세상에 가득 찬 거칠은 거짓은
오히려 나를 용감하게 만드는 걸 yeah
너라서 아무렇지 않아 (않아)
그래서 아무렇지 않아 (않아)
온통 주윈 너란 생각 uh uh
내 머릿속에 깊이 뿌리 내려 uh uh
아무리 줄기를 꺾는대도 비바람 불어서 흔들어대도
넌 이미 활짝 펴버린 내 flower uh uh
Yeah yeah 어둠에 숨은 꽃
Yeah yeah 가시가 피어서
Yeah yeah 날 찌른대도
Yeah yeah
나를 알려준 나를 보여준
너는 나만의 꽃이니까
영원히 네가 내 맘에 핀다면 난
다쳐도 돼 다쳐도 돼
날 타고 흐르는 상처 자국은
너를 위해 있을 뿐이야
날카로운 너의 가시 나에게 줘
'Cause you're my flower
Give me that
괜찮냐고 물어보지 마
너를 향한 맘이니까
내리는 비를 가려주려
내 등은 하늘을 향해
늘 꽃은 피고 지는 법 (지는 법) 어째서
내게 넌 깊숙히 피고 있어 always
너에게 다가가면 상처 나겠지만
그래도 두 팔은 널 감싸 줄거야
Yeah yeah 어둠에 숨은 꽃
Yeah yeah 가시가 피어서
Yeah yeah 날 찌른대도
Yeah yeah
나를 알려준 나를 보여준
너는 나만의 꽃이니까
영원히 네가 내 맘에 핀다면 난
다쳐도 돼 다쳐도 돼
날 타고 흐르는 상처 자국은
너를 위해 있을 뿐이야
날카로운 너의 가시 나에게 줘
'Cause you're my flower
내 모든 상처의 흉터는 너라서 괜찮아
줄기로 몸을 타고 만개하라 (더더)
아름다움을 넌 만끽하다 (더더)
날카롭게 변해가며 가시돋아 (더)
찔러가도 너라면 나는 좋아
나를 알려준 나를 보여준
너는 나의 유일한 이유
영원히 네가 날 기억한다면 난
다쳐도 돼 다쳐도 돼
너의 빛으로 새긴 마음은
나를 강하게 만드니까
날카로운 너의 가시 나에게 줘

너라서 아무렇지 않아
그래서 아무렇지 않아
온통 주윈 너란 생각 uh uh

아무리 줄기를 꺾는대도
비바람 불어서 흔들어대도
넌 이미 활짝 펴버린 내 Flower uh uh

Give me that
괜찮냐고 물어보지 마
너를 향한 맘이니까
내리는 비를 가려주려
내 등은 하늘을 향해
늘 꽃은 피고 지는 법 어째서 
내게 넌 깊숙히 피고 있어 Always
너에게 다가가면 상처 나겠지만
그래도 두 팔은 널 감싸 줄거야

나를 알려준 나를 보여준
너는 나의 유일한 이유
영원히 네가 날 기억한다면 난

Its a fictional disease in which the victim coughs up flower petals when they suffer from one sided love. It ends when the beloved returns their feelings (romantic love only; strong friendship is not enough), or when the victim dies. It can be cured through surgical removal, but when the infection is removed, the victim's romantic feelings for their love also disappear.",4,2020-09-14T16:59:19Z

@breadstickcrumb,"Sometimes people talk about how this choreo isn’t as in sync as svt’s other dances, but I think as a dancer and choreographer, each person will differ in what they focus on. Dino, while also focusing on the base choreography, tends to put more energy and focus towards emotions and passions of each dancer and the overall feeling (big picture) rather than the synchronization of each dancer themselves. But that’s just my take I guess. Just because a dance isn’t as in sync in terms of having the exact same path they take and the same degree that their hand is extended in, doesn’t mean it’s bad and not in sync. The important parts that Dino wants to highlight are still emphasized in the choreography. I think it’s quite refreshing to see everyone dancing more distinctly in their own style. They all really shine c:",3605,2020-08-16T16:24:29Z

@nekograce7914,What’s amazing about SVT’s choreo is they utilize contemporary/modern dance style and hip hop so fluidly. It’s why in my opinion they are the best when it comes to dance. There are other groups I love and are super talented dancers like GOT7 and Stray Kids but SVT still rules the metaphorical school yard.,700,2019-05-04T05:32:47Z

너무 신선하고 독특해서 오잉?하면서 봤는데 거의 홀린듯 넋놓고 봤던 기억이남~
근데 막둥이 디노가 만든춤이란걸 알고 진심놀랬음..
늦었지만 꼭 이 영상에 댓글을 달고싶었네요..
지금은 세븐틴에 완벽하게 입덕해서 응원하는중이예요ㅎㅎ

@svtluv4419,"*For the carats who doesnt know what exactly is happening:*
let me tell you the recent news what pledis announced that they might do..
they said that they were going make all the artists channel from pledis into *1 channel* “pledis”. This means all our hard work like the views,likes and more such as “dont wanna cry” (1 million views!!) and memories (like videos from before debut)will be gone.. CARATS YOU WOULD NOW KNOW HOW PLEDIS IS BEING SELFISH -just because they have much less followers than seventeen- 
_remember is not just us its the whole artists and their fans getting affected by this_

@나방-g9c,"내 숨이 있는 곳 (있는 곳)
네 향기로 난 숨을 쉰다
모질게 짙은 넌
내 가슴 깊이 파고 든다

세상에 가득 찬 거칠은 거짓은
오히려 나를 용감하게 만드는 걸
너라서 아무렇지 않아
그래서 아무렇지 않아

온통 주윈 너란 생각 uh uh
내 머릿속에 깊이 뿌리 내려 uh uh 
아무리 줄기를 꺾는대도
비바람 불어서 흔들어대도
넌 이미 활짝 펴버린 내 
Flower uh uh

Yeh 어둠에 숨은 꽃
Yeh 가시가 피어서
Yeh 날 찌른대도
Yeh

나를 알려준 나를 보여준
너는 나만의 꽃이니까
영원히 네가 내 맘에 핀다면 난
다쳐도 돼 다쳐도 돼

날 타고 흐르는 상처 자국은
너를 위해 있을 뿐이야
날카로운 너의 가시 나에게 줘

Cause you’re my Flower

Give me that
괜찮냐고 물어보지 마
너를 향한 맘이니까
내리는 비를 가려주려
내 등은 하늘을 향해

늘 꽃은 피고 지는 법 어째서 
내게 넌 깊숙히 피고 있어 Always 
너에게 다가가면 상처 나겠지만
그래도 두 팔은 널 감싸 줄거야

Yeh 어둠에 숨은 너
Yeh 가시가 피어서
Yeh 날 찌른대도
Yeh

나를 알려준 나를 보여준
너는 나만의 꽃이니까
영원히 네가 내 맘에 핀다면 난
다쳐도 돼 다쳐도 돼

날 타고 흐르는 상처 자국은
너를 위해 있을 뿐이야
날카로운 너의 가시 나에게 줘

Cause you’re my Flower

내 모든 상처의 흉터는 너라서 괜찮아

줄기로 몸을 타고 만개하라 (더더)
아름다움을 넌 만끽하다 (더더)
날카롭게 변해가며 가시돋아
찔러가도 너라면 나는 좋아

나를 알려준 나를 보여준
너는 나의 유일한 이유
영원히 네가 날 기억한다면 난
다쳐도 돼 다쳐도 돼

너의 빛으로 새긴 마음은
나를 강하게 만드니까
날카로운 너의 가시 나에게 줘

@moon-wy9st,"To Carats who aren’t aware yet:
Pledis may begin posting videos of ALL their artists on the Pledis Entertainment channel, including their MVs. Unsubscribing to that channel (if you were in the first place) or trending on Twitter that you don’t agree with the decision probably won’t do anything. Getting Pledis to start posting on the individual artists’ channels again is not worth potentially sabotaging the groups’ success by refusing to stream or share on other platforms. MV views make up a sizeable percentage of the criteria to win on a lot of music shows, as most of us are aware, and it’s one of the most direct ways for us to support them. We can’t really do anything as fans; we hold little to no authority over this matter.

The teaser for the Getting Closer MV has already been posted there.",0,2018-12-15T15:39:11Z

@cherryvt4815,"This is what I like about seventeen. They can group themselves as many as they can but still represent it as ""one"" what I mean even they group into 2 members, 3, 6 or 8 in a group they are still seventeen that we know. 
They are unique and very versatile young men. Everyone contributes great ideas, music and awesome choreographys. And I think no one is left behind because everyone shines and bloom just as their season to get famous. :)

One more thing...? They love each other and they don't see it as a competition. They work as a team and keep encouraging one another to get better and better performer. 

Job well done Pledis. 
Please take care and handle them well. Go SVT! #carats #shiningdiamond #dec2018",974,2018-12-12T19:55:54Z

I meant that I fell in love with you more.  You never failed melting my heart every time you sing. I think I just fall in love to an idol. But i just thought, you will never know i exist. My heart is breaking but at the same time melting. It is because of you. Knowing that i love you as a man, but you just love me as a fan. Oh well, a fan can dream.

But at the same time, I'm proud that I am a fan of you. A carat. I'm proud to be a carat.

@sissymayemaye,"To Pledis Entertainment:
For those of us who are relatively new Carats, THANK YOU!!!!! 
I only became a fan last year (I mistakenly thought the boys were under SM who I was personally protesting the treatment of their artists at the time), and therefore had to take a SEVENTEEN crash course to catch up with all the other Carats and make up for lost time, lol ! As I got to know SEVENTEEN, there were two songs that stood out and completely defined them to me. The first was Smile Flowers, which moved me SO much, it inspired me to write my first chapter fanfic (Soonhoon/HoWoo centric--I'll put the link below in case you care to inspect, lol), and THIS song, Flower. This song inspired me to pull out my old chain belts and ankle bells and start bellydancing again. So naturally, when I saw this notification, I immediately clicked, and I was NOT disappointed!! I LOVE IT!! My heart will always belong to Hoshi, but Dino got to shine in this one, and I'm sure his big brother was in the wings cheering for him along with everyone else ( or should I say his twin. As much as the two of them protest, they DO look alike. When they have similar hair color, I've gotten them confused several times, lol)!!
Anyway, thanks again, Pledis for giving us such wonderful talented boys and for taking good care of their health and for letting them do awesome side projects such as these that showcase their talent! Kamsahamnida!!

To whoever decided Jeonghan would be a part of Flower— I love you and I hope you're doing well and have a bright future ahead of you. HE FUCKING NAILED THIS SONG AND IT SUITS HIM SO MUCH. 

It's just my opinion and I'm not bashing them or anything but I've noticed Seventeen aren't as synchronized as they used to be. Synchronization is one of their trademarks, and I wish they won't lose it in the future.",1,2018-12-12T09:41:28Z

내 숨이 있는 곳 (있는 곳)
네 향기로 난 숨을 쉰다
모질게 짙은 넌
내 가슴 깊이 파고 든다

세상에 가득 찬 거칠은 거짓은
오히려 나를 용감하게 만드는 걸
너라서 아무렇지 않아
그래서 아무렇지 않아

온통 주윈 너란 생각 uh uh
내 머릿속에 깊이 뿌리 내려 uh uh 
아무리 줄기를 꺾는대도
비바람 불어서 흔들어대도
넌 이미 활짝 펴버린 내 
Flower uh uh

Yeh 어둠에 숨은 꽃
Yeh 가시가 피어서
Yeh 날 찌른대도
Yeh

나를 알려준 나를 보여준
너는 나만의 꽃이니까
영원히 네가 내 맘에 핀다면 난
다쳐도 돼 다쳐도 돼

날 타고 흐르는 상처 자국은
너를 위해 있을 뿐이야
날카로운 너의 가시 나에게 줘

Cause you’re my Flower

Give me that
괜찮냐고 물어보지 마
너를 향한 맘이니까
내리는 비를 가려주려
내 등은 하늘을 향해

늘 꽃은 피고 지는 법 어째서 
내게 넌 깊숙히 피고 있어 Always 
너에게 다가가면 상처 나겠지만
그래도 두 팔은 널 감싸 줄거야

Yeh 어둠에 숨은 너
Yeh 가시가 피어서
Yeh 날 찌른대도
Yeh

나를 알려준 나를 보여준
너는 나만의 꽃이니까
영원히 네가 내 맘에 핀다면 난
다쳐도 돼 다쳐도 돼

날 타고 흐르는 상처 자국은
너를 위해 있을 뿐이야
날카로운 너의 가시 나에게 줘

Cause you’re my Flower

내 모든 상처의 흉터는 너라서 괜찮아

줄기로 몸을 타고 만개하라 (더더)
아름다움을 넌 만끽하다 (더더)
날카롭게 변해가며 가시돋아
찔러가도 너라면 나는 좋아

나를 알려준 나를 보여준
너는 나의 유일한 이유
영원히 네가 날 기억한다면 난
다쳐도 돼 다쳐도 돼

너의 빛으로 새긴 마음은
나를 강하게 만드니까
날카로운 너의 가시 나에게 줘
