@SleepIntoTheDiamondLife,"watching this for the second time, I really think in this episode the smart ones were definitely dino, seungkwan, the8 and vernon. the others definitely did well. but these 4 played are not just smart, but intelligent too. dino made a deal with ww and casually made a team with 3 other members and kept eliminating ww from everyone's list without even making it suspicious. and later just in the 2nd round he reveals about the deal too but still no one found any suspicious names from his convo. seungkwan and hao literally made the accurate guess even though there were 11 other members left. they collected information from wherever they could, played nicely without causing much ruckus. sadly, instead they got suspected for being mafia but even kwannie got eliminated because clearly he was a threat to ww. and vernon also knew who other mafias were but he kept acting aloof even when he shared info or had fingers pointed at him. he made it more suspicious that it was him and then DK confirmed it, so he only acted after that the way the suspicion would be more on him but not others. damn, these four are really underrated but it had to be said.

1. one person (for now) knows the murderer, hasn’t told anyone
2. one person, the policeman is pretending to know who who it is
3. The murderer will probably kill person 2
4. The fake, also the policeman has revealed to the doctor that he lied
5. The doctor will save the policeman ?
Basically the policeman could sacrifice himself so that the one who actually knows the murderer will survive and reveal the murderer but then also be saved by the doctor.
6. The policeman knows one of the mafia",0,2023-11-07T19:16:42Z

DK NOT TRUSTING MINGYU LMAO WJSJJWJE RIP BESTIE HE SAID

edit again cause I can’t keep it’s this is so confusing and frustrating: IF MINGYU DK SCOUPS AND SEUNGKWAN KNEW IT WAS DINO THEN WHY DIDNT THEY TELL SOMETHING—ANYTHING. THEY COULDVE GET RID OF HIM FROM THE START (aka 2nd round but still) GOSH I HATE IT HERE SKSKKSJSKDJ


probably last edit: Wonwoo’s mind 🤯 he was the perfect mafia, for those acting skills and is super smart I AM SPEECHLESS BOY DID I UNDERESTIMATE YOU? Maybe I did.

ok istg ultimate edit for myself: SCOUPS WHO HASNT REALIZED WONWOO WAS THE MAFIA IM DYING EVERYONE UNDERSTOOD THE SECOND HE SAID THANK YOU TO DINO BUT SEUNGCHEOL WAS FLYING IN HIS OWN MIND I CANT W HIM how could’ve I even been suspecious of his 2 brain cells in the first place lmao",0,2023-05-31T15:25:56Z

@eggiesepisodes,the way vernon is lying through his teeth,0,2023-05-30T18:56:55Z
@sonalisamal2009,"I knew Wonwoo is smart, and I knew he was a mafia the moment Jeonghan was eliminated first. He's really calculative, calm, observant and smart which ensured his win. He really impresses me along with Jeonghan, but the difference between them is their personality in these games. Jeonghan is extremely smart, but he's also likely to get suspected first because of all his usual antics, so there is always a chance that he could get eliminated first. And this on the other hand, I believe is an advantage for The8, Wonwoo who are like the quiet members and nobody even doubts them for a bit. They don't garner any attention and play it to their strengths, which is why I feel they would make amazing mafias. Jeonghan however plans everything right from the go, so even when he's not actively present in the game, he still wins somehow because of the way he orchestrates everything. I wonder if he'd still be in the game, would he be able to guess Wonwoo? I could guess Vernon was a mafia too because of the way he was acting in the previous episode (he was very evasive), but I couldn't guess Dino at all. And, I could guess Wonwoo only because Jeonghan was eliminated first and then the order in which everyone else was getting eliminated, it clearly seemed like someone who is sort of observant and calculative. It screamed Wonwoo to me ❤😂

I also want to mention how DK has amazing intuition about things, and how Seungkwan always recalls every information he has gathered and paints a clearer picture of things and gets the correct answers most of the time, but gets eliminated before he can reveal anything (He got all correct answers here about the murderer). Also, not to forget Jun and The8 who are very observant and smart. They are not very active overtly but they always get closer to answers.",31,2023-05-30T16:25:52Z

@meyyy8331,"Dino did good honestly. the murderer has no chance bec its only a matter of deduction and there are 13 tries per round. He was able to gain trust at the beginning by getting an X and sharing it honestly. By the 2nd round he was last to go so he can’t really cause confusion by giving incorrect guesses. And that is where wonwoo shines, just aggressively removing all suspicions around 👏👏👏 and ofc vernon for jumping at the chance to cause confusion 😂😂",2,2023-04-18T05:11:42Z

The 8's (Minghao) expressions killed me this entire episode haha when his face turned red in the interrogation area <3. i thought Scoups would be something and suspected him the entire game if the word sus ever becomes human it would be Scoups. Finally dr Mingyu he was really good and i swear he’s a baby in a giant form adorable TT <3. Also poor DK (literally). Jun barely had any screen time but he was just as adorable <3.  Woozi also barely had any screen time but he was hilarious in defending himself haha. Poor Joshua no one avenged his death haha. i have never seen Jeonghan die this fast in a game poor guy did not get a chance haha.

the first and probably last time i will ever get SOMETHING in don't lie right 😭 with almost no logical reasoning, i somehow guessed since the start that dino was the mafia and the murderer. 

vernon leaned over to dino at 10:15 after hoshi started suspecting myungho (probably to tell him he would go mess with him and attempt to make the members suspect him of being his partner) - pulling a hoshi from don't lie 1, i guess 😂 

even after dino confirmed that he was the mafia, but not the murderer, i still knew it in my bones + he was probably thinking that if he outs himself, they'll try to look for the ""actual murderer"" and not bother to kill or check him.",1,2023-03-30T17:09:18Z

@Knightwsl,Don’t Lie: Clue 1 & 2 are truly my favorite Don’t Lie episodes EVER. Probably because Clue has always been my favorite board game since I was a child.

PLUS, HE KEEPS ON GIVING SOME SIGNS THAT HE IS A MAFIA/MURDERER, IDK IF Y'ALL NOTICE THAT) and Wonwoo was sus, but, Wonwoo is good at misleading. He's really smart. I believed him for a sec but when he told Cheol and the others that the mafia or the murderer might be Woozi, I was like, ""wait a damn minute, I'm missing something,"" THEN I FIGURED OUT THAT ""MAYBE"" WONWOO WAS REALLY A MAFIA AND HE'S JUST MISLEADING THE OTHERS (PLUS, I REMEMBERED HE ASKED IN THE 1ST INTEROGATION WHO GOT THE HIGHEST POINT FROM THE PREVIOUS DON'T LIE AND MINUTES LATER, JEONGHAN WAS OUT.) THAT'S WHEN I KNEW THAT WONWOO WAS A MAFIA. HE'S SO FREAKING SMART. IN ADDITION, WONWOO HAS THIS FACIAL EXPRESSION THAT HE EXUDES WHENEVER THE MEMBERS ARE TALKING ABOUT THE MAFIAS.

@danitx_,"I absolutely loved this episode. Watching it again, you can see Vernon slightly poking Dino at 10:10, right after Scoups decided to throw The 8 under the bus with Hoshi. Then he got closer to Dino and decided to sit near The8 - and he definitely protected the mafia since he was already exposed. So clever Vernon! ❤ I also believe that he didn’t wanted to help Seungkwan and Joshua on the first episode because he was a mafia. He could easily be exposed if he got involved by sharing information.

I kind of understand now why Dino said that mafia was deciding by himself at 18:43… At 14:01 he kind of promised to Seungkwan that he wouldn’t kill him… and he died on that round 😂 - and Seungkwan at 31:23 even says to Jeonghan and Joshua that he’s upset cause they killed him hahaha. On that note, I have a feeling that Hoshi realized or listened something cause he was acting weird looking at Dino after the end of the round (18:28) hahah poor thing. And connecting everything, I think that’s why they pretended to choose Hoshi to die at the final round at 28:13. He got quiet once he found out - and DK would have more points for being the police anyway.

I also loved how Jun and The8 were sharing info in the background at 15:04 and now they are leading the competition ❤!",1,2023-03-30T01:39:20Z

@beevlee,"[spoilers, obviously] 

the first and probably last time i will ever get SOMETHING in don't lie right 😭 with almost no logical reasoning, i somehow guessed since the start that dino was the mafia and the murderer. 

vernon leaned over to dino at 10:15 after hoshi started suspecting myungho (probably to tell him he would go mess with him and attempt to make the members suspect him of being his partner) - pulling a hoshi from don't lie 1, i guess 😂 

even after dino confirmed that he was the mafia, but not the murderer, i still knew it in my bones because he was probably thinking that if he outs himself, they'll try to look for the ""actual murderer"" and not bother to kill or check him. 

i had the feeling that wonwoo was the mafia since clue #1, even though he was being active by helping the others and giving (mostly) correct information - i confirmed my suspicions in that interaction at 21:40, just by the look on wonwoo's face when dino decided to approach his group and tell them he was ""covering for the mafias"". wonwoo had the good guy vibes, but i could just just TELL.

i know this is all pretty obvious now, but me and my singular brain cell have never correctly guessed anything like this ahead of time before - as gose editors would say, ""pure luck, zero intuition, but still congratulating herself that she did well"" 😭💀",2,2023-03-29T23:00:30Z

@dotdotdot...176,"[Spoilers] Ah I kind of feel bad for DK, he did a great job as policeman (his first time with a role in GoSe Don't Lie), he identified a mafia right way and he survived almost to the end, but he doesn't get a share of the money/points. Also his acting was great throughout this episode, when he first yelled ""O!"", I genuinely couldn't tell if he was lying or not. Then at the end it turned out to be a triple-bluff because he did actually find the correct suspect, scene and weapon. His acting has really improved. But Wonwoo also did a great job as mafia, he made smart decisions when killing off people such as taking out Jeonghan first because he had most points and is often a major player when it comes to mind games. He also acted very well and even thugh they all suspected him in the first round, he managed to completely avoid suspicion after that round. He has always been a good actor, especially with his facial expressions and body language, but he did a great job here. I didn't suspect him at all, and I feel like most people couldn't tell if he was acting or just being himself, because he was so natural with it. Our SVT twins had big roles in this episode!",3,2023-03-29T20:27:29Z

And It just wasn't his luck to win this time. 

He suspected Wonwoo was a murderer at the beginning of the episode (even though it was true he was a mafia) but he ignored his intuition and didn't check him, he checked on vernon (and yes, mafia), he guessed Dino as a mafia murderer and was right (mafia murderer).

@user-dp5yc9xb3k,"14:22부터 찬이랑 승관이 관계성 너무 신기하고 재밌음... 

디노가 살인 마피아인 거 아는데도 협박이나 딜 안 거는 것도 신기함 보통 세븐틴 내에서 범인 알면 ‘너 정체 비밀로 할 테니 상금 나누자’는 말이 오가는데...!!.. 

더 신기한 거 또 있음 
승관이는 시민이라 그럴 이유가 없는데 살인마피아 디노한테 내가 너 정체 알고 있단 티 내면서 계속 자기 잡으라 하고, ‘너 얘기를 유일하게 들어줄 사람이 누군데’ 라면서 대화 시도 하는 것도 너무너무 신기함... 
ㄹㅇ 쇼윈도 혐관이라는 말이 딱임... 

디노도 승관이 안 죽이겠다고 했는데 다른 마피아 원우가 독단적으로 승관이 죽이려 하니까(27:43) 다급하게 형.. 형..!... 하면서 최대한 막으려고 함.. (안 막아졌지만) 

결국 승관이 죽고 (18:41) 마피아한테 한 마디 하겠다며 혼자 결정 안 했으면 좋겠다고 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 자기가 승관이 안 죽였단 뜻 내포해서 승관이한테 말 하는 것 같아.... 

글고 디노 - 원우도 흥미로움... 
저번 영상 1라운드에서 디노가 심문 첫 번째였는데 원우 먼저 확인한 다음 멤버들한테 원우형은 아니라고 말해서 원우 의심 못 하게 한 것도.. 

21:45에서 마피아랑 거래를 했다~ 라는 말 하면서 자기가 희생하고(죽으면 디노는 점수 못 받음) 원우 지켜줌... 원우 표정을 봐요 
원우 퍼스널컬러가 디노인 이유를 납득함

– *consistent.* he doesn't act differently just because he's got a role. he's still that same quiet nerd on the side quietly observing like he always does, which is advantageous now that he's a mafia

– *competitively strategic.* he immediately thought of eliminating jeonghan, the one with the highest point in the scoreboard

– *overarching antagonist.* he thinks by himself and totally disregards the real murderer because he too can kill on his own lol

– *embodies a real mafia.* he understands ambition (hoshi's desire to win), but not distrust and disloyalty (dk suspecting mingyu) but this is just my pov lol",1238,2023-03-29T14:53:55Z

First things first, I have suspected Vernon in the beginning, in the scene where he was told to go to interrogation room and The8 keeps on telling him to bring someone. He was somewhat confused or maybe he didn't heard that they need to bring someone with them. 

Next, I take a closer look on each location and noticed an image of candlestick in the meeting room (its blurred so I have assume its candlestick haha). Also, I don't see any mentioned tools in other areas, so I have concluded that its 'meeting room' and as what Scoups found out.

Never did I imagine its Wonwoo, the last standing mafia. He was never my candidate (my guess: Dino (for awkwardly playing piano haha), Vernon, and Scoups (I thought he was acting as civilian, luring his co-mafias haha). He played it well! huhu

@lora9088,I was so convinced that Woozi or Jun were the other mafia members and was completely flabbergasted when it revealed that it was actually Wonwoo. they checked him so many times at the beginning of the game and it was always wrong but I failed to realize that they were either wrong about the location or the tool used and not the person. very well played,5,2023-03-29T14:17:45Z

- DK’s trust issue is 📈 & apparently slowly lost his innocence thanks to Don’t Lie

@beiii.,"watching the others dont lie ive always thought wonwoo as the mafia would be perfect and I WAS RIGHT he´s so smart and calculating, i didnt even thought of him being a mafia member. Killing Jeonghan was really smart knowing that he had the highest score and normally he´s very good at the mafia game so it could be a problem. Woonwoo took the lead out of the mafia members and i think he did reeeeeally good. never disappointed by this guy intelligence.
