Oh I'm not alone
Everyday I open my eyes
And I always find something new
I meet myself in the mirror
And blossom a new me

Just paint the time (just paint it)
Nothing's set in stone (Yeh yeh)
Nothing's too fast or too slow
Our life is Lalalalalala

Row your dreams beyond the parallel lines
Times of happiness fill the pockets of our hearts
No need to rush, you're doing fine
Just stay as you are
My journey starts with me

Over the sun My my my my my way
Step by step get closer closer
This is the place I've dreamed of
Keep hold of our hearts
And come to me Oh oh

@akutenshi2909,"Wow, the choreography was very beautiful.
It didn’t only a dance it was very expressive... sorry for my bad English...

I mean. It could be only a dance and that’s all, but the choreography show: the ship, the campfire, the sea, the travel...
Idk if you’re understanding my point ^^”, sorry again 

Well, the choreography was beautiful, expressive and very elaborate. Thanks for all ❤️",9,2020-07-06T12:08:29Z

@kimmingyu8491,"*ATTENTION CARATs!!!*

*LEFT & RIGHT MASS V0TING AND STR17MING PROJECT.*

We need to mass str17m and vote. We need to hit 45M in order to give our SEVENTEEN more wins. We are called CARATs for a reason, we make our SEVENTEEN shine.

●v0te for Seventeen on idolchamp.
*-Please use multiple devices if you have, we are losing currently.*

●please mass str17m we need to hit 45M today.
*-Use multiple accounts to str17m, I also heard it's better to use YouTube premium while you str17m. When you comment/interact with the video censor words like ""str17m"" ""str17ming"" ""vie₩s"" ""vie₩"" ""v0te"" ""v0tes"" ""v0ting"" do not use em0jis, do not use links and do not use hashtags. Make sure you're logged in onto your account. Search for ""left & right"" on Youtube and then watch the video without pausing, rewinding or fast forwarding. Also, make sure to watch it on normal speed and 480p-720p quality. Make sure the volume is 50+.Do not use the replay button. Make sure your watch and search history is not on pause also do not clear your watch and search history. Do not watch the music video continuously, YouTube might consider you as a bot if you watch the mv continuously with the same account so take breaks for 10 minutes and in between those 10 minutes watch other videos on YouTube. Come back yo str17ming after 10 minutes.*

Please spread this on your social media accounts, make more CARATs join this mass v0ting and str17ming project.

Reminder-there are ""baby carats"" who ask how to vote, they're NOT CARATs. They're people from our competitor's fandom, they're trying to learn our strategy of v0ting. So please do NOT engage with them and only focus on SEVENTEEN. 

*We worked hard now we need to work harder for our SEVENTEEN.*

If you have more questions regarding str17ming and voting then feel free to comment down below or you can dm me on Twitter or instagram. I'll try my best to help my fellow CARATs out.

3:13 vernon puts his arm around him


ALL/GENERAL (mainly my fav choreo parts)
this isn't a specific thing but throughout this they all lipsync to parts that aren't their own and i just think that's really cute cos they're all just vibing to their own song
0:55 you may have noticed by me putting it as part of literally all of their commentaries but i adore this part of the choreo
1:10 &  2:08 cos the chicken move makes me super happy
1:33 the way they're so synchronised in getting to the floor is suuuuper satisfying
1:52 ABSOLUTELY STUNNING, MY FAVOURITE PART OF THE WHOLE CHOREO, THE WAY THEY MADE THE WATER IS SO SATISFYING AND THEN BOOSEOKSOL SMILING TOGETHER HAS MY HEART, IF UR GONNA WATCH ANY PART AGAIN PLS WATCH THIS 
2:33 THIS PART WHERE THEYRE ROUND A CAMPFIRE IS SO CUTE AND BEAUTIFULLY DONE AND JUST *sobs in the corner from how adorable*


throughout this whole choreo they just look super happy and like theyre having fun which makes ME super happy (and hopefully you too) so yeh, this is one of my fav choreos just simply for how they made full scenarios out of just their bodies :0000


and now i have watched this vid on repeat for about an hour and a half so im gonna stop here. hope this helped someone!!!
there will defos be ones ive missed so feel free to comment them under this to point them out!",561,2020-07-05T01:21:53Z

tbh i love them so much because of this little things, they really are a true artist, they even tell something through their choreo and it's damn creative and amazing
and tbh fallin flower's choreo is just an art that were inspired by flower and damn how could you make a choreo with so much meaning in it? 
anyways i just find it mind blowing, and i'm sorry if i can't say my words effectively

@vwonwoozi,"Seventeen are the only group whose choreography/ performance videos I could watch on repeat. 
It’s just so nice to watch, like no matter the concept because they’re all amazing dancers and can express it all very well in their own style, yet being cohesive with the whole group.
ALSO the synergy and synchronicity between them all is just on another level and they never slack off even if they’re not at the front and on top of all that you can just tell how much they enjoy performing and having fun with each other!

Anyway svt keep doing as you are, you’re all doing great and have come so far already. Carats will always support you 💛

@hotaru2020,"Even without the award, we know that the best dance performance group title was made for them. Every group deserve it but every fandom can agree that Seventeen is the most deserving. Before most idols started partaking in the composition of their songs, Seventeen already does it --- not to impress but because they needed to. And people can't deny, they dance with all their heart on every performance and sing with their soul. They pour their emotions and experiences on the lyrics they write and Woozi and Bumzu and some of the members do their best to give justice to their well-thought words. Hoshi do not simply creates their choreographies, he thoughtfully *innovates* and make sure that the message their songs are trying to show are delivered through their dance moves. Every group is great but no one makes me prouder and happier than these 13 men.
