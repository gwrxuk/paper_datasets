@shadiyap3112,"So here's the thing, our 8th BTS anniversary goal is to make ""NO MORE DREAM"" hit 1B. I know it sounds difficult but we have to do it. BTS always thought that their debut was not a bop and didn't wanted to look back at it. If we armys, hit it to 1B, they will realise that they were kings before and now too. Let's make their debut MV 1B, let's do it armys. I know we can. Share this as much as you can on every platform in various languages.",0,2021-03-21T15:44:05Z

@btseokdipty4511,"Your limitation—it’s only your imagination.
Push yourself, because no one else is going to do it for you.Great things never come from comfort zones.Dream it. Wish it. Do it.Success doesn’t just find you. You have to go out and get it.The harder you work for something, the greater you’ll feel when you achieve it.Dream bigger. Do bigger.Don’t stop when you’re tired. Stop when you’re done.Wake up with determination. Go to bed with satisfaction.Do something today that your future self will thank you forLittle things make big days.It’s going to be hard, but hard does not mean impossible.Don’t wait for opportunity. Create it.Sometimes we’re tested not to show our weaknesses, but to discover our strengths.The key to success is to focus on goals, not obstacles.
Dream it. Believe it. Build it.
ARMY U CAN DO ANY THING... EVERY ARMY WHO'S WATCHING THIS ..U HAVE A HIDDEN TALENT IN YOU TO MAKE SURE U NEVER LOSE IT
NO MATTER HOW HARD U WORK HOW BIG UR DREAM IS BUT NEVER GIVE UP..

@keepcalmandstanot7.724,"I am impressed by Jimin, he really ran fast. It is important to take the lead from the beginning and he did it!
 And Kookie at the end, I could feel the increased pace at which the camera was moving and he kept a distance with the opponent large enough to even look backand  slow down his speed a little towards the end(that was lowkey savage)
Taehyung and Jhope also ran very fast, it wasn't that visible but none of them let the opponent go ahead of them, making it easier for Kookie ( He still ran at the speed of sound tho)
V with the pony tail tho! How does he manage to look super handsome with anything💜",1852,2018-07-06T05:17:16Z

@divanshi4894,"So like first of all...they all ran super duper well...and they're all really clever with the whole concept of relay races? The first and last runners are really important and Jimin did such a fantastic job of trying his best to get ahead even though one of the guys (I dont know his name but he's wearing a black hoodie) was fast too? and Tae realised that he couldn't slack off cause the guy in the black hoodie had given his team a great start as well, so the competition was still strong? Tae really pushed hard to create a gap. And then after that, Hobi did this world class run to make it nice and smooth in order to maintain the lead. Jungkook finishes it off in style..gaah..its all so pretty <3 :)",0,2018-06-26T07:49:11Z

@nguyenvinh1162,"Hi BTS, I’m from Vietnam . I don’t know any K-pop Singer  even I hate K-pop music before, I seem can’t absorb any melody’song s ultil I watch BTS’s performance in AMAs by the mistake. I can’t belive in my eyes. BTS, you re angles . I totally excited. You bring me aspriration. Your choreography at live performance and all MV official also are awesome. All of you are talent. And honestly, I love Jungkook the most. He is handsome ofcourse but it not enough, he is always full of energy, he dance awesome. He makes me laugh so much on each funny  video that Bangtan TV uploaded. I find all songs which he covered . I lose amzing pure sound and absolutely comfort. There is no word to discrible his voice. I watch all videos again and again anytime I have; when busy or free time, sad of happy not denpend.  I remember the interview by English he said “ I know movie but I don’t know movie’s name  oh, oh, oh….  I know movie but I don’t know movie’s name” oh my God  I laughed as a mad ))) . he made me tear . why he so cute like that :xxx, I watch video abour practices, MV and  stage behind scenes a thousand times not boring, ha ha ha  . Exactly Jongkook is quite shy speak English but his pronunciation sound good and extremely nice in each cover English song, even in my mind full of his images , of course I watch all videos about V, Suga, RM, Jimin and J-Hope  each people have  position in my heart and my mind . I wish, someday I will have a sign all of member’s BTS especially if I have a chance I want to big hug Jungkook “ I NEED” :d . I love BTS and love Jungkook but not as a girl , i love because of his talent, character and spirit which he brings me. The thing I love BTS not other boy band in K-pop  because all of you come together and always happy, take care each other, word hard and improve yourself day by day. Good luck and  I always  give my eyes forward to you. BTS <3
I wish BTS’member will read this message . I HOPE!  all guys I love you so much, do you know about it???!!!",0,2018-03-01T02:37:45Z

Jungkook just ran 100 meters in 14 seconds - AND THAT'S INCLUDING HIM SLOWING DOWN AT THE END! He looks behind him to see where everyone else is, and then slows down. He could've finished that lap even faster if he hadn't slowed down. All of that just means he can run a mile in under 4 minutes. That's less than half the average running time!!!

The second and third runners have to maintain the lead or at least not lag behind in order for the fourth runner to finish first. therefore, thank you jimin for running so well, for taking the initial lead. thank you taehyung for running your hardest and keeping that lead. thank you hoseok for keeping that lead and leaving the other opponents in the dust. thank you jungkook for running like sonic the hedgehog xD thank you seokjin, namjoon and yoongi for cheering the other members on, for giving them support and giving them the strength to run their fastest. thank you bangtan for producing not only nice music, but nice videos (mad funny and crazy ones too :P) and also for completing such feats that make all of your fans proud.

Jimin closed the gap at the beginning real quick. I think no matter you put Jimin at which track, he will definitely catching up and leading the run tho. This year he got the third track and wowwww he closed the gap! omg 
I agree, this year our boys are no joke. I mean, they make it like there isn't any competition at all. They were leading the run!!! 

Jhorse and V! Applause for them for maintaining the run. 
And golden maknae, I don't have to say more.

@dayanes7118,"안녕하세요, 빅히트 엔터테인먼트

우선, 우리는 브라질에서 왔고 전 세계에 모든 아미스의 이름으로 되어 있습니다. 

우리는 방탄소년단에게 그들의 꿈을 실현하기 위해 기회를 주고 그리고 그들이 꿈을 이루고 오늘날 우리에게 그들과 만나게 기회를 준 것에 대한 감사하다는 말을 하고 싶습니다.

매일 이 일곱명의 소년들이 많은 사람들을 행복하게 만들고 그것에 대한 답례로 우리는 항상 그들의 옆에 있을 것임을 소년들이 알 필요가 있습니다.  

음, 이 편지의 목적은 그것이 우리고, 팬이라고 생각하고 말하고 있습니다. 마치 빅히트 엔터테인먼트가 두 멤버사이를 일정한 거리에서 어떻게든 홍보하고 있고 우리는 정말로 사랑해요,

항상 볼 수 있었습니다. 이 두 명은 정말 친구이고 상호작용하고 있고 이들은 TV에서 뿐만아니라 또한 무대에서도 아주 훌륭합니다.

그러나 최근에 우리는 인터뷰와 무대에서 그리고 심지어 팬 싸인회에서 그들을 접촉하는것을 허락하지 않고, 그들이 서로 멀어져 있다는 것을 알게 되었습니다. 

왜 이런일이 있는 건가요? 우리는 그들이 함께 항상 우리에게 웃음을주고 좋은 감정을 만들어 주었던 이 모든 행복이 그리워요...
이 그들 사이의 거리가 슬픔과 실망으로 우리를 떠나게 하고 있어요.

그래서 우리는 당신이 그들의 분열을 멈추게 하고 있는지 그리고 -혹은 -왜 아닌지?- 그들을 한 팀으로 만들수 있는지, 이후 그들의 목소리가 천국처럼 들리는지 우리의 모든 마음으로 묻고 싶어요.

분명히 모든 팬들은 그러길 바라요.

그리고 네, 우리는 단지 또다른 팬들이고 편지를 쓰고 있어요, 그러나 우리는 당신이 이것을 읽고 우리들의 요청을 이해하길 바라요.
 
제발, 우리를 슬프게 만들지 말아요, 우리는 그것이 전처럼 상호작용 되기 위해 자유와 함께하길 원해요. 

이것을 읽어줘서 감사해요 그리고 우리들의 소년들을 잘 보살펴주길!
