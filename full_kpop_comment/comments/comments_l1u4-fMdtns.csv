@gnhmgngm,"울고 싶지 않아
울고 싶지 않아

사랑해서, 사랑한다는 말이
부족해서, 그 어떤 말을 꺼내봐도
너 하나만 아끼던 날 두고서 어디 간 거니
내가 싫어 어어 져서 멀리 간 거니

장난치지 마, 거기 있는 거 알아
나타날 거 같아, 마냥 기다리다
널 찾아가야 돼 찾아가야 돼
지금 울면 못 볼지 모르니까

울고 싶지 않아 (Ay, Ay)
울고 싶지 않아 (Ay, Ay)
눈물은 많지만 (Ay, Ay)
울고 싶지 않아 (Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay)

낯설지 않은 길, 이 길이 낯설다
아는 길 맞는지 내게 또 묻지요 (Amour)
혹시나 그 사람 날 찾고 있지 않을까
나는 지금 널 찾고 있어요

장난치지 마, 거기 있는 거 알아
나타날 거 같아, 마냥 기다리다
널 찾아가야 돼 가야 하는데
눈물 고여 점점 흐려져

울고 싶지 않아 (Ay, Ay)
울고 싶지 않아 (Ay, Ay)
눈물은 많지만 (Ay, Ay)
울고 싶지 않아 (Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay)

난 괜찮아 (안 괜찮아)
너 보고 싶지 않아 (너무 보고 싶어)
맘에 없는 말들로 거짓말이라도 해야 돼 해야 돼
생각처럼 맘이 말을 듣지 않으니까
돌아와 돌아와 돌아와
절반이 없는데 어떻게 하나로 살아 (울고 싶지 않아)

울고 싶지 않아 

사랑해서 사랑한다는 말이 
부족해서 그 어떤 말을 꺼내봐도 
너 하나만 아끼던 날 두고서 어디 간 거니 
내가 싫어 어어 져서 멀리 간 거니 

장난치지 마 거기 있는 거 알아 
나타날 거 같아 마냥 기다리다 
널 찾아가야 돼 찾아가야 돼 
지금 울면 못 볼지 모르니까 

울고 싶지 않아 
울고 싶지 않아 
눈물은 많지만 
울고 싶지 않아 

낯설지 않은 길 이 길이 낯설다 
아는 길 맞는지 내게 또 묻지요 
혹시나 그 사람 날 찾고 있지 않을까 
나는 지금 널 찾고 있어요 

장난치지 마 거기 있는 거 알아 
나타날 거 같아 마냥 기다리다 
널 찾아가야 돼 가야 하는데 
눈물 고여 점점 흐려져 

울고 싶지 않아 
울고 싶지 않아 
눈물은 많지만 
울고 싶지 않아 

난 괜찮아 (안 괜찮아) 
너 보고 싶지 않아 (너무 보고 싶어) 
맘에 없는 말들로 거짓말이라도 해야 돼 해야 돼 

생각처럼 맘이 말을 듣지 않으니까 
돌아와 돌아와 돌아와 
절반이 없는데 어떻게 하나로 살아 
울고 싶지 않아

울고 싶지 않아 
눈물은 많지만

@mahammaqsood9381,"If you know seventeen, synchronisation doesnt even seem to be the main highlight for this choreography. For me its how they acted out the lyrics so well while still staying on beat. For most groups its either the lyrics or the beat. If you read the lyrics and then see the choreography, its clearly visible how well they have encoded the actions and the attempts of keeping yourself in control, not to crumble down 2:12 but act as if its okay. How they pull their legs in order to collect themself at one point 1:08, heck even the way they walk during 1:27 alone says a lot about the meaning of song, theres desperation and a sense of urgency at 1:48, the part at 2:26 is just love, they get down on their knees as if they have lost everything with the realization and then theres strong dancing and then again they stand facing the sky and then they look down again. 
Throughout the choreo, they're controlling and caging themselves and are walking on thin ice with very calculated movements knowing that a little more freedom and truth to their actions will only make them lose it completely. I can literally go about it all day but im not good with words. I love this song so much i swear i do, the lyrics, the melody, the choreography, the expression EVERYTHING.",0,2021-08-15T22:37:00Z

@weirdstuff1019,I can't believe this song is three years old already..I keep coming back and the thought of me getting old one day and foforgetting I wanted to marry these dudes makes me wanna cry but then again the song title..this is so nostalgic and brings back so much memories of the hard times back then and now that I think about it I'd wanna go back even if it was hard because when I'd hear people blasting this everywhere I'd feel at peace but it seems like a lot of people are forgetting this masterpiece..I love them and this song so !much long live seventeen<3,1,2020-06-01T19:02:41Z

울고 싶지 않아
사랑해서 사랑한다는 말이
부족해서 그 어떤 말을 꺼내봐도
너 하나만 아끼던 날 두고서
어디 간 거니
내가 싫어 어어 져서
멀리 간 거니
장난치지 마 거기 있는 거 알아
나타날 거 같아 마냥 기다리다
널 찾아가야 돼 찾아가야 돼
지금 울면 못 볼지 모르니까
울고 싶지 않아
울고 싶지 않아
눈물은 많지만
울고 싶지 않아
낯설지 않은 길 이 길이 낯설다
아는 길 맞는지 내게 또 묻지요
혹시나 그 사람
날 찾고 있지 않을까
나는 지금 널 찾고 있어요
장난치지 마 거기 있는 거 알아
나타날 거 같아 마냥 기다리다
널 찾아가야 돼 가야 하는데
눈물 고여 점점 흐려져
울고 싶지 않아
울고 싶지 않아
눈물은 많지만
울고 싶지 않아
난 괜찮아
안 괜찮아
너 보고 싶지 않아
너무 보고 싶어
맘에 없는 말들로
거짓말이라도
해야 돼 해야 돼
생각처럼 맘이
말을 듣지 않으니까
돌아와 돌아와 돌아와
절반이 없는데
어떻게 하나로 살아
울고 싶지 않아
울고 싶지 않아
울고 싶지 않아
눈물은 많지만
울고 싶지 않아
울고 싶지 않아

@epic-k1217,"This video and Seventeen will forever own the most precious corner of my heart.  Almost two years ago, this was my introduction into the wonderful and captivating universe of K-pop.  From the very first line of the song , I felt the sweet sadness of the lyrics (I certainly had NO idea what they were singing about) and the dancing conveyed an inner struggle of emotions in a way that was captivating.  The looks, the tones, the harmonies, the movements, and well, gotta be honest, the members themselves were all so flawless.  And even though I knew it was born from countless hours of practice and monotonous repetition, it struck me how genuine it still felt.  I got sucked under the Hallyu wave so hard that I still haven't come up for air.  I began studying K-pop culture, then Korean culture, then Korean, and of course consuming more K-pop than any grown adult my age should be comfortable admitting to.  And it all began to change me...there is some magic that began to work and connect to my inner self and set me free.  I have come to live life more brightly, fully confident and at peace with myself and the world around me thanks to this remarkable journey.  A journey that began right here.  울고 싶지 않아, but not to despair, this song will always bring happy tears.  감사합니다 세븐틴!",2,2020-02-08T01:39:17Z

@merlincristina921,"Don't Wanna Cry

Não Quero Chorar

Não quero chorar
Não quero chorar

Porque -eu te amo-, porque as palavras -eu te amo-
Não são o suficiente, não importa o que eu diga
Eu te amava tanto, para onde você foi?
Você foi para longe porque não gostava mais de mim?

Não brinque, eu sei que você está ai
Eu sinto que você aparecerá, então estou apenas esperando
Eu preciso te encontrar, preciso te encontrar
Se eu chorar agora, talvez eu não veja você

Não quero chorar
Não quero chorar
Eu tenho muitas lágrimas, mas
Não quero chorar

O caminho que costumava ser familiar, agora é desconhecido
Esse é o caminho que conheço?, eu me pergunto
E se ela estiver procurando por mim?
Eu estou te procurando agora

Não brinque, eu sei que você está ai
Eu sinto que você aparecerá, então estou apenas esperando
Eu preciso te encontrar, preciso te encontrar
Se eu chorar agora, talvez eu não veja você

Não quero chorar
Não quero chorar
Eu tenho muitas lágrimas, mas
Não quero chorar

Eu estou bem (não estou bem)
Eu não sinto sua falta (eu sinto tanto a sua falta)
Com palavras que eu nem quero dizer, mesmo que elas sejam mentiras, eu preciso dizer

Meu coração não vai ouvir como eu quero
Volte, volte, volte
Minha outra metade não está aqui, então, como poderei viver completo?
(Não quero chorar)

Não quero chorar
Não quero chorar
Eu tenho muitas lágrimas, mas
Não quero chorar

Não quero chorar
Quando nos vermos de novo
Não quero chorar",1,2017-10-16T16:41:48Z

@wonwoojeonwonwoo,"FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO BE CARATS:
HERE ARE SOME INFO ABOUT SEVENTEEN AND WAYS ON HOW TO KNOW/SUPPORT THEM!
1. YES THEY WROTE, COMPOSED AND CHOREOGRAPHED THIS SONG AND ALL OF THEIR SONGS 
2. 13 MEMBERS + 3 UNITS +1 TEAM = SEVENTEEN (NOW YOU WONT NEED TO FIND THE 4 MISSING MEMBERS COZ THAT EQUATION IS THE REAL ONE HAHAHA)
3. MEANIE IS THE MAIN SHIP ( WONWOO AND MINGYU)
4.THERE ARE 3 UNITS - VOCAL, HIPHOP AND PERFORMANCE
5. THE GREEN HAIRED GUY (THE ONE WHO LOOKS LIKE A HIGHLIGHTER) IS NOT THE MAKNAE
6. YOU CAN CHOOSE ANYONE AND CREATE YOUR BIAS LIST BUT BEWARE OF ALL THE MEMBERS COZ THEYRE ALL BIAS WRECKERS
7. CARATS CAN ALSO BE CALLED AS CARROTS :)
8.THEYRE FROM PLEDIS!!! YAS AND I KNOW (WE ALL KNOW) THAT THEY WILL SHINE MORE :)
9. PLEASE WATCH THE M/V MORE!!!
10. I RECOMMEND WATCHING ALL OF THEIR SPECIAL VIDEOS ON THEIR YOUTUBE ACCOUNT
11. FOLLOW ALL OF THEIR SNS ACCOUNTS 
12. GIVE LOVE TO SEVENTEEN <3 
13. DONT WATCH MR REMOVED COZ YOU'LL BE DISAPPOINTED COZ YOU'LL FEEL LIKE YOURE JUST WATCHING THE SAME PERFORMANCE VIDEO :) (THEYRE SINGING LIVE LEGIT!!!)",31,2017-06-04T12:39:23Z

@violetartem1034,"Hey guys. I'm not seeking attention or anything but I have this girlfriend who jumped off the balcony last night..but she survived and also had no broken bones and it was a double miracle. She is in the hospital right now and her mother brought the Going Seeventeen album to the hospital and when she woke up, she saw the album and started crying (this is all what her mother said) as she started talking to the album.. she was bullied for over 4 years and she did a lot of suicide attempts..her name is Sumire but seventeen has stopped her from suicide, suicidal thoughts (only for a while) and self harming as she always thanked Seventeen for always saving her life. She started to have a dream of becoming one of their members..and last night she got heart broken by her best friend...and back to the thing about the hospital, she has been talking to the album for an hour saying she is sorry for trying to kill herself. But also thanking them.. I remember her saying that she believes in herself and for seventeen to wait for a few years and she is a lil different. Why? Because when her friend say her bias will be their future husband or calling them ""your man"" it makes her angry...before she tried to suicide, she threw a desk at the boy who made fun of her dream, and also abused him..she is just traumatized..I hope you guys understand. I'm sorry if this triggered you but she is all okay now...she has been talking to the album all day..like it's her best friend and hugging it while crying.. thanks for reading this long message.

@bubulia,"Okay this is going to be along cheesy rant but I absolutely love this group so much and I can never find the words to express me love and support for them. Seventeen is the only kpop group in the history of my kpop career that I have loved so deeply. I love all the members, all the songs, all their albums and merch. Before svt I was never able to fully like a kpop group to the point of wanting to get to know the members and their personalities or buy an album. The first time I saw the Adore U mv something inside me told me to explore them further and I am so blessed that I did. I remember the exact moment when I fell in love with them was when I saw the Adore U live vid and at the end of the choreo they did this falling over leg move and I just remembered how absolutely in snyc and lively in performance was. It was at that exact moment when I finally realized how other fans felt about their bias groups that I never experienced. It was from then on that I have given my undivided attention and unwavering support for seventeen and they have NEVER ceased to impress me with their energy, motivation, talent and dedication. Sounds stupid and over the top but their music has really helped me through though times when I felt so low in life. The fact that they were rookies in a small company and are now spoken about with some of the best in the industry such as BTS and EXO is incredible. Watching the interaction and support between members really makes me feel like they've found where they belong and are living their dreams at the moment fully with wonderful friends. Hearing about them working themselves to the point of injury makes me feel worried but also a sense of overflowing pride for these 13 boys. I wish nothing but love, happiness, prosperity and success for these boys and when they go on their tour, I want them to see how many hearts they've touched all over the world with their blood sweat and tears.",0,2017-05-30T00:05:44Z

@hanahhanah1341,"I love the song, the choreo, everything. I've been wanting to indulge myself into them and be a carat for the longest time ever since they debuted but I can't do so because I'm still scared after taorishan happened with EXO. I loved them so hard that I'm still broken right now. I'm so scared that history will repeat itself. I love svt but I just can't bring myself to fully love them.

Not to mention this really beautiful fandom. I was going through some of the comments and dude I can't. I see the early (beautiful) stages of every fandom where it's all positive and I love that. There are only a few fandoms which have carried out that stage even until their artist got old. And I wish carat will be one of those. I'm a multifandom fan myself so I've seen lots of different fandoms and carat is one of the best.

I hope someday I can bring myself to overcome my 'trauma' (😂) and love these boys with all my harteu.

Really, this choreography is so beautiful and emotional; and all of the members were so in sync! Really impressive :)! 
I definitely will check out more Seventeen songs :)!

@minniej9096,I applaud Hoshi for choreographing this dance because it's hard to choreograph for that many people and have it turn out this well. I applaud Woozi for producing this song because it's stressful to make something that pleases everyone but he tries his best anyways. I applaud all of Seventeen for being able to withstand the kpop industry while still having the passion of 13 strong-willed people because that's who they are. This is what you call perfection.,0,2017-05-29T15:29:26Z

@radish1395,"So the thing about this choreography is that it is not only different than what Hosh and their choreographer have come up with in the past, it also adds to the story and the emotion of the song. I'm not an expert on dance but I really like when I see something in the performance aspect of groups, like I do here. The song is about heartbreak, but I want to think there is a little more to it, a little more personal (like when you're heartbroken about anything, not just a love ending).

The movements are shaky, almost robotic, in the choruw,  and when you experience heartbreak but you're trying to hide it, you tend to lose yourself and slip into a ""default mode"" of yourself. The characters they're playing for these performances are fighting the tears, but that takes a lot of effort, so they're not themselves. 

But in the verses, they move fluidly (and sadly, tbh) because they're alone, essentially. They're embracing what they're feeling more. This is especially true for Woozi's modern-esque moves and Coupsy/Jeonghan walking under the (handsome) streetlamps. 

Then the bridge (where Wonwoo steals the show; this is his era y'all), Meanie are moving through the boys and I think that represents all the times you have to pretend to be okay when you're hurting. You move around and navigate until you're alone again. And it's just hard... until you break and you crumble (them falling to their knees in the last chorus).

The last chorus is choppy and not as robotic... that's why you break, when you need to let yourself cry, feel, admit what's going on with you, even to yourself. 

THIS IS JUST ME OKAY I COULD BE WRONG BUT HOSH LOVES DANCE TOO MUCH NOT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF STORYTELLING IN A SONG LIKE THIS",2,2017-05-29T15:17:15Z
