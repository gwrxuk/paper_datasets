@kindavocado,10:18 I'm just re-watching all GoSe and realized that this is where DK and his desire to be class president started. Not Mingyu coming after him saying he'll be the class president and Mingyu really did became the class president of Gose 2024. The perfect example of having a goal (DK) and manifesting a goal (Mingyu). They didn't change at all I'm crying,383,2024-08-16T05:32:35Z

@JordynNexus,Omg the roll call is such a throwback 🤣😭 my first year of high school (I went to a school that had primary and high school at the same place) it suddenly occurred to us how much fun it would be if we swapped names and called out all sorts of bullshit instead of just saying “yes” to our names and seeing how much we could get away with before the teacher realised because they were new teachers who obviously didn’t know any of us.

1. When jeonghan came to classroom they sang almost paradise. 
2. When dino had to switch roles hurriedly. 
3. When everyone wants to be seated next to Joshua & noone wants Mr. Boo
Last but not least
4. The legendary table tennis match between jeonghan & Joshua

( I love their editors so much... Their added points are so funny.. My favorite when jeonghan used two balls the editors called him 'magician' & woozi who lost, they called him ' a muggle who is no match')",914,2022-08-30T05:49:40Z

@loryyy_sv,"I was like too young when Boys Over Flowers came out and I'd watched it with my older cousin back then(keep in mind k.culture wasn't even a hit yet) then I'd watch it years later in my first year of highschool when kpop suddenly started rising in popularity.

So I think they don't need to worry about young kids these days not knowing it cuz like, when you're starting in kdrama, I think it's one of those classic ones a kdrama person would recommend. Specially since the internet is much more accessible now with high quality compared to back then. 

We only depended on CDs at the time Lol, worse case scenerio was when you lend it to your classmates and they get scratched a bit, then the quality of the video itself is affected😔. Internet was like for the rich in back then, but even then it wasn't still as good of a quality as we have today...

1. Make your ball unconscious, either shake is violently or let it perform a seventeen choreography, it will pass out in a second
2. Create an electric field by rubbing your ball against your racquet, this is extremely important
3. Shout BLAST BURST SHOT and serve the ball

@mvu2465,"I'm sorry if there are negativities in my comment in the content that I enjoy so much, but I have to ask, sincerely: Can Gose team change their Vietnamese translator, please? 
Starting from the first episode when the Vietsub was added, I and some Vietnamese comments mentioned the wrong pronouns, and then there are several translating mistakes that I can easily point out. Undoubtedly these mistakes come from word-by-word translating, and there are some lines that the translator just simply keeps the English lines, not bothering to translate them. 
For example, in this video, in the line where the caption was about Jeonghan's Adam's apple, the Vietnamese caption was ""uvula"" in Vietnamese??? 
Another example: The part when Jeonghan called out Joshua, which was originally said: ""조슈지 나와"", the Vietnamese sub was ""Joshuaji and I""???
As a translator myself, these silly little mistakes trigger me a lot. In every episode that has Vietsub until this one, there are at least 2 or so silly mistakes like this. Luckily, these mistakes haven't changed the meaning much, but what if? What if there are more serious translating mistakes in the future that may affect Seventeen and Gose?
I posted a comment in Vietnamese directly to the Vietnamese translator in the last episode, asking the translator to put more effort into the translating process if he/she received translating payment from Gose team. Apparently, there are no changes shown in this episode. To be very honest, there are Vietsub from fans that are: 1. free and 2. accurate and 3. super hilarious, therefore, I see no point of enduring this kind of translating. But V-Carats decided that we should focus on the main channel for the view and other kinds of stuff, so, well :( 
Just change the Vietnamese translator please :(",0,2021-11-17T16:22:31Z

Seokmin : The most loud students
Mingyu : The ambitious one
Seungkwan : The loud and sensitive one
Jeonghan : Flower boys, genius
Joshua : The most favorite cz genius and handsome
Scoups : strong and serious
Wonwoo : The serious one
Vernon : Handsome and serious
Woozi : Introvert provocator
Hoshi : The Introvert and extrovert
Dino :  still VICTIM OF HIS 12 BROTHER hahahaa
Jun and The 8 : student exchange

Once, without smartphone :
Break time--> play sport(tennis, badminton, football), hide and seek, SOS
We can fight and laugh, we share one moment in time.

@likhaarticraftsph,"Just my observation:

Dino's iconic laugh is over the place again. DK and Hoshi as usual are the mood makers.  Vernon and Wonwoo are quiet as usual but very cooperative. Jeonghan is the epitome of cleverness. Joshua is so innovative, cool and funny at the same time.  SCoups is there proudly watching his sons 😁. Seungkwan is  the apple of the eye ahahhahhaa..  Mingyu and Woozi are there to support everything, best reactors. Missing Jun and The8 but still happy for them being able to be with their fam abroad.  

To GoSe staff..  Kamsahamnida for paving the way so that uri Seventeen  have this kind of opportunity to not just do contents but a show that they can showcase their talents individually and their chemistry as a group.  Job well done.  💎",44,2021-11-17T13:10:10Z
