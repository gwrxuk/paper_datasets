@naott,"This perfomance is amazing. It takes your breath away. I like how the overall essence of each dancer was constructed so that they can mesh with the group, but still each has their own style, and they work well together. Taemin and his fellow backdancers do something similar. That helps everyone stand out for their amazing work and still doesn't lose the center (Hoshi). i love it!
I love how each step syncs perfectly with the music and they tell the lyrics of the song somehow, perfectly conveying the main idea. It stands out among other artists in its quality.
And I also really liked the constant play with the camera angle.",2,2021-07-17T22:27:40Z

@Sugarpuff194,"Obviously, I don’t know anything about Hoshi’s personal life beyond what he puts forward, nor should any fan… but are others getting wonderfully casual bi vibes from this choreo?

- Hoshi says in the“BEHIND” video that “the lyrics mean that I’m trapped in the other person’s spider web, but that I like being trapped.” Both men and women perform trapping moves in every version--whether the dancers are embracing Hoshi or tossing him around, he doesn’t seem disinclined about either. 

- There’s the even split of backup dancers wearing white or black shirts. That’s one binary. I’m not entirely certain what the black/white represents (style of attraction?), but it’s reasonable to assume that that was a choice. Now, I don’t know a thing about how bisexuality is represented in Korea, but Hoshi’s outfits (either gray or black-and-white by version) suggest to me that, for the video, he embodies both opposing ends of a binary and exists somewhere in the middle.

- We see him caught in the middle again when the dancers make their web formations. The men block the front of the pull-up bar tunnel (0:34) and the women block the back (3:30). Hoshi becomes physically positioned between two opposing ends.

- Just a small detail: in the chorus, we see one move distinctly repeated. It comes first while Hoshi’s among women (0:57) and then later again with the men (2:16). This repeat, the vocal affirmation of “yeah,” and the general thottiness of the move collectively feels significant, at least to me.

- Also, in the “M COUNTDOWN” version, the dancers all wear gender-obscuring masks, which is interesting. The intro shows Hoshi acting on desire with a group, where he gives no visible preference to anyone. He embraces the entire group by tying their hands, “trapping” them the way they’ve “trapped” him.

Again, Hoshi’s sexuality is his business, unless he puts anything forth stating otherwise. I can’t imagine the potential trauma of being a queer man in the kpop industry, and I don’t take the discussion lightly. However, I find the possibility of queer artistry being represented here really exciting and brave as hell. In short, Hoshi’s moves are astonishing, this performance is INCREDIBLY creative, and of course: Horanghae",0,2021-06-18T03:47:53Z

First he's hanging like what a spider would then he'd get caught in a web made out of girls while trying to run away, next moment he's doing 4 legs with the backup dancer and the second he's getting dragged again while trying to escape? There's so many other details that the more u watch the video the more you realize how filled to the brim with little tiny metaphors the choreography is. Absolutely amazing.

@kakaobaecker1511,"This performance is gold.
I often don't like the use of backup dancers in Kpop - when the stage is crowded with people dancing the same choreography as the idol and sometimes equally as good (they are professional dancers after all), just to fill the stage. In my opinion, that doesn't feel necessary and makes the idol stand out less.

But these aren't used as ""backup"" dancers, they are important to the choreography! So many amazing, smart and new formations - and Hoshi being the protagonist of the performance! 
And tbh, with his skills and stage presence he TOTALLY still stands out while doing the same moves as everyone else...damn he could tie his shoe and I'd think it was part of the performance lol",0,2021-04-11T15:43:12Z

@desirieasis8114,"Spider's Stage performance and Mv is mesmerizing already. But seeing a Choreography Video where all choreo is shown, the performance is more focused, you can also see what the dancers are doing and the actual change formations... It's just so undescribably amazing and it's a perfection. This is the quality the Performance Unit Leader of SEVENTEEN can give.",0,2021-04-11T14:45:32Z

@thisbrightlight4047,"Gahhhhhhhh, IT'S THE MUSICALITY AND ATTENTION TO DETAIL FOR ME! First of all, it takes me 10 minutes to get past the instrumental in the beginning because I can't ever stop watching the way he isolates every finger to wrap his hands around the prop, his head leaning back just before he lets go, and those dang delicate sways looking like he is in no way hanging upside down using  just his legs 😦 I've listened to the song a million times since it was released and the way he moves is making different nuances in the back of the track just jump out at me. He is so clean and intentional when he dances, it just-- ughhhhh. Hoshi ate this performance all the way up. He is unreal.

Shoutout to the dancers too. They were killing it. This choreo wouldn't work if they weren't fully committed to the performance quality in their bodies and each one of them completely goes for it.",0,2021-04-11T14:29:56Z

@BenjieAtTheDoor,"CAN WE ALL AGREE THAT HOSHI IS ONE OF THE BEST SOLOISTS WE'VE SEEN?! THIS IS A MASTERPIECE! 🐯👏

The minute he started dancing while hanging upside down, I know this is worth watching! Every detail was well thought of - the intensity of the piece, the control of movements, the shifts of energy from a hard hitting/intricate step to a more subtle move to an even smoother transition, the use of the props, the tricks & little representations, and most especially the power that Hoshi gave throughout the performance. Without doubt, he killed this one! Plus his visuals! Kudos to you, Kwon Soonyoung! HORANGHAE! ❤

This choreo video speaks of itself. It's an amazing choreography! And I can say, THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST CREATIVE, ARTISTIC, AND VISUALLY PLEASING CHOREOGRAPHY FROM A KPOP SOLOIST! 🙌",0,2021-04-11T14:28:44Z

@neon-cn2dh,"How to describe hoshi of seventeen?why?

A. Tiger
B. Hamster
C. Spider

My Answer:
D. All of the above
Why? 
A. As cool and dangerous like a real tiger while he is dancing on the stage
B.while off stage he is as cute as a hamster,,,eats like a hamster,sleeps like a hamster,loos like a hamster😂
C. When you see him on stage some might get trapped and once you get trapped you can't break free
On a real spider sooner or later you will become food
But in hoshi version you will become a carat

@stutipando2052,"You're too good hoshi.. I'm loving it. Love you. For your hardwork you're the main dancer .im Stuti ,a Christian Girl and also a dancer. I was too girly at the age till 11 but when i turn 12 then i became a tomboy and started to dance.. I feel like dance is my passion so i tried practicing dance.. But my dance was really bad due to the absence of dancing skills but when i started to watch K-pop especially Seventeen then the spirit came into my body and i told myself that i will be the best dancer at my church. I'll try my best to prove it because Jesus is with me and whole K-pop groups are with me especially seventeen.. I love watching seventeen .They dance so perfectly. They are the king of synchronization and among them my bias is jun and hoshi. I love hoshi's dance the most. So I started doing his style and i become the best dancer at my church and everyone says that my dancing is the best. And also asks me that -stuti - do you have a backbone??  Because you dance like butter, like a rubber 😆i feel so good that people likes my dance and made the bestest dancer... It's all because Jesus and my dear hoshi.. Jesus gave me the ability to learn hoshi's style and now I'm very perfect at dancing.. So thank you so much hoshi ,you are my inspiration and you are the best and the main dancer ..saranghae 💖💖💖💖",0,2021-04-11T13:30:47Z

If you are not a carat and just here to spam and get likes: guess what, it's not cool, go and search for your validtion from others somewhere else.
