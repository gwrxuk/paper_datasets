@Debs-e7z,How cute & confident is baby Samuel... happy his passion for music got success. Yet it was too much too soon for the 10yr old... Funny to see how much taller than Woozi he has become in their dance challenge...gaps are open & he is old enough to reunite now. Wish he'd come back.. Ooh my bias prince Jun didn't have to make an effort & of course model Mingyu got me feeling like hot😍😍🤴🏻🤵🏻🔥🔥❤❤,0,2025-03-06T00:54:25Z

So much love to Seventeen members .
Its just too overwhelmed situation to see them here as a starter or a new explorer of their dream and today to know them as a most amazing successful and lovable group .
It represent the journey of how we start from start and how it takes our passion ,hardwork, patience , consistency, to keep going on .

@johmblebee,"Actually, he's probably posing like that because he has the modeling experience. If you notice how he usually stands during their broadcasts, it tends to look like he's ""posing"" all the time. I think it's because he has bowed legs, which tends to be regarded as unappealing, and so he was probably taught how to stand so that it's not as noticeable. :)",0,2013-04-27T17:24:36Z

While Seventeen are all young. And if you watch 17tv, you should know that Samuel doesn't stay late in the practice room. He leaves it earlier.

Noona = how a boy would call an older girl in Korea
Noona =/= a older girl who sexually assault younger boys as a hobby, kay?
Besides, you are not a noona when you are like 1 month older, okay? Seeing ""I'm a noona, I'm 5 months older than him °o°"" kinda irritates me.
