pVomGgRdKb8,UgzMH101rTYGBE6NhKF4AaABAg,@BansheePurple,UCnAFIBAdKgXelMpyq7MyoGw,"I love the fact the right owner of the ""Paved the way"" finally claim that sht in a track! I'm honestly so happy now they are talking about it bc some were already taking the credit 💀 

Also, many fandoms were already attacking him the first time he said ""that's funny, but it's true"" on weverse live. Many kpoppies started calling Army just as delusional and narcissist as the guys and welp...  I love his ""Call me a narcissist, like a typhoon, be an artist and be honest” verse for this song too!! HE ATE THAT 🔥 

Of course, some started again complaining and making stupid comments without knowing the real  meaning of paving the way and the fact Namjoon re-confirmed that BTS PAVED THE WAY on IG stories immediately was the best! 😂  I LOVE HIM

Like Megan said in her song 'NDA' ""Sick of bein humble 'cause you btches don't respect that"" and in her song 'Not Nice'
""Fck it, btch, I'm not nice, I'm the shit I'm done with bein' humble 'cause I know that I'm that btch"" 

I'm so here for it. BTS is humble for sure BUT they can also flex the truth 🔥",9,2024-09-07T05:54:46Z,,0
