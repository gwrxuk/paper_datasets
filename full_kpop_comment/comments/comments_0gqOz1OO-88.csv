So many things happened,a 🎢 🤣but it was fun,it was worth it. I enjoyed being an army(not so much lately unfortunately)we did a great job💜bts were something unique,something we cherished and loved and army were thankful everytime they called our fandom name in any event.....bts were always proud of their fans,it wasn't only about money but more about recognition.

@shilpashetty2005,"Everyone talking about how fast they are and I agree with that but am I the only one who got worried when the two players fall down 1:39 I was like dude what if they got injured, the one with red stick tried to give the stick to his teammate even tho he fall down but couldn't cuz if it slipped from his hand and started rolling away. And the another guy also tried but couldn't cuz his teammate stop running and came near him same another one and the last track guy had to slow down cuz the red one fall rite beside him. So it lead to Jungkook running alone but I am happy that BTS won. And also sad that other two runners can't get to run again cuz they were with their teammate and lasy one had to slow down. You can even see how it had small crowd of runners except BTS and the last track one.",1,2021-03-08T10:23:56Z

You can see his leg speeding up. We need a Match  between him and JK. I really want to see who is fast because JK is kind of in an advantage position. He is given the baton as a first position runner  so it’s just for him to finish what the others started well.  But Jimin is running from the same position and starter with other runners and still gives them so much distance. If you watch other relay races, you will see what am saying.

@الواثقباللهالمتوكلعلىالله-ش5م,"إن من أعظم الواجبات الدينية الأمر بالمعروف والنهي عن المنكر، قال الله تعالى: [وَلْتَكُنْ مِنْكُمْ أُمَّةٌ يَدْعُونَ إِلَى الْخَيْرِ وَيَأْمُرُونَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ وَأُولَئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ]. 
روي عن النبي (صلى الله عليه وآله) أنه قال: (كيف بكم إذا فسدت نساؤكم، وفسق شبابكم، ولم تأمروا بالمعروف ولم تنهوا عن المنكر) فقيل له: ويكون ذلك يا رسول الله؟ قال صلى الله عليه وآله: (نعم). فقال: (كيف بكم إذا أمرتم بالمنكر، ونهيتم عن المعروف) فقيل له: يا رسول الله ويكون ذلك؟ فقال: (نعم وشر من ذلك كيف بكم إذا رأيتم المعروف منكراً والمنكر معروفاً؟). 
وقد روي عنهم (عليهم السلام): أن بالأمر بالمعروف تقام الفرائض وتأمن المذاهب، وتحل المكاسب، وتمنع المظالم، وتعمر الأرض وينتصف للمظلوم من الظالم، ولا يزال الناس بخير ما أمروا بالمعروف، ونهوا عن المنكر، وتعاونوا على البر، فإذا لم يفعلوا ذلك نزعت منهم البركات وسلط بعضهم على بعض، ولم يكن لهم ناصر في الأرض ولا في السماء.",0,2020-10-09T13:32:01Z

*WHY* DOESN'T the American talk shows talk about BTS doing *THIS* .. *INSTEAD OF* the *EXACT SAME BOOOOOOORING QUESTIONS??????*
Questions I would ask:  Tell me about *HOW* it was like competing with your fellow Idols?
Would you *consider* doing an ""American"" version of it.. like ""The Battle of the Network Stars"" .. except ""music"" version???
On American Hustle Life.. I noticed V having a *cast* on his wrist.. how did he *break* it?  And *how* did it *heal* so fast.. that the cast was taken off soon after.. within the two weeks they were staying in L.A?
Would Jimin *EVER* consider doing an ""American"" version of the Masked Singer?
After their military service.. would *ANY* of them *consider* hosting a *game show???*
Would Jin *EVER* consider acting on American movie screens.. once Covid 19 is over?
Since *their* Idol *Drake* mentioned backstage at an awards show, that he would host BTS when they come to Toronto... would they take his offer seriously???
Does BTS *EVER* respond to YouTube comments *directly*???  And *if* so..  by being themselves or by an alias???",7,2020-10-08T03:58:05Z

@chroniclesofervil,"The saddest thing from this bomb was they worked so hard, only get to shows like this that exploit fandoms to buying tickets and support them and they had to work their ass off becoz ppl thought they're ""young"" so they must be so damn fit to do such activities. 
Whereas, variety shows like running man prefer to use actors/actress who often thought to be more elegant, wise and able to do stuff there.",1,2019-04-24T12:56:55Z
