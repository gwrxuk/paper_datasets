@carat_mia4902,"I love the little energizing yells they put in the background while a member is singing. This just shows they put 120% into their performances because they don't want to just perform the song, they want to make it special so carats will remember it.

@lindsay199_8,"I don't get why people are complaining about Jun having few lines here when in the first place this was an old song (2016). If you look at the present now, he has more lines on the title track song. If you all are really a Jun stan, you should know that he gets to sing to other tracks in the album. He's a member of performance unit, let's face the fact that they give more lines to vocal unit in every title track okay? There's no use in complaining.",5,2019-09-13T14:58:51Z

@heyitsmira17,"I always... ALWAYS cry when watching any Pretty U performance, for some reason. It all starts cute and fun, but around the ""I can't take it no more"", my heart becomes a bit heavy, then during DK and Seungkwan's lines it just gets harder and harder, but what triggers my tears is the ""Seventeen, saranghae, yeppeuda!"" fanchant. I just cried for 5 minutes bc of Pretty U again, I _really_ can't take it no more orz. 

Maybe it's because it was my first era and their first win, or bc the song is so beautiful and full of feelings idk I am just crying alone at home while filled with the same joy I had 3 years ago. Seventeen, thank you for everything you've given me as a carat. I really love you guys. Have a happy chuseok ♡ and maybe someday please consider coming to Brazil ;-----;",2,2019-09-13T14:37:55Z

@watermelonshua3278,"So apparently, Vernon's family has moved to a new house and it's near to DK's which made the two families become neighbors 😃
Hoshi said DK's older sister is getting married.
The boys spoiled us so much today. On Twitter, fancafe and even vlive.
All the members are now in their hometowns, resting, celebrating Chuseok with their families. Except Joshua Jun and Minghao who celebrate at the dorm. But I'm sure they will also be happy together. 😃💓",1,2019-09-13T12:59:22Z
