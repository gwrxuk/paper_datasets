NOT TO MENTION THE DETAILS IN EVERY ROUTINE. Like from head, to hands, fingers, feet, and so on. Need I say more about their formation? Man, this is the reason why I haven't learned the full choreography of the song because I find it very challenging. ONLY SEVENTEEN CAN PERFECT THE CHOREOGRAPHY. NO ONE COMES CLOSE.
