@KxNOxUTA,"I'm forever amazed about people struggling to do some basic thinking and researching (just scroll down) and keep asking what was going on with Felix. He was injured at the time the video was taken (I'm reading it was supposedly a back injury). 

It's life, they're athletes in many aspects within their business. Sometimes you'll see times where members have health concerns, especially the longer they're working in public. They are working so hard, surely we can be expected to do the very simple work of figuring out the answer to our own very simple question?! Given the natures of such concerns and comment sections, the answers are usually only a few scrolls away. 

I personally appreciate this video for normalising that idols are humans with bad times, not performance machines. They smartly included him into the performance while minding his health and I really appreciate that approach❣",0,2025-03-23T01:14:45Z

@nicolerodriguez5764,"Everyone's dancing was great but I really can't take my eyes off Minho. Lately I've been paying more attention to Stray Kids, before I knew Danceracha's lineup but I wasn't very involved in the fandom so I didn't look in depth, but seeing more about the boys I've been fascinated by Minho's dance skills. I don't know how to explain it but it's something about the control he has over his body and how detailed each of his movements are, the fluidity that his body has is captivating, he also has the influence of some genres in his way of dancing, something that is very cool to see and if you ask me I would like to take dance classes  with this guy because he is truly a professional.",0,2023-06-10T05:17:05Z

@sinevins,"This was interesting, I like Stray Kids in their own way, and really like some of what I have seen in their mv's. But honestly their dance practices rather caught me by surprise. Speaking as someone eith dance experience, I mean not a ton, but some, I am a bit disappointed. They seem to ne hyped up, and their mv's are very striking, but honestly it seems this might be an area the can continue to improve in. Can definitely tell there are different levels of damcing skill, and quite often the energy is up and down. Which can be seen more clearly in some moves that are done eith a bit of lackluster, or a bit sloppy, the energy and execution just isn't there. But later that might not be the case for that same member. Seem like they are doing a lot and maybe that could be an issue, not sure. But it does seem like they could all use more time focusing on just making their basics stronger. Maybe trying some popping exercises might help as well. I want to say, I think a couple lessons with Jhope might so them wonders. Because the choreo seems to definitely have those hitting moments, where if those movements were a bit sharper, it would really pop, so to speak, lol. And when the are synchronized they def. look good, and I loved the ripple turns, it was nice, clean and destinct! Very nice!!!
But I think this is also a bit older of a video, so I am hoping they will continue to work on their synchronization, because cleaning that up can make such a huge difference, especially in a routine ehere there are a lot of things going on, but that they are doing very distinct movements one by one to make up one bigger movement when put altogether. I would say they definitely have potential, hopefully they have kept trying to sharpen their routines, individually but also as a group. Mayne I'll go check out some newer dance videos. Anyways, good video, just keep it up and keep working at it. Try and not forget that you are dancing as a group, one unit. So definitely watch the flow between one another. And always remember your facial expressions. Just a little advice. Keep up the hard work guys!",0,2023-05-25T19:02:06Z

@Rachel-gc9cf,"So my 6yr old nephew came over last night and I was watching skz dance practice videos on my phone. He came over tapped on Maniac and demanded that I stream it to the TV so he could watch too. He started watching and he said in awe, ""omg they're all such good dancers!"" He was quiet for a little bit watching before he suddenly asked, ""ok where's the cute one at right now?!"" 😅 I paused the video, ""umm what?"" He said, ""you know the cute one... the one that sings like an angel!"" I replied, ""Oh you must mean Seungmin."" (He saw a video recently of Seungmin singing alone so that's how I knew.) I pointed him out and he said, ""Yeah that's cute one alright."" 🤷‍♀️ Welp I can't say I disagree so I didn't argue and we proceeded to watch a bunch of the dance practice videos. He's such a cute Baby Stay. Haha 😄",2,2023-02-12T01:16:46Z

На самом деле он большой молодец и видно как он сильно старается, но мне всё же немного обидно что так мало дают ему возможности показать себя. Я понимаю что ему дают мало партий в песнях из за его (шикарного как я считаю) голоса. Но всё же мне обидно💔

@h-playwithmyhart.4806,"Bang Chan. As I’ve frequently noted, I have been a K-Pop fan for almost a decade but I have never seen somebody like you in the musical field before. What you have been and are capable of, is absolutely untouchable and I’ve learned that there is nothing that can take the sincerity and passion out of your character. I will say, despite being a long-time fan of K-Pop, I didn’t become a Stay until the just a few years ago. I don’t know how I went so long without knowing or supporting Stray Kids sooner, but I am completely and utterly thrilled to be a Stay now. To this day I wouldn’t know about Stray Kids if it weren’t for the Stay. I heard so much conversation among the fans of Stray Kids about how fearless of a leader you were, and I became curious. Over the course of those few years, I have spent my free time, which I lately have a lot of, getting to know you and your members. It started with liking a few songs, but then Stay, who talk with so much praise about you and your members, convinced me to see what was lying beneath the meaning of your music. I began to watch Stray Kids content whenever and of whatever I could, and I gradually fell more in love with your performance and personality overall. I have come to know how passionate and dedicated you are and have always been to music and performing. Even before Stray Kids was officially formed and debuted, you had music in your heart and I can see that clearly every time that you go on stage with your members. Not only do you have a naturally beautiful voice evident of vocal capability and strength, but your dancing skills are rigid and flawless beyond words. Your presence on stage is nothing less than inspirational and you ground and center your members in a way that I’ve never seen before. You always bring everyone together and emit unity on and off the stage. Outside of your musical performances, however, I have gotten the pleasure of getting to know you and your personality. I don’t even really know where to start by how touched I am at the positive impact you have already made on this world despite still having so much more left to say. Before I became a Stay, I didn’t know much about what Stray Kids had gone through to get where they are now; and I didn’t know just how much you went through either. However, the loving Stay introduced me to how hard you worked individually to keep your members’ heads above water through the rigorous days of training, performing, and other events that swarmed you. I was, and still am absolutely mesmerized at what you have accomplished to make this group possible, and successful beyond its comprehension. Thanks to the Stay, I know that before Stray Kids even debuted, you formed an unbreakable and unique bond with each of the members as well as one together as a whole. You lift your members up with the emotional and motivational weight of all the words that you’ve ever said to them. To know that there would be no Stray Kids without you makes me love you in a manner that is simply indescribable. I know that I, your members, and the Stay have so much respect and admiration for you because of everything that you’ve done and overcome in just the beginning of your musical journey. I have gotten the honor of seeing at least some of the group’s history and how it came to be, and seeing how you were a huge part of that makes me appreciate having you in my life more than I did before. You have single-handedly helped carry this group to victory and done so much to ensure that you stay together. You have always kept your promise that you, in words that I once heard you say, “Don’t leave anybody behind.” On top of leading your group to all of its success and glory, your are also humble and kind and always put them first. You sacrifice so much for your music, your members, and Stay and we recognize how hard you work day in and day out. You are so funny, clever, and know not to take life too seriously. At the same time you are professional, intelligent, respectful, and wise beyond your years. You are every bit qualified to be the leader that you are and I hope you never doubt your capability of doing that because Stay have seen you build something beautiful with your own two hands from the ground up. You never gave up even when the world encouraged you to and from that I find so much inspiration that I don’t even know how how to thank you. All I do know is that your family and parents are the most proud of you and love you more than any of us do. I can’t even imagine how strong they think you are for what you’ve created. I don’t want to put any more pressure or a burden on you, but so much would crash and burn without you and I hope that our love and support is enough to lift you up through your darkest times. You deserve so many blessings and praise. I just hope that you know your efforts are being recognized every second and that Stay, your members, and your family love you beyond words. I can’t thank you enough for everything that you’ve already done. You make Stay and your members feel so valued and desired and I know that only you can do that. I can’t wait to see what you do next because I know that I couldn’t leave you or stop supporting you if I tried. On behalf of your friends, Stay, members, and most importantly family, I pray that this birthday is filled with all of those blessings that you deserve and that it’s everything that you desire. I pray that you and your loved ones remain in good good health and good faith, because the world is relying on it in order to fully heal and love each other. Happy birthday Bang Chan, and from the bottom of my heart, we absolutely adore you!! You make Stray Kids all around the world stay!!",68,2022-10-03T06:00:47Z

@h-playwithmyhart.4806,"Felix. You have to be one of the biggest blessings on this Earth. I know that I crossed paths with Stray Kids for a reason, and I know you were one of those reasons. Before I even knew anything about Stray Kids, I knew about you. Three years ago, when I got my introduction to K-Pop and was beginning to like quite a few groups, I didn’t know much about Stray Kids, but I did know about you. I couldn’t go anywhere without hearing anybody talk about you, and that was what lead me into wanting to find out more about you, and your position in Stray Kids. I came into the fandom blindly, without knowing any of the names of the members, and relied on the Stay to tell me everything I needed to know about you. It was because of the intense loving fanbase that you have that I learned, in only a matter of days, what a rare talent you are. The depth of your voice combined with your passionate vocals is one of the most beautiful sounds I have ever heard. Your rapping and singing abilities are entirely specific to you and are so captivatingly intriguing, that I knew I loved you from the moment I first got introduced to you. You are so flexible with your voice and on the stage; and once I first got notice of how outstanding you are, I couldn’t stop discovering what made you so enticing and lovable. You are so recognized and appreciated for your natural talent that word reached me about how special you are before I even got a chance to know who Stray Kids really were. Since then, I have been a Stay, and I can say that you are an individual that led me to become one. I have never seen someone with such a bright presence and spirit completely dominant on stage and create an environment so mysterious and energetic for so many people. You bring to music what nobody else can, and I am so happy you share that with all of your Stay when you could be doing something else. I see how happy that you make your members, and since I am a relatively new fan, I still have yet to learn everything that Stray Kids has been through in the years that you’ve been active. However, I have already seen how much you have healed your members when they needed you the most and provided for Stay a support system that they can actually believe in. You are such a delight to be around and I get so happy just seeing your face these days, especially with all of the craziness that’s in the world. You have a strong-willed heart, and you are extremely kind, forgiving, and non-judgmental. I have loved becoming so acquainted with you and appreciating all of your hard work because you deserve it! You do so much for everyone, and I hope you know that you are so loved and Stay are so grateful to you for even the little things that you do every single day! Never give up and I hope you continue to be the person that uplifts Stay and your members! I know that no matter what happens, Stay will always support you and I can’t tell you how much you really mean to all of us. Thank you so much for being such a kind and loving human being, and for accepting me and so many people into your family as Stay! I pray that you and your loved ones stay safe, and find happiness and worth in the future! On behalf of your friends, members, Stay, and most importantly, your family, I want to wish you the most entertaining and enjoyable birthday ever!! Felix, have fun, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, stay safe, Happy, Birthday, and WE LOVE YOU!!!!",1,2022-09-15T07:25:16Z

@h-playwithmyhart.4806,"Jisung. Deciding to support Stray Kids has been one of the best decisions of my entire life, and you are one of the people who are the reason why I do so. I only just started supporting K-Pop groups three years ago, and I discovered so many groups because I had the time on my hands. However, since I graduated high school I have found I have been a lot busier and unfortunately haven’t been able to dedicate my time to supporting these groups that I like. I didn’t think that there was going to be any time left for me to support another group, but then you came along. My first experience from Stray Kids was the song ‘Side Effects,’ and it fortunately was a song where I got to hear the vocal and rap blend of your versatile voice. Next, it was ‘Boxer,’ which despite it being an upbeat song, almost moved to to tears because of how beautiful your voice sounded.  After that, I watched you on ‘The Masked Singer,’ and I couldn’t stop from there. I quickly learned that there is nothing that you can’t do. You are a stunning vocalist, flexible rapper, and outstanding dancer. Overall, this allows for you to be one of the most exceptional performers that I, and other Stay, have ever come to know. I knew, right from the moment that I heard your voice, that I had to have more. I kept going, and since then, I have come to learn so much about you and the legacy that you have already left on music. Stay is one of the most unique fandoms that I have been so fortunate to join, and I now know that you are one of the reasons why. I had always thought about Stray Kids as being such an active group and constantly releasing music and content to show how much Stay meant to them, only to find out that you have been such a huge part of that all along. I haven’t even been a Stay for very long yet, but I already have seen the indescribable impact that you left on Stay. It is unlike anything that I have ever seen. I can see how happy, inspired, and desperate that Stay are to reciprocate every ounce of love that you give to them. When I became aware of this, I knew I had to be a part of it. You are so generous, honest, loyal, and possibly most importantly, I have seen you completely change the type of day someone is having just by setting the mood. Whether it be your members, or Stay, you always make sure that everyone is having the best day possible, even it means you have to sacrifice your mood for somebody else. Because you are just naturally funny and inclined to make everybody around you happy, you have an outlook on life that causes everybody you ever meet to be better and happier because of it all. As I’ve said, I haven’t been a Stay for long at all, but on behalf of the other fans, I already can’t even thank you enough for everything that you do every day. You have such a refreshing personality that we all need, especially at this time in the world. I hope that you never lose the innate kindness in your heart and actions; and I am so blessed to be able to thank you for all of it today. On behalf of Stay, who encouraged me to join them and showed me that there are no limits to your love, your members, who adore you quite possibly in a way that no other person can, and your friends and family, who we know are so proud of you, I want to wish you the happiest birthday ever Jisung! I pray that you and your l loved ones stay safe and find happiness and worth in the future. I am so proud of everything that you have accomplished and am so glad I get to see you grow each day now!! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE stay safe, and I hope you know how much we all absolutely love you so much! Be happy!!!",2,2022-09-14T05:52:28Z

@h-playwithmyhart.4806,"Seungmin, I would like to wish you an early happy birthday, as the time is drawing close. My introduction to Stray Kids was unique in that the reason I decided to support it was because of the fans. I have been a K-Pop fan for almost a decade, and I have come to support many groups. However, becoming a Stay was a new experience for me because it was the first time that I joined a group because the love from the fans was so strong, I knew I needed to be a part of it. I learned about each Stray Kids member one at a time, and what I learned and admired very quickly about you was your individuality. Every member stands out for their own reasons, but your charm is retaining your individuality and independence while still being a part of something bigger. I became an official Stay two years ago, and since then I have gotten to see how well you blend in with your members. You are such a valued member of Stray Kids, that we can’t see them existing without you. You’ve also created a journey of personal growth and development both musically and personally and I have felt so connected to you since I’ve become a Stay. Your personality is so enticing in that sometimes you can be quiet and shy, but other times you are very vocal and humorous with your members. It’s very powerful that you can be so sweet and naturally kind-hearted without saying any words sometimes, while other times, being open and direct about how you feel. I can see how much your loving personality has impacted your members, because I’ve never seen them happier than when you spend time with them. You are always making your members laugh and motivating them just by putting one smile on their face. I feel so inspired watching you build such a trustworthy relationship with them and want to be at least half as generous as you. I know that your members are so thankful for you everyday and couldn’t be anywhere near as successful without you. I have never heard a fanbase talk so highly and frequently of a member in the way that they honor you. I always hear Stay talking about how gentle and sweet you are; and how much positivity and love you bring to the world wherever you go. Stay talk about your rare, emotion-based, and versatile voice that captivates everyone into your performance. They talk about the flawless and effortless dancing that you work so hard to share with us and spoil us with on every stage. They talk about your overall professional and inspirational performance on stage that leaves every Stay wanting to spend more time with you. I’ve heard so much about how beloved you are Seungmin, and once I became a Stay, I am seeing for myself how much you are adored all over the world. Not only by Stay, but the loving influence that you have on your members makes them and everyone that you meet a kinder and more loving person. Stay praise and speak so highly of you, that I can’t say I’ve experienced a family this loving toward an idol. I just want you know how much love there is everywhere all around the world for you. You are the reason that so many people lift their heads up and keep going another day, including me. There is so much negativity going on in the world right now, and to have you as a role model and see it not preventing you from sharing more love is making the world even stronger and closer to restoring to its greatness. I really feel like we don’t deserve you sometimes because your genuine strong heart is hard to come across these days. I hope that we can repay you even a little bit of the love you’ve shown us in just a few years since your debut. I know you have worked so hard to be where you are and I don’t even want to pretend to know how much you’ve probably gone through. I just want to take this day, and every day afterwards to recognize and let you become aware of how much I, Stay, and your members really love you. I know that your parents and the rest of your family are prouder of you than any other person and they respond to every action you take with great respect, understanding, and love. Your members and family are so lucky to have you and I know that are thankful and appreciative of you every day. Thank you so much for sacrificing more than we know just to make us happy even a little bit. On behalf of your friends, members, Stay, and loving family, I hope that the love that you have given to this world is given back to you on this special day and every day in your future. Please surround yourself by the people that love you most, and let the love that we have for you give you the most fulfillment! I wish you nothing but happiness for you and your loved ones, and I pray that you all stay safe!! Happy birthday Seungmin!! We adore you so much and we are so grateful to have such a bright light in our lives!!!",0,2022-09-06T03:14:39Z

@h-playwithmyhart.4806,"Changbin. I’m so fortunate to be able to celebrate your birthday with the rest of Stays. I would like to talk about your musicality. I’ve never heard anybody rap like you, and I know I won’t hear anybody rap like you for the rest of my life. You have this growl, this grit, that is enough to supply every word you say with the perfect amount of power and character that it needs. No matter what the circumstance is for your song, you retain this originality and this sound that nobody else has. The connection between the raps you create and your execution of them is simply seamless.  Your lyrical style is mesmerizing, and watching these musical ideas pop into your head like second nature is truly astonishing. You can also sing beautifully as well, and the rough texture of your voice gives you this edge that lights up all of your lines. It is rare to see somebody be able to master both singing and rapping, and the unique sound of your voice allows for you to become limitless through both. You are also an incredibly skilled dancer. Your moves are so natural, and watching you feels surreal because you become so immersed in your movement. You absorb all of these choreographies, and then interpret them in such a realistic and emotional way. You have so much power and when you dance, yet you have the right amount of control to give off just the perfect amount of expression. You give care to each little gesture, and treat each move with such delicacy. It is a journey from start to finish when you dance, and you take all of us with you without missing a single detail along the way. Overall, you are one among other artists that sincerely represent our generation and capture its essence. Your innovation and relationship with music are so complex and clear at the same time. You are young, but as you become older and more experienced, there is no telling what you’re already curious and inventive mind will supply to the world. Your impact on music and your Stay will be timeless. At the same time that I love your musicality, I love your personality as well. I first noticed that you are so laid-back and have this calming demeanor. You are also unexpectedly hilarious. You make jokes in moments where nobody anticipates and you can change the entire mood of a situation in mere seconds. You are so humble, and place those around you before you no matter what the circumstances. Though I have never met you in person, you have to be one of the best people to be around and I know that your members know this better than anybody else. You really hold your team down, and together, and always find a way to make sure everybody feels included. It has only been a short time since I’ve known you, but I saw almost instantly how your members individually love and cherish you in their own special way. You bring the excitement and thrill of life to them wherever and whenever they need it. You have the biggest heart. You have stood your members up time and time again and pointed them in the right direction if ever they forget what they are chasing after. You are somebody they can lean on through all instances in their life; and have become their brother. We all know that you provide your members with a love that they could not get from anybody else. Though they are all different, you find a way to embrace this and form a sacred relationship with each of them. I know that they will continue to grow and develop, but only with you by their side to guide them through it all. They will continue to be the best versions of themselves and there is nothing that can hold them back because you believe in them with all of your heart and soul. Your love will always trail them and aid them for the rest of their lives. Thank you for raising them, and changing their lives forever so that they can lead the fullest life possible. I want to personally thank your family and parents for raising you and helping you become the aspiring young man you are today. I know how much your family means to you, and you have firsthand showed us what they mean to you and how you spend your time with them. It is clear to see that you already keep this in mind with you at all times, but I just want to say that I hope you can always rely on them in your life when you find you need somebody. When you find yourself having troubles down the line, I hope you can remember the feeling of being with them to restore you to your former state of peace and optimism. Your family loves you more than anybody else on this planet, and I hope you know that when you feel there is nobody who can understand, they will always be there to help you out of any tough situation. They are the most proud of you, will always be the most proud of you, and you honor them with every step you take towards your dream. As Stay, we keep them in our hearts as you do and hope to become as dedicated and authentic through all that we do as they are. Changbin, it is often said that Stay are the luckiest fandom in the world, and I can wholeheartedly agree with that as you are responsible for the truth behind this. You are extremely sensitive and considerate of all of our feelings, and that is perhaps one of the aspects of you that I love the most. You seem to always listen to what we have to say and are even eager to respond to it. When discussing Stay with your members or others, you always have the most original ideas and show us how much you love us through your own eyes. When we chose to become a Stay, you chose us. Your world opened up to us and you invited us to become every bit of a part of you as your members and family.  Similarly to your members, there are Stay from all over the world who come from different backgrounds, and it is only because of you that we are able to come together in unity. I know it’s not always easy to let us in and to see us while you’re in a tough situation, but the fact that you put your fears aside and show up for us every time is the greatest testament of your love for us. You are the first person we turn to when we are down and need cheering up. It is truly the greatest honor getting to be the ones that you work so hard for and trust it all to. You have faith in us when we don’t, and it gives us enough confidence to tackle whatever is thrown at us. Thank you for loving us unconditionally, and being there when nobody else has. Thank you for changing our lives, and being at the heart of the greatest days of our lives. I know that you’ve been through a lot, and you’ve only been active with Stray kids for a few mere years. I’ve seen firsthand how it took all you had and then some to even debut, and there have been too many struggles since then that you’ve faced. The best that I can do, knowing that you’ve been in these difficult situations more than anybody should be in, is try to imagine how it feels to be in your shoes. I know that it’s been a lot. All that I can say, on behalf of all of your loved ones, that we are so proud of you for making it past all of these moments. You have a heart a gold and always keep your head up even when it feels impossible, and I know that this is the reason why you’ve been able to persevere through all that you’ve been through. Thank you for teaching us that we can do the same, and for having enough ability to force a fulfilled live for your Stay and members a well. We know that you can take charge and make it out of whatever happens in the future. I hope that this birthday makes all of your dreams come true and that you accmplish all that you desire on this special day. I often wonder of when you get to take a break and truly look back on the impact that you’ve had on the world, so I hope that if anything, your special day provides you for the perfect opportunity to do that. I hope you are able to look at the countless hearts that you touch every day around the world in limitless ways, and let that make you feel as loved and honored as you’ve ever felt. I hope that those around you also help you to see how worthy of love and commemoration that you truly are. Please relax today and I hope that you spend every second making precious memories. I hope that this day goes down as one of the greatest you’ve had in a while. You deserve all of the sucess and blessings, and I know that more will only come to you. Thank you for sacrificing so much just to make Stray Kids and several other projects possible. Thank you for suffering through any pain, concern, fear, doubt, isolation, confusion, fatigue, stress, and so much more just to bring us any content at all. I hope that you never feel pressured or obligated to change because you are a rare gem of a human being. The world, and more specifically, your Stay need you just as you are to continue to inspire us and remind us what it is to love others and yourself in daily life. You are beautiful inside and out, and perfect as you are. I hope you remember we always will support you no matter what! I pray that you and your loved ones stay safe, and find happiness and worth in the future! Happy birthday Changbin, and we adore you so much!!!!!!!!",1,2022-08-10T07:14:11Z

Let's go
Relax everyone, stop pretending to be normal
All of your smiles look weird
When the Lock is released, we're all the same
Your eyes can't fool me, ho

The real self has been released
Barely holding on
After blinking once, back
Again, back to cosplaying as what
Society defines normal to be ppow

Mash up, mind blown put my mind on back up
Prototype, on the inside I'm always a freaky monster
Kindness is no longer trending, now rotten
You can backbite me as much as you want
I'll ignore them anyway

Like the seam of a torn doll
Eventually, you'll expose your real self
In this not easy life
It ain't ""live"" it's ""holding on"" yeah

Relax everyone, stop pretending to be normal
All of your smiles no fresh
When the Locket is open, we're all the same
Your eyes can't fool me, ho

This street I'm walking on is a minefield
Like a dormant volcano, never know when it'll all explode
Never know when the calm winds will change
Everyone lives hiding themselves like a sealed tornado

This man is truly iconic, as someone who's familiar with kpop since 2nd gen, I've never seen anyone like Hyunjin
It's not only about being best in this team, he's one of the best of all Kpop.

@staaaaaaaaa5098,"All of them but especially Lee Know nailed in this choreography. It can be the most creative choreo i’ve ever seen in kpop. And the fact that their synchronization on chorus was incredibly good. They way they’ve changed so quick and their movements being so smooth on the part when minho, jeoning and seungmin were leaving and han was coming to the center for his rap among with chan appearing from his back really catches my eyes. This is why jype artist are the best when it comes to dancing. And i have to appreciate Felix as well. As someone who has been diagnosed with same back injury as him years ago, watching him dancing on chorus gave me back pain once again. What he is doing is seriously not easy, i can confirm it. Skz keep developing themselves like all members dance like they are a part of the dance line of the group.",184,2022-04-03T15:45:26Z

Odanda onların posterleri bile vardı, kavgamızda o posterlerini yırttığım için tekrardan özür dilerim. Seninle beraber gülüşümüzü, kavga edişimizi, alışveriş yapışımızı çok özledim. Hâlâda özlüyorum. Odan sessizlik dolu, her girdiğimde nasıl bıraktıysan öyle duruyor. Temizlik yaparken günlüğünü karıştırmıştım. ""Jisung, lütfen yardım et. Dayanamıyorum artık, neden ben bunları yaşıyorum? Okulda zorbalıl görmekten bıktım.."" yazıyordu. Neden bana söylemedi ve onun varlığından bile haberdar olmayan birine yazdı diye düşündüm. Sinirlendim sen okuldan geldiğin zaman posterlerini yırtık bir şekilde gördün. Ağladın, çok ağladın. Pişman olmuştum, gerçekten pişman oldum. Eğer bunu tekrar yaşasam yapmazdım canım kızım, sana yaşattığım her anı için özür dilerim. Her mezarına geldiğimde beraber günlüğüne Stray Kids ile alakalı şeyler yazıyoruz. Beraber yazdığımızı çok güzel hissediyorum. Sanki kalemimi benimle tutuyormuşsun gibi, ""Elif ve Eflin sana kırmızı güller bırakıyor mu? Yada sevdiğin çocuklardan sana poster gibi şeyler getiriyorlar mı?"" mezarına bakıp konuştuğumda, minik bir rüzgar esti. Senin işaretin diye düşündüm tatlı kızım, öyle düşünmek istedim.

IN now is fabulous and a real pro. His cutiness still makes me smile but swag is also here. 
It is so cool to see how Han enjoys this song and sings along. He's wonderful.
Seungmin improved his skills in everything. How his heartbreaking voice could become more touching? His dances are always stunning.
Lee Know's moves are smooth, he is an example of elegance. He did great job.

@deisbxn,"Wanna learn the choreo? Unfortunately, Felix isn’t in the choreo v much (speedy recovery Lixie!) so in exchange, watch Seungmin! He’s a vocalist but his dancing skills actually has a good definition to it that is easy to follow. He’s able to sustain his energy the best. 

Wanna increase your stage presence? Watch Hyunjin—he likes his Maniac choreo snappy and aggressive. He also has good body proportions and sharp angles and the best silhouette in the team, so his dancing style focuses on emphasizing his traits. However, he doesn’t overdance—if anything, he peaks his energy on the parts that matter. 

Wanna do the hiprolls? Watch Lee Know and Changbin—I think Lee Know did it closest to the actual choreo while Changbin had the best energy and hip control/fluidity. 

Wanna perform it? Oh well, watch Lee Know and Han! Han has one of the best facial expressions in the team and Lee Know has the most precise movement appropriate to the choreo and the vibe.

@jgbooks3283,"Stray Kids are so very special! They excel individually and as a team. The positive vibe they exude is real. I don't know what accounts for it, but probably a combo of Chan's selfless leadership and skill at picking perfectly matched members, their choreography and lyrics which evenly distribute time and spotlight on all the members, and all of them being such very nice people that comes across so strongly. They are always caring, kind, driven to improve, grateful, and humble. Their humor and playfulness is a joy.

@RM_formerlyjustRMbutYTsucks,"-I.N slowly adopting the crop top agenda.

- I love how well they blend. They're all, at minimum, good dancers, but the group as a whole always looks so great when they dance because the ones with a higher level tend to work to match with the others, which keeps members from standing out when they shouldn't and makes the entire group look better than if you have one person showing off. _Not_ standing out/drawing attention when you shouldn't is an actual skill, one that's very undervalued by the general public.

- Go _off,_ I.N! Boy went all in on this! His vocals and dance have both shown so much growth this last year.

- That is the best view we've gotten so far of the volcano ripple. It looks so GOOD here! I wish the camera work on the stages was showing it better.

- The second drill chorus is a ripple! It's so closely timed, and there's usually so much else going on, that I hadn't caught that before. But it's a ripple on sixteenth notes. SIXTEENTH notes. They divided one beat into a perfect four-part ripple. Wtf.

- 😥watching Felix over in the doorway dancing along with his hands.

- Seo Changbin, sir. We see you doing the ""popping"" thrusts in the same choreographed form as everyone else. Which means your evolution into dropping your arm back behind your a$$ so you can _really_ pop that pelvis in performances is 100% deliberate. There's a Lee Know soundclip out there full of utter BS about ""It's part of the choreo"" that I am now also applying to you.",195,2022-04-02T19:36:34Z

If it's just because they want to leave him out they cannot do that! Felix and any other member should be included in the choreography(and a choreography in general!)! He is like the glue for this song because he also sings most of the main parts. You can even see him doing little movements with the members when he's not included like he wants to be, I may be mistaken but it's still not fair!

@matterofperspective101,"Hyunjin and Lee Know proving both are THE dancers!!! They ate the choreography. Felix did an amazing job too, his stage presence is so strong he doesn't even need to be there all the time, intro and his center time was perfect, he's stan attractor for a reason, get well soon , our sunshine!Jisung and IN?! they killing it this comeback!!! Both shining so bright 
Seungmin improved his dance skills A LOT, I noticed it, all doing an amazing job. Channie has on of the strongest stage presences in SKZ, he's underestimated as dancer, imho he doesn't miss a single beat. Binnie, sir, hip thrusts profi?! Truly 8 all rounders
Overall Hyunjin is still my favorite in terms of dance, not only in SKZ, but generally, because he's simply beyond perfection in every aspect from execution to expressiveness. He's flawless. 
But please appreciate all 8!!! They all working hard and SKZ choreographies are easily one of the best in whole industry if not THE best. I wish company and choreographer gives them less tiring/fatiguing and hard choreographies in the future, my heart breaks when they got injured, their health should be priority!! There're so many options how make easy but still eye catching chore. Our 8 boys are our priority and their health!!! 
Thanks for always working so hard, we see everything, WE LOVE YOU ❣️
It's biggest flex to stan such a group like SKZ, being loved as fan and being mind blown each comeback how they outdo themselves.",28,2022-04-02T14:54:15Z

@Soobinsoobinyouknow,I am so proud of these boys. They are so talented and have a long way ahead. This is gonna be their world domination. It hurts to see Lix not dancing much. I really hope he gets well soon. The rest of the members should rest alot too as it hasn't been a long time since they recovered from Covid. Stanning them was one of the best things I have done. Stanning kpop is the only reason I am proud of myself. I will always be by them till the day I die. ❤️❤️❤️❤️,1,2022-04-02T14:38:00Z

Just give them break from this hard choreographies... I hope next comeback company reflects it !!!

His versatility is impressive 
Kpop Performance Leader by k media 
""THE Hwang Hyunjin, role model dancer "" by Changbin
""The best male dancer"" by dance YT channel Studio Choom
Ranked as #4 among ALL kpop dancers by ARATA Dance School
We recently watched how he monitors that members are in sync (Channie said it too!) 
Should I continue? With non fanmade titles this man got?
We're supporting you till very last step out, just know it, you're superior!!!!

@n.a9855,They're perfectly in sync & amazing. SKZ is the best at creating something fresh. I just love how Hyunjin controls his energy though. The way he slowed it down & back being aggressive at just the right moment. Even his ponytail is dancing to the beat. I'm really impressed by how much he has developed his own identity in dancing in just a short amount of time. Every movement is precise & clean. I'm really happy he's in SKZ..a match made in heaven..all of them.,27,2022-04-02T11:39:21Z

@kellykuk,"I absolutely adore watching the dance practices! We get to see the raw dance routine before any necessary tweeks are made. We get to see the Kids in 'working mode' and you can ALMOST hear them thinking, ""I've gotta put the foot there! I've gotta land here!"" 

The MANIAC dance routine has become a personal favourite of mine. I just love how disconnected and disjointed it is, just like the song so it goes incredibly well.

One thing that I also like is the fact that it's clearly been designed with Felixs back injury in mind but in such a way that he can still participate, however limited it may be. It also looks easy to adapt if and when Felix has been given the 'all clear' by his doctor and/or his physiotherapist. 

Thank you for giving us STAY this generous gift. We appreciate it so much. Keep up this amazing work. We love you so much. 

Kindest regards,

Чану безумно идут голубые волосы, как и Минхо фиолетовые, поблагодарим же их парикмахеров. Чонин, Чанбин и Джисон в этом камбэке открываются с новой стороны для меня, я все чаще пересматриваю кусочки с ними в центре. Сынмин сияет.
