@LassyAndy-c4e,"Please spread this message:

STAYs. I hate this. I hate who we are. No. Who we've become. 
Listen to ""#LoveSTAY"", please. See how much they loved us. Maybe they still do, but honestly, you know what? I'm not sure if we even deserve it.

Do we love them? Sure. But our love honestly was corrupted. We became toxic, focused on looks, became stalkers and you know whats the worst? We dissapoint them. 
Remember Chan's first picture where he looked sad? A ""fan"" calling Linos number? People bullying them 24/7 on when they tryna get a flight? STAYs following them everywhere and invading there damn personal space? 
I HATE that Channie had to apolofise for being ""over dramatic"". Like, we did something wrong, it was never him. 
And of course I was sad when he removed his pic and info on bubble, but we kinda deserved it.

I always see people commenting how wrong this is and that true STAYS wouldn't do this. 
Okay. Okay I know, but tell that StrayKids. Say it to THEM. Because they need it. 
They need us the most right now. Because if they fall into depression etc. in the end, well, we are at fault.
The fans toxicity killed so many idols already, haven't we learned one bit? 
#Moondbin as an example. 
We should be Straykids's safe place.

Go on bubble or anywhere, Insta, Facebook, Youtube and more and tell them. Tell them. 
Just... be there for them. Just because they smile, doesn't mean they're happy. 
Just because they act joyful doesn't mean they're empty and hurting. 
Just because they still say they love STAYs, doesn't mean we made them cry.

Please share

@h-playwithmyhart.4806,"Hyunjin. It was certainly your musicality that drew me to you first. You have such a playful but easy tone which highlights and gives definition to every Stray Kids song. You don’t have fixated or set rapping style. You are very experimental vocally and lyrically and I’ve found myself charmed by your voice due to the versatility of it. I also love your singing style for similar reasons. You are just as diverse of a singer as you are rapper. It is really peaceful and harmonious; and blends perfectly with the rest of your members. I love how you don’t hold anything back when you’re singing and I can really feel the emotion and work that you pour into each line that you sing. Similarly to your singing and rapping, your body knows no limits when you are met with a choreography. You dance with a ferocity and a passion that no other performers can possess. You take each choreography and sincerely make it your own, which is honestly a blessing to watch. When you are dancing, you can be yourself and express your emotions with the beauty of your body movements. You can lose yourself easily into your dance and you are so comfortable and trusting of your own abilities. For this generation specifically, you have transformed music and given new meaning to what it can and should do for people. You are changing the world each day that you continue to share your artistry and dance; and we are so lucky to be alive right now to get to be a part of the history that you’re making. At the same time that I love your music and dance, I love your personality as well. I love that sometimes you keep to yourself, but other times, you are goofy and outgoing. As I mentioned before, you are extremely freeing to be around and those who spend time with you can relax and be themselves in your presence. I know that nobody can attest to these qualities quite like your members. Seven different personalities, and they all love you and cherish you for their own special reasons. They’ve looked to you and have modeled their perseverance off of how you strive to not let the difficult times hold you down and prevent you from success. You have opened your heart up to all seven people, although you come from different backgrounds, and that has encouraged them to all to have such a loving relationship with one another. You’ve had love for them since you began your journey with them and this has establishing a lifelong love that all of you had before you even debuted. You see the beauty and necessity of every single member and constantly remind them how important they are to Stray Kids. There is likely no greater feeling for them than knowing that they have you by their side if they don’t have anything else. The most important takeaway is the time they spend with you and the way you make them feel, and these are both filled with warm memories they can take with them for the rest of their lives. You’ve already spent some of the happiest and life-changing moments of your life with them, and there is still more to come. The members of Stray Kids, also your brothers and your family, couldn’t have somebody who loves them any more than you do to look after them. You are always so considerate of them and their feelings and respond to them however they need. They are the best versions of themselves because of you and because you love them just the way they are. Now, they can go on to do whatever they aspire to because you’ve encouraged them with that confidence. I want to personally thank your parents and family for raising you and helping you become the person you are today. I know they mean a lot to you, and that you couldn’t be here doing what you are without their love and support. Because of them, you can use your platform to share with the world the same love that they have provided you with your whole life. I hope you never forget that they are always going to be the most proud of you no matter what you do. They love you most in this world and they do so in a way that nobody else understands. Stay love them as you do and we keep them in our hearts as we continue our time with you. We are so grateful to them for bringing you into the world, and for changing the world the same way that you do. Hyunjin, you touch each individual heart of every Stay, and this is easily one of the most charming parts about you. It is in your nature to make each and every Stay feel special, even if you don’t know us personally. You welcome Stay from all around the world with open arms, and I felt as if I was a part of the family my whole life. You are so dedicated to your Stay and this is very apparent in everything that you do, whether it be performing or communicating with us directly. You have so much compassion for Stay and I feel like we are existing in our own separate world with you. Although we all live in different areas across the world, you take us to a place where we can all be one big family together, and it is one of the greatest feelings in the world. What you give to us is irreplaceable, and there could never be another person who helps us see the worth in ourselves the way you do. You also help us love one another. You influence others to treat others with kindness and I’ve met some of the most heartwarming Stay. I know that you help this family become closer every single day, and you remind us that if we have nothing else, we have each other. You invite us into your heart, the same way that you do your members, and you see qualities in us that we don’t even see ourselves. I know for a fact that there are Stay who only believe in themselves because of you. You also share so much of yourself with us, and this is perhaps one of the biggest ways you can show somebody that you trust. As time goes on, I notice you revealing more of yourself through your music and just through direct conversation with your Stay. You have gotten so personal with us and this lets us know just how much you actually believe in us and trust us to keep these parts of you within our hearts. There is no greater honor than to have you place this vulnerable side of you in our hands, and we want to do the same for you. I know that it is not always easy to do this, so I hope you know that we could never mislead you or betray your trust if we wanted to. You are one of the most generous people we know, and we could not be here giving love to others and to you without the love that you gave us first. I know that you’ve been through a lot, both personally, and professionally, and that your time as an idol has not always been easy or enjoyable. You have been active for some years now, but during your training period alone, you’ve been met with demanding expectations, which many people cannot even say they’ve undergone. Just as your family is, Stay could not be more proud of you from overcoming your hardships and making it out on the brighter side. Each time you are met with a grueling time or task, thought it make time, you eventually endure through it until the end, and become more experienced. As Stay, I can say we learn so much from how you choose to release stress or convey how you’re feeling through the mediums that provide you comfort.  We are beyond proud of you and continue to learn from you each day. I hope that this birthday makes all of your dreams come true, and you can take the time to truly celebrate who you are as a person. I know it might be difficult to focus on yourself, and if you find this to be the case, I hope you leave it to those who surround you and your admiring fans from all across the world to help you realize how revolutionary of a person you are. You are truly a gifted musician, and a courteous and selfless individual. You deserve this day, and every day that follows, to feel as appreciated as you truly are. I hope that every second is filled with memories that are unforgettable, and that this will be one of the greatest days that you’ve had! Please have fun and celebrate in whatever way you choose, because your Stay will be cheering with you! Thank you for sacrificing your time, efforts, pain, doubt, fear, tears, emotions, and physical boundaries just to bring us any content at all. For every effort that you put in that you might think is small, a Stay’s mood or day is completely changed for the better. You are blessing to this world and continue to change it every day with how you choose to heal it and the people living in it. I hope you don’t overwork yourself because you are perfect just the way you present yourself to us. We will support you and be there for you for the rest of our lives! I pray that you and your loved ones stay safe, and find happiness and worth in the future. Happy birthday Hyunjin, and we adore you so much!",2,2025-03-20T07:19:44Z

@KimberlyDayah,"This performance video is one I watch very frequently as this song has become one of the top songs on repeat these days and watch it in my head when listening. But I will always enjoy the memory of 0:44 in the street version (https://youtu.be/1Un3wEJFu7A?si=z3aiqN3cZLjRfxH9) every time! Headbutting at the bell is my favorite part! And Seungmin's cute jab at the other bell is close second favorite moment (2:00 street version). But the choreo, particularly the members' **personality in the choreo** (and Felix's kick 2:00 and I.N's part at 2:20), is why I love this video!",0,2024-02-26T18:43:20Z

@h-playwithmyhart.4806,"Bang Chan. As I’ve frequently noted, I have been a K-Pop fan for almost a decade but I have never seen somebody like you in the musical field before. What you have been and are capable of, is absolutely untouchable and I’ve learned that there is nothing that can take the sincerity and passion out of your character. I will say, despite being a long-time fan of K-Pop, I didn’t become a Stay until the just a few years ago. I don’t know how I went so long without knowing or supporting Stray Kids sooner, but I am completely and utterly thrilled to be a Stay now. To this day I wouldn’t know about Stray Kids if it weren’t for the Stay. I heard so much conversation among the fans of Stray Kids about how fearless of a leader you were, and I became curious. Over the course of those few years, I have spent my free time, which I lately have a lot of, getting to know you and your members. It started with liking a few songs, but then Stay, who talk with so much praise about you and your members, convinced me to see what was lying beneath the meaning of your music. I began to watch Stray Kids content whenever and of whatever I could, and I gradually fell more in love with your performance and personality overall. I have come to know how passionate and dedicated you are and have always been to music and performing. Even before Stray Kids was officially formed and debuted, you had music in your heart and I can see that clearly every time that you go on stage with your members. Not only do you have a naturally beautiful voice evident of vocal capability and strength, but your dancing skills are rigid and flawless beyond words. Your presence on stage is nothing less than inspirational and you ground and center your members in a way that I’ve never seen before. You always bring everyone together and emit unity on and off the stage. Outside of your musical performances, however, I have gotten the pleasure of getting to know you and your personality. I don’t even really know where to start by how touched I am at the positive impact you have already made on this world despite still having so much more left to say. Before I became a Stay, I didn’t know much about what Stray Kids had gone through to get where they are now; and I didn’t know just how much you went through either. However, the loving Stay introduced me to how hard you worked individually to keep your members’ heads above water through the rigorous days of training, performing, and other events that swarmed you. I was, and still am absolutely mesmerized at what you have accomplished to make this group possible, and successful beyond its comprehension. Thanks to the Stay, I know that before Stray Kids even debuted, you formed an unbreakable and unique bond with each of the members as well as one together as a whole. You lift your members up with the emotional and motivational weight of all the words that you’ve ever said to them. To know that there would be no Stray Kids without you makes me love you in a manner that is simply indescribable. I know that I, your members, and the Stay have so much respect and admiration for you because of everything that you’ve done and overcome in just the beginning of your musical journey. I have gotten the honor of seeing at least some of the group’s history and how it came to be, and seeing how you were a huge part of that makes me appreciate having you in my life more than I did before. You have single-handedly helped carry this group to victory and done so much to ensure that you stay together. You have always kept your promise that you, in words that I once heard you say, “Don’t leave anybody behind.” On top of leading your group to all of its success and glory, your are also humble and kind and always put them first. You sacrifice so much for your music, your members, and Stay and we recognize how hard you work day in and day out. You are so funny, clever, and know not to take life too seriously. At the same time you are professional, intelligent, respectful, and wise beyond your years. You are every bit qualified to be the leader that you are and I hope you never doubt your capability of doing that because Stay have seen you build something beautiful with your own two hands from the ground up. You never gave up even when the world encouraged you to and from that I find so much inspiration that I don’t even know how how to thank you. All I do know is that your family and parents are the most proud of you and love you more than any of us do. I can’t even imagine how strong they think you are for what you’ve created. I don’t want to put any more pressure or a burden on you, but so much would crash and burn without you and I hope that our love and support is enough to lift you up through your darkest times. You deserve so many blessings and praise. I just hope that you know your efforts are being recognized every second and that Stay, your members, and your family love you beyond words. I can’t thank you enough for everything that you’ve already done. You make Stay and your members feel so valued and desired and I know that only you can do that. I can’t wait to see what you do next because I know that I couldn’t leave you or stop supporting you if I tried. On behalf of your friends, Stay, members, and most importantly family, I pray that this birthday is filled with all of those blessings that you deserve and that it’s everything that you desire. I pray that you and your loved ones remain in good good health and good faith, because the world is relying on it in order to fully heal and love each other. Happy birthday Bang Chan, and from the bottom of my heart, we absolutely adore you. You make Stray Kids all around the world stay!",5,2022-09-30T05:46:55Z

@h-playwithmyhart.4806,"Felix. You have to be one of the biggest blessings on this Earth. I know that I crossed paths with Stray Kids for a reason, and I know you were one of those reasons. Before I even knew anything about Stray Kids, I knew about you. Three years ago, when I got my introduction to K-Pop and was beginning to like quite a few groups, I didn’t know much about Stray Kids, but I did know about you. I couldn’t go anywhere without hearing anybody talk about you, and that was what lead me into wanting to find out more about you, and your position in Stray Kids. I came into the fandom blindly, without knowing any of the names of the members, and relied on the Stay to tell me everything I needed to know about you. It was because of the intense loving fanbase that you have that I learned, in only a matter of days, what a rare talent you are. The depth of your voice combined with your passionate vocals is one of the most beautiful sounds I have ever heard. Your rapping and singing abilities are entirely specific to you and are so captivatingly intriguing, that I knew I loved you from the moment I first got introduced to you. You are so flexible with your voice and on the stage; and once I first got notice of how outstanding you are, I couldn’t stop discovering what made you so enticing and lovable. You are so recognized and appreciated for your natural talent that word reached me about how special you are before I even got a chance to know who Stray Kids really were. Since then, I have been a Stay, and I can say that you are an individual that led me to become one. I have never seen someone with such a bright presence and spirit completely dominant on stage and create an environment so mysterious and energetic for so many people. You bring to music what nobody else can, and I am so happy you share that with all of your Stay when you could be doing something else. I see how happy that you make your members, and since I am a relatively new fan, I still have yet to learn everything that Stray Kids has been through in the years that you’ve been active. However, I have already seen how much you have healed your members when they needed you the most and provided for Stay a support system that they can actually believe in. You are such a delight to be around and I get so happy just seeing your face these days, especially with all of the craziness that’s in the world. You have a strong-willed heart, and you are extremely kind, forgiving, and non-judgmental. I have loved becoming so acquainted with you and appreciating all of your hard work because you deserve it! You do so much for everyone, and I hope you know that you are so loved and Stay are so grateful to you for even the little things that you do every single day! Never give up and I hope you continue to be the person that uplifts Stay and your members! I know that no matter what happens, Stay will always support you and I can’t tell you how much you really mean to all of us. Thank you so much for being such a kind and loving human being, and for accepting me and so many people into your family as Stay! I pray that you and your loved ones stay safe, and find happiness and worth in the future. On behalf of your friends, members, Stay, and most importantly, your family, I want to wish you the most entertaining and enjoyable birthday ever! Felix, have fun, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, stay safe, Happy, Birthday, and WE LOVE YOU!!!",3,2022-09-14T00:53:23Z
@h-playwithmyhart.4806,"Jisung. Deciding to support Stray Kids has been one of the best decisions of my entire life, and you are one of the people who are the reason why I do so. I only just started supporting K-Pop groups three years ago, and I discovered so many groups because I had the time on my hands. However, since I graduated high school I have found I have been a lot busier and unfortunately haven’t been able to dedicate my time to supporting these groups that I like. I didn’t think that there was going to be any time left for me to support another group, but then you came along. My first experience from Stray Kids was the song ‘Side Effects,’ and it fortunately was a song where I got to hear the vocal and rap blend of your versatile voice. Next, it was ‘Boxer,’ which despite it being an upbeat song, almost moved to to tears because of how beautiful your voice sounded.  After that, I watched you on ‘The Masked Singer,’ and I couldn’t stop from there. I quickly learned that there is nothing that you can’t do. You are a stunning vocalist, flexible rapper, and outstanding dancer. Overall, this allows for you to be one of the most exceptional performers that I, and other Stay, have ever come to know. I knew, right from the moment that I heard your voice, that I had to have more. I kept going, and since then, I have come to learn so much about you and the legacy that you have already left on music. Stay is one of the most unique fandoms that I have been so fortunate to join, and I now know that you are one of the reasons why. I had always thought about Stray Kids as being such an active group and constantly releasing music and content to show how much Stay meant to them, only to find out that you have been such a huge part of that all along. I haven’t even been a Stay for very long yet, but I already have seen the indescribable impact that you left on Stay. It is unlike anything that I have ever seen. I can see how happy, inspired, and desperate that Stay are to reciprocate every ounce of love that you give to them. When I became aware of this, I knew I had to be a part of it. You are so generous, honest, loyal, and possibly most importantly, I have seen you completely change the type of day someone is having just by setting the mood. Whether it be your members, or Stay, you always make sure that everyone is having the best day possible, even it means you have to sacrifice your mood for somebody else. Because you are just naturally funny and inclined to make everybody around you happy, you have an outlook on life that causes everybody you ever meet to be better and happier because of it all. As I’ve said, I haven’t been a Stay for long at all, but on behalf of the other fans, I already can’t even thank you enough for everything that you do every day. You have such a refreshing personality that we all need, especially at this time in the world. I hope that you never lose the innate kindness in your heart and actions; and I am so blessed to be able to thank you for all of it today. On behalf of Stay, who encouraged me to join them and showed me that there are no limits to your love, your members, who adore you quite possibly in a way that no other person can, and your friends and family, who we know are so proud of you, I want to wish you the happiest birthday ever Jisung! I pray that you and your l loved ones stay safe and find happiness and worth in the future. I am so proud of everything that you have accomplished and am so glad I get to see you grow each day now! PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE stay safe, and I hope you know how much we all absolutely love you so much!!! Be happy!!",1,2022-09-12T22:07:22Z

@h-playwithmyhart.4806,"Seungmin, I would like to wish you an early happy birthday, as the time is drawing close. My introduction to Stray Kids was unique in that the reason I decided to support it was because of the fans. I have been a K-Pop fan for almost a decade, and I have come to support many groups. However, becoming a Stay was a new experience for me because it was the first time that I joined a group because the love from the fans was so strong, I knew I needed to be a part of it. I learned about each Stray Kids member one at a time, and what I learned and admired very quickly about you was your individuality. Every member stands out for their own reasons, but your charm is retaining your individuality and independence while still being a part of something bigger. I became an official Stay two years ago, and since then I have gotten to see how well you blend in with your members. You are such a valued member of Stray Kids, that we can’t see them existing without you. You’ve also created a journey of personal growth and development both musically and personally and I have felt so connected to you since I’ve become a Stay. Your personality is so enticing in that sometimes you can be quiet and shy, but other times you are very vocal and humorous with your members. It’s very powerful that you can be so sweet and naturally kind-hearted without saying any words sometimes, while other times, being open and direct about how you feel. I can see how much your loving personality has impacted your members, because I’ve never seen them happier than when you spend time with them. You are always making your members laugh and motivating them just by putting one smile on their face. I feel so inspired watching you build such a trustworthy relationship with them and want to be at least half as generous as you. I know that your members are so thankful for you everyday and couldn’t be anywhere near as successful without you. I have never heard a fanbase talk so highly and frequently of a member in the way that they honor you. I always hear Stay talking about how gentle and sweet you are; and how much positivity and love you bring to the world wherever you go. Stay talk about your rare, emotion-based, and versatile voice that captivates everyone into your performance. They talk about the flawless and effortless dancing that you work so hard to share with us and spoil us with on every stage. They talk about your overall professional and inspirational performance on stage that leaves every Stay wanting to spend more time with you. I’ve heard so much about how beloved you are Seungmin, and once I became a Stay, I am seeing for myself how much you are adored all over the world. Not only by Stay, but the loving influence that you have on your members makes them and everyone that you meet a kinder and more loving person. Stay praise and speak so highly of you, that I can’t say I’ve experienced a family this loving toward an idol. I just want you know how much love there is everywhere all around the world for you. You are the reason that so many people lift their heads up and keep going another day, including me. There is so much negativity going on in the world right now, and to have you as a role model and see it not preventing you from sharing more love is making the world even stronger and closer to restoring to its greatness. I really feel like we don’t deserve you sometimes because your genuine strong heart is hard to come across these days. I hope that we can repay you even a little bit of the love you’ve shown us in just a few years since your debut. I know you have worked so hard to be where you are and I don’t even want to pretend to know how much you’ve probably gone through. I just want to take this day, and every day afterwards to recognize and let you become aware of how much I, Stay, and your members really love you. I know that your parents and the rest of your family are prouder of you than any other person and they respond to every action you take with great respect, understanding, and love. Your members and family are so lucky to have you and I know that are thankful and appreciative of you every day. Thank you so much for sacrificing more than we know just to make us happy even a little bit. On behalf of your friends, members, Stay, and loving family, I hope that the love that you have given to this world is given back to you on this special day and every day in your future. Please surround yourself by the people that love you most, and let the love that we have for you give you the most fulfillment! I wish you nothing but happiness for you and your loved ones, and I pray that you all stay safe. Happy birthday Seungmin! We adore you so much and we are so grateful to have such a bright light in our lives!",2,2022-09-04T22:52:39Z

@h-playwithmyhart.4806,"Changbin. I’m so fortunate to be able to celebrate your birthday with the rest of Stays. I would like to talk about your musicality. I’ve never heard anybody rap like you, and I know I won’t hear anybody rap like you for the rest of my life. You have this growl, this grit, that is enough to supply every word you say with the perfect amount of power and character that it needs. No matter what the circumstance is for your song, you retain this originality and this sound that nobody else has. The connection between the raps you create and your execution of them is simply seamless.  Your lyrical style is mesmerizing, and watching these musical ideas pop into your head like second nature is truly astonishing. You can also sing beautifully as well, and the rough texture of your voice gives you this edge that lights up all of your lines. It is rare to see somebody be able to master both singing and rapping, and the unique sound of your voice allows for you to become limitless through both. You are also an incredibly skilled dancer. Your moves are so natural, and watching you feels surreal because you become so immersed in your movement. You absorb all of these choreographies, and then interpret them in such a realistic and emotional way. You have so much power and when you dance, yet you have the right amount of control to give off just the perfect amount of expression. You give care to each little gesture, and treat each move with such delicacy. It is a journey from start to finish when you dance, and you take all of us with you without missing a single detail along the way. Overall, you are one among other artists that sincerely represent our generation and capture its essence. Your innovation and relationship with music are so complex and clear at the same time. You are young, but as you become older and more experienced, there is no telling what you’re already curious and inventive mind will supply to the world. Your impact on music and your Stay will be timeless. At the same time that I love your musicality, I love your personality as well. I first noticed that you are so laid-back and have this calming demeanor. You are also unexpectedly hilarious. You make jokes in moments where nobody anticipates and you can change the entire mood of a situation in mere seconds. You are so humble, and place those around you before you no matter what the circumstances. Though I have never met you in person, you have to be one of the best people to be around and I know that your members know this better than anybody else. You really hold your team down, and together, and always find a way to make sure everybody feels included. It has only been a short time since I’ve known you, but I saw almost instantly how your members individually love and cherish you in their own special way. You bring the excitement and thrill of life to them wherever and whenever they need it. You have the biggest heart. You have stood your members up time and time again and pointed them in the right direction if ever they forget what they are chasing after. You are somebody they can lean on through all instances in their life; and have become their brother. We all know that you provide your members with a love that they could not get from anybody else. Though they are all different, you find a way to embrace this and form a sacred relationship with each of them. I know that they will continue to grow and develop, but only with you by their side to guide them through it all. They will continue to be the best versions of themselves and there is nothing that can hold them back because you believe in them with all of your heart and soul. Your love will always trail them and aid them for the rest of their lives. Thank you for raising them, and changing their lives forever so that they can lead the fullest life possible. I want to personally thank your family and parents for raising you and helping you become the aspiring young man you are today. I know how much your family means to you, and you have firsthand showed us what they mean to you and how you spend your time with them. It is clear to see that you already keep this in mind with you at all times, but I just want to say that I hope you can always rely on them in your life when you find you need somebody. When you find yourself having troubles down the line, I hope you can remember the feeling of being with them to restore you to your former state of peace and optimism. Your family loves you more than anybody else on this planet, and I hope you know that when you feel there is nobody who can understand, they will always be there to help you out of any tough situation. They are the most proud of you, will always be the most proud of you, and you honor them with every step you take towards your dream. As Stay, we keep them in our hearts as you do and hope to become as dedicated and authentic through all that we do as they are. Changbin, it is often said that Stay are the luckiest fandom in the world, and I can wholeheartedly agree with that as you are responsible for the truth behind this. You are extremely sensitive and considerate of all of our feelings, and that is perhaps one of the aspects of you that I love the most. You seem to always listen to what we have to say and are even eager to respond to it. When discussing Stay with your members or others, you always have the most original ideas and show us how much you love us through your own eyes. When we chose to become a Stay, you chose us. Your world opened up to us and you invited us to become every bit of a part of you as your members and family.  Similarly to your members, there are Stay from all over the world who come from different backgrounds, and it is only because of you that we are able to come together in unity. I know it’s not always easy to let us in and to see us while you’re in a tough situation, but the fact that you put your fears aside and show up for us every time is the greatest testament of your love for us. You are the first person we turn to when we are down and need cheering up. It is truly the greatest honor getting to be the ones that you work so hard for and trust it all to. You have faith in us when we don’t, and it gives us enough confidence to tackle whatever is thrown at us. Thank you for loving us unconditionally, and being there when nobody else has. Thank you for changing our lives, and being at the heart of the greatest days of our lives. I know that you’ve been through a lot, and you’ve only been active with Stray kids for a few mere years. I’ve seen firsthand how it took all you had and then some to even debut, and there have been too many struggles since then that you’ve faced. The best that I can do, knowing that you’ve been in these difficult situations more than anybody should be in, is try to imagine how it feels to be in your shoes. I know that it’s been a lot. All that I can say, on behalf of all of your loved ones, that we are so proud of you for making it past all of these moments. You have a heart a gold and always keep your head up even when it feels impossible, and I know that this is the reason why you’ve been able to persevere through all that you’ve been through. Thank you for teaching us that we can do the same, and for having enough ability to force a fulfilled live for your Stay and members a well. We know that you can take charge and make it out of whatever happens in the future. I hope that this birthday makes all of your dreams come true and that you accmplish all that you desire on this special day. I often wonder of when you get to take a break and truly look back on the impact that you’ve had on the world, so I hope that if anything, your special day provides you for the perfect opportunity to do that. I hope you are able to look at the countless hearts that you touch every day around the world in limitless ways, and let that make you feel as loved and honored as you’ve ever felt. I hope that those around you also help you to see how worthy of love and commemoration that you truly are. Please relax today and I hope that you spend every second making precious memories. I hope that this day goes down as one of the greatest you’ve had in a while. You deserve all of the sucess and blessings, and I know that more will only come to you. Thank you for sacrificing so much just to make Stray Kids and several other projects possible. Thank you for suffering through any pain, concern, fear, doubt, isolation, confusion, fatigue, stress, and so much more just to bring us any content at all. I hope that you never feel pressured or obligated to change because you are a rare gem of a human being. The world, and more specifically, your Stay need you just as you are to continue to inspire us and remind us what it is to love others and yourself in daily life. You are beautiful inside and out, and perfect as you are. I hope you remember we always will support you no matter what! I pray that you and your loved ones stay safe, and find happiness and worth in the future! Happy birthday Changbin, and we adore you so much!",4,2022-08-09T18:14:13Z

@suk_luvie9145,I love this song and I couldn't take my eyes off minho. He did so good!!!,4,2022-03-20T17:41:34Z
@h-playwithmyhart.4806,"Hyunjin. It was certainly your musicality that drew me to you first. You have such a playful but easy tone which highlights and gives definition to every Stray Kids song. You don’t have fixated or set rapping style. You are very experimental vocally and lyrically and I’ve found myself charmed by your voice due the versatility of it. I also love your singing style for similar reasons. You are just as diverse of a singer as you are rapper. It is really peaceful and harmonious; and blends perfectly with the rest of your members. I love how you don’t hold anything back when you’re singing and I can really feel the emotion and work that you pour into each line that you sing. Similarly to your singing and rapping, your body knows no limits when you are met with a choreography. You dance with a ferocity and a passion that no other performers can possess. You take each choreography and sincerely make it your own, which is honestly a blessing to watch. When you are dancing, you can be yourself and express your emotions with the beauty of your body movements. You can lose yourself easily into your dance and you are so comfortable and trusting of your own abilities. For this generation specifically, you have transformed music and given new meaning to what it can and should do for people. You are changing the world each day that you continue to share your artistry and dance; and we are so lucky to be alive right now to get to be a part of the history that you’re making. At the same time that I love your music and dance, I love your personality as well. I love that sometimes you keep to yourself, but other times, you are goofy and outgoing. As I mentioned before, you are extremely freeing to be around and those who spend time with you can relax and be themselves in your presence. I know that nobody can attest to these qualities quite like your members. Seven different personalities, and they all love you and cherish you for their own special reasons. They’ve looked to you and have modeled their perseverance off of how you strive to not let the difficult times hold you down and prevent you from success. You have opened your heart up to all seven people, although you come from different backgrounds, and that has encouraged them to all to have such a loving relationship with one another. You’ve had love for them since you began your journey with them and this has establishing a lifelong love that all of you had before you even debuted. You see the beauty and necessity of every single member and constantly remind them how important they are to Stray Kids. There is likely no greater feeling for them than knowing that they have you by their side if they don’t have anything else. The most important takeaway is the time they spend with you and the way you make them feel, and these are both filled with warm memories they can take with them for the rest of their lives. You’ve already spent some of the happiest and life-changing moments of your life with them, and there is still more to come. The members of Stray Kids, also your brothers and your family, couldn’t have somebody who loves them any more than you do to look after them. You are always so considerate of them and their feelings and respond to them however they need. They are the best versions of themselves because of you and because you love them just the way they are. Now, they can go on to do whatever they aspire to because you’ve encouraged them with that confidence. I want to personally thank your parents and family for raising you and helping you become the person you are today. I know they mean a lot to you, and that you couldn’t be here doing what you are without their love and support. Because of them, you can use your platform to share with the world the same love that they have provided you with your whole life. I hope you never forget that they are always going to be the most proud of you no matter what you do. They love you most in this world and they do so in a way that nobody else understands. Stay love them as you do and we keep them in our hearts as we continue our time with you. We are so grateful to them for bringing you into the world, and for changing the world the same way that you do. Hyunjin, you touch each individual heart of every Stay, and this is easily one of the most charming parts about you. It is in your nature to make each and every Stay feel special, even if you don’t know us personally. You welcome Stay from all around the world with open arms, and I felt as if I was a part of the family my whole life. You are so dedicated to your Stay and this is very apparent in everything that you do, whether it be performing or communicating with us directly. You have so much compassion for Stay and I feel like we are existing in our own separate world with you. Although we all live in different areas across the world, you take us to a place where we can all be one big family together, and it is one of the greatest feelings in the world. What you give to us is irreplaceable, and there could never be another person who helps us see the worth in ourselves the way you do. You also help us love one another. You influence others to treat others with kindness and I’ve met some of the most heartwarming Stay. I know that you help this family become closer every single day, and you remind us that if we have nothing else, we have each other. You invite us into your heart, the same way that you do your members, and you see qualities in us that we don’t even see ourselves. I know for a fact that there are Stay who only believe in themselves because of you. You also share so much of yourself with us, and this is perhaps one of the biggest ways you can show somebody that you trust. As time goes on, I notice you revealing more of yourself through your music and just through direct conversation with your Stay. You have gotten so personal with us and this lets us know just how much you actually believe in us and trust us to keep these parts of you within our hearts. There is no greater honor than to have you place this vulnerable side of you in our hands, and we want to do the same for you. I know that it is not always easy to do this, so I hope you know that we could never mislead you or betray your trust if we wanted to. You are one of the most generous people we know, and we could not be here giving love to others and to you without the love that you gave us first. I know that you’ve been through a lot, both personally, and professionally, and that your time as an idol has not always been easy or enjoyable. You’ve been active for some time now, but during your training period alone, you’ve been met with demanding expectations, which many people cannot even say they’ve undergone. Just as your family is, Stay could not be more proud of you from overcoming your hardships and making it out on the brighter side. Each time you are met with a grueling time or task, thought it make time, you eventually endure through it until the end, and become more experienced. As Stay, I can say we learn so much from how you choose to release stress or convey how you’re feeling through the mediums that provide you comfort.  We are beyond proud of you and continue to learn from you each day. I hope that this birthday makes all of your dreams come true, and you can take the time to truly celebrate who you are as a person. I know it might be difficult to focus on yourself, and if you find this to be the case, I hope you leave it to those who surround you and your admiring fans from all across the world to help you realize how revolutionary of a person you are. You are truly a gifted musician, and a courteous and selfless individual. You deserve this day, and every day that follows, to feel as appreciated as you truly are. I hope that every second is filled with memories that are unforgettable, and that this will be one of the greatest days that you’ve had! Please have fun and celebrate in whatever way you choose, because your Stay will be cheering with you!  Thank you for sacrificing your time, efforts, pain, doubt, fear, tears, emotions, and physical boundaries just to bring us any content at all. For every effort that you put in that you might think is small, a Stay’s mood or day is completely changed for the better. You are blessing to this world and continue to change it every day with how you choose to heal it and the people living in it. I hope you don’t overwork yourself because you are perfect just the way you present yourself to us. We will support you and be there for you for the rest of our lives! I pray that you and your loved ones stay safe, and find happiness and worth in the future. Happy birthday Hyunjin, and we adore you so much!!",15,2022-03-20T05:59:01Z

안녕 난 어디든
비행할 수 있는 청소년
그렇다고 비행 청소년은
아냐 다 Attention
 
난 나보다 약한 건 안 건드려
센 것들만 골라내서 모두 제껴
순한 양이었다가도 목표 앞에 맹수
야옹
 
내 패기를 뱉어 내 백퍼
내 배를 채울 목표는 지구 반대편에
태워 내 포기는 보이지 내 객기 매일
올라가는 내 모습 마치
하늘 향한 우주선
내 앞길은 창창해서
태양마저 갈 길을 비춰

난 유달리 원하는 건 차지해
목표 위를 날지
날라리는 아냐
 
산 넘어 산 걍 넘어가
강 넘어 강 다 넘어가
산 넘어 산맥 강 넘어 바다
다 넘어가 그 담을 넘봐

순한 양이었다가도 목표 앞에 맹수 (야옹)
내 패기를 뱉어 내 백퍼
내 배를 채울 목표는 지구 반대편에 태워

@Leyelle,"My honest first impression of Stray Kids: (when I first heard if them and then watched an interview before hearing any songs)

Stray Kids: kinda edgy and emo, not really confirming to the industry (because I only knew they had a song called Hellavator)

Chris: very Aussie, kinda acts like a white mom

Lee Know: Handsome

Changbin: Smart, deep and really thinks before he speaks but is kinda quiet and doesn't draw attention

Hyunjin: kinda the pouty rich pretty boy. Really a dandy and probably thinks highly of himself and isn't used to being around other boys, especially loud rough ones

Han: loud and likes speaking English

Felix: has freckles and a really deep voice. Is tiny

Seungmin: ????? Quiet and peaceful

I.N.: obsessed with Hyunjin

Almost a year later and I discovered I'm not really wrong. I guess sometimes you could judge people off their first impression",3,2020-12-09T00:02:35Z

ALSO I think that we should str3m Levanter, I Am YOU, and Side Effects! They are all amazing and the deserve 100 million by the end of this year!!

@whoisconihey3625,"Pajaritos chilenos

Para celebrar el 18, no debe de faltar los ricos pajaritos ❤

￼Bonny

Ingredientes

1 kilo harina

1 taza azúcar

1 pan de levadura

1 pizca sal

4 yemas de huevos

Ralladura de limón

Clavo de olor

125 gramos mantequilla

1 Taza leche tibia

---- Para el merengue :

4 claras de huevo

1 taza azúcar

Pasos

En un bol colocar la harina hacer un orificio tipo volcán, introducir todos los ingredientes y amasar hasta que la masa quedé blandita, dejar en un bol por media hora hasta que suba la masa

Una vez que haya pasado la media hora hacer lulitos del tamaño del puño de la mano y aplastarlos un poquito, luego ponerlo en la lata del horno y dejarlos reposar por una hora hasta que suba otra vez los pajaritos, una vez pasada la hora se lleva a horno por media hora dependiendo el horno que tengas en casa dejar enfriar y decorarlos con merengue.

Preparación del merengue : poner las cuatro claras de huevos con la taza de azúcar a baño María esperar que se disuelvan los cristales de azúcar y empezar a batir en batidora a nivel alto hasta que el merengue quedé durito, unos 10 minutos incluso menos, les recomiendo que batan hasta conseguir la consistencia que a ustedes más les guste

Una vez listo el merengue agregarlo a los pajaritos",0,2020-09-17T16:24:13Z
