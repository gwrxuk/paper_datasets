@hafsasheikh0127,"the lyrics are absolutely heart-quenching and evocative! they kinda demonstrate how our souls are afraid to lose us, lose the real us, what we have always been. They fail to locate the old happy us because of the change taking over due to the negative side of the fast growing internet generation, insecurity, depression and endless problems of life.",1,2023-06-05T15:56:33Z
