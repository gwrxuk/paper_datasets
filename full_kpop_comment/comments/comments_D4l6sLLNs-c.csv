@bbcarat,"Baby Carat here, barely a month old! The first time I heard this song, I thought to myself, I’ve never heard such strong emotions expressed in a song before — in every line sung, the emotions felt so palpable. 

S,coups, I hope whatever it is that troubled you when you wrote this has already been left in the past. And if there are any more worries left in your heart now, know that you are never alone. So many people love you and care about you. Continue shining! We have your back, always 💎",13,2025-02-06T18:32:03Z

@scoupsii,"“승철, **‘Me’**가 제게 얼마나 큰 의미인지 표현할 방법이 없습니다. 처음 이 노래를 들었을 때부터, 당신의 목소리와 가사는 제게 계속해서 위로가 되어왔어요. 당신의 목소리는 마치 모든 것이 괜찮을 거라고 느끼게 해주는 안전하고 이해받는 감정을 주는 것 같아요. 당신이 담아낸 감정이 매 순간 깊이 울리고, 당신의 가사에 담긴 고뇌와 성장, 힘이 제 마음을 말로 표현할 수 없이 깊이 다가옵니다. 당신의 생각을 이렇게 개인적이면서도 보편적인 가사로 풀어내는 능력을 항상 존경해왔어요. 당신의 글쓰기는 정말 특별하고, 사람의 마음에 직접 닿는 방식이 있어요. 그 점은 절대 변하지 않기를 바랍니다. 제발, 계속 글을 써주세요. 세상은 당신의 목소리와 가사, 그리고 우리가 혼자가 아니라는 느낌을 받을 수 있는 당신의 말을 필요로 해요. 새 음악을 작업 중이라고 들었어요. 그 소식에 너무 기대가 돼요. 앞으로 당신이 만들어낼 모든 음악도 지금까지 해온 것처럼 아름답고 의미 있을 거라고 믿어요. 제게 필요한 위로가 되어주어서 고맙고, 가장 힘든 날에도 세상의 아름다움을 볼 수 있게 해준 곡들에 정말 감사해요.”",1,2025-01-12T18:54:12Z
@scoupsii,"seungcheol there are no words that can fully express how much ‘Me’ means to me. From the moment I first heard it, your voice and the lyrics have been a constant source of comfort. Your voice has a way of making me feel safe and understood, like everything will be okay no matter what. The emotions you pour into every note resonate so deeply, and the way your words reflect your struggles, growth, and strength touches my heart in ways I can’t describe. I’ve always admired your ability to put your thoughts into lyrics that feel so personal yet universal. Your writing is truly special you have a way of speaking directly to the soul, and it’s something I hope never changes. Please, never stop writing. The world needs your voice, your words, and the way you make us feel like we’re not alone. I’ve heard you’re working on new music, and I can’t wait to hear it. Whatever you create next, I know it will be just as beautiful and meaningful as everything you’ve shared so far. Thank you for being the comfort I didn’t know I needed, and for writing songs that help me see the beauty in everything, even on the hardest days",1,2025-01-12T18:53:21Z

歌詞を知った今、クプスがいつの時代のクプスを思い浮かべて書いた歌詞がわからないけど、その頃のクプスをただ抱きしめて愛で包み込みたいと思うよ。
生きているだけでいいってよくいうけど、生きるってすごく難しいことだよね。小さなことから大きなことまで1日のうちに何度も選択があって、選択を悔やんで…毎日その繰り返し。どうしようもない状態で誰かに言う勇気もなくて自分自身がどうでもよくて人生を辞めてしまいたくなることも沢山あるけど、SEVENTEENに出会えたからここまで生きてきて良かったと思える。
エスクプスが、スンチョルが、今日という日まで生きてきて良かったと心の底から思える日が来ますように。
時に負担になるかもしれないけど、時には救いになると思うからこの言葉をかけます。
沢山の人がエスクプスという人を、スンチョルという人を愛しています。

Both had saved us from the pit of darkness. Thank you for being the light we needed so we can cling on that tiny hope.

@kidult2107,"난 (Me) Lyrics with english trans 

:)

[Verse 1]
어젯밤 꿈속에서 다른 나를 꿈꿨어
지금 거울 앞에 나 말고 다른 날
도망치고 싶은 맘 그게 참 쉬웠나봐
어쩌면 벼랑 끝에서 다른 날 찾아

Last night, I dreamed of a different me
Now, in the mirror, it's not me, but another me
The desire to escape, it's seems so easy
Maybe at the cliff edge, looking for another me

[Pre-Chorus]
매일 현관문을 밀고 나설 때
다른 사람이 된 기분을 느껴
내 안과 밖에 다른 두 개의 세상이
손가락질 해 겁쟁이라 욕 해

Every day, when I push open the front door
I feel like becoming a different person
Inside and outside, two separate worlds
Pointing fingers, calling mr a coward, cursing me

[Chorus]
두 개의 이름의 나는
두 개의 삶을 살어
내 어떤 삶을 사랑하나요
두 개가 나인 나는
마음이 하나라서
당신에게 난 하날거예요

I am someone with two names
Living two different worlds
Which of these lives do I love?
As the two (names) are in me
Because My heart is one
I will be one for you

[Post-Chorus]
난 (난), 난 (난)
난, ooh, 난
두 개가 나인 나는
마음이 하나라서
당신에게 난 하날거예요
난

Me (me) me (me)
Me, ooh me
As the two (names) are in me
Because My heart is one
I will be one for you
Me

[Verse 2]
비린내 나는 그 입 좀 닥쳐봐
그게 내 몸에 밴지도 몰라
쉽게 뱉은 말은 모두 거짓말, 그렇게 거짓말
그게 사실이 돼
그럴 때 난
아무 말도 못했어
아무 것도 못했어
그래서 난

Shout your fishy mouth
I dont even know if its on my body
Easily spoken words, they're all lies
Such lies soon become the truth
At moment like those
I couldn't say or do anything
That's why, I

[Pre-Chorus]
다시 현관문을 밀고 나설 때
다른 사람이 된 기분을 느껴
내 안과 밖에 다른 두 개의 세상이
손가락질 해 겁쟁이라 욕 해

Again, when I push open the front door
I feel like becoming a different person
Inside and outside, two separate worlds
Pointing fingers, calling mr a coward, cursing me

[Chorus]
두 개의 이름의 나는
두 개의 삶을 살어
내 어떤 삶을 사랑하나요
두 개가 나인 나는
마음이 하나라서
당신에게 난 하날거예요

I am someone with two names
Living two different lives
Which of these lives do I love?
As the two (names) are in me
Because My heart is one
I will be one for you

[Post-Chorus]
난 (난), 난 (난)
난, ooh, 난
죽고 싶었던 나의
손목을 놓지 않은
당신에게 난 하날거예요
난

Me (me) me (me)
Me ooh me
To you 
who didn't let go of my hands
when I want to die T.T

@vboldoy,"Letra en español

Anoche soñé con un yo diferente
Ahora, en el espejo, no soy yo, sino otro yo
El deseo de escapar, parece tan fácil
Quizás, al borde del acantilado, buscando otro yo

[Pre-Estribillo]
Cada día, cuando abro la puerta de entrada
Siento que me convierto en una persona diferente
Por dentro y por fuera, dos mundos separados
Señalando con el dedo, llamándome cobarde, maldiciéndome

[Estribillo]
Soy alguien con dos nombres
Viviendo dos vidas diferentes
¿Qué vida amas? Como los dos en mí son uno
Mi corazón es uno
Seré uno para ti

[Post-Estribillo]
Yo, yo
Yo, ooh, yo
Como los dos en mí son uno
Mi corazón es uno
Seré uno para ti
Yo

[Verso 2]
Cierra tu boca de pescado
Ni siquiera sé si está en mi cuerpo
Palabras fáciles de decir, todas mentiras, esas mentiras
Se convierten en la verdad
En momentos como esos, yo
No podía decir nada
No podía hacer nada
Por eso, yo

[Pre-Estribillo]
De nuevo, al empujar la puerta principal para abrirla
Siento que me convierto en una persona diferente
Por dentro y por fuera, dos mundos separados
Señalando con el dedo, llamándome cobarde, maldiciéndome

[Estribillo]
Soy alguien con dos nombres
Viviendo dos vidas diferentes
¿Qué vida amas?
Como los dos en mí son uno
Mi corazón es uno
Seré uno para ti

[Post-Estribillo]
Yo, yo
Yo, ooh, yo
Como los dos en mí son uno
El yo que quería morir
Aferrándose a mis muñecas
Seré uno para ti

these days there are more videos of scoups being hurt on stage because of his injury. while i understand that it's something that will continue to happen and that he just wants to perform for carats and be on stage with the members... i still feel very upset whenever i see him in pain. knowing that he's a grown up man and can make right decisions for his health, i still worry a lot. it's natural to worry about people you like. it's even more natural when the list of people you like is very limited. i've heard that wonwoo and the8 had health problems as well recently? i really hope the members get to rest now that one part of the tour is over. knowing how hard they work to achieve their dreams, to make carats happy... i don't want to lose this moment, so we need to be careful and patient, so we can be together and see each other for a long time",1,2024-11-11T09:58:31Z

@yingtaobeojji,"good morning! it was hard to fall asleep last night, i kept thinking about seungkwan's post, everything people's been talking about yesterday. i'm not good at words. if i knew that a member could read this, i would've tried harder. but as someone who comes here and shares words amongst other carats... i think i get get away with mumbling? we've all had a time like this, when you just want to say something out loud

it's so painful to think that not much can be done to help? at moments like this, it feels like you want to become a shield for those you love, you want to curse everyone who's been cruel and unfair to the members. as situations progress, all most of us can do is check news updates and hope for the best. and that, in the end, the members don't get hurt even more. they've never let me down, but it feels like i'm letting them down by not being able to protect them.

i selfishly worry about the group status as well. whenever something happens, i always worry, because i cannot imagine life without seventeen and their music. after so many years, i'm worried, and i don't want to say goodbye. but, when i think about it, it's health and peace, that's what i want for the members. and that's the only thing that should matter to me as a fan. because of how much happiness and strength the members have given us, they deserve to have freedom to be able to live the happiest versions of their lives.

and it goes to other artists and fans as well. although i won't ever understand the hardships artists go through,  as a fan, i wish the world was kinder to artists. i wish their fans were also nicer to them. 

i'm happy that seventeen members have each other to rely on and trust. i hope the team's bond is never broken, no matter what. as long as they have each other, it's going to be okay, right?",2,2024-10-29T06:47:16Z

when i think about it, i've waited for seventeen debut for quite long. so waiting for the end of military service is not a problem, i'm used to waiting. when you're waiting for something or someone, you get to look through happy memories, you get excited, and you feel twice as happy once the time to meet comes.

@yingtaobeojji,"i always come here in the mornings, but after the latest announcement i feel so sad, i decided to come here again. it's been months, so this song is my biggest safe space. being a fan is difficult, sometimes your happiness depends on the idols you've chosen and their well-being. to me, if jeonghan's military service goes well, if he's healthy, that's all that matters. actor jun is something we've all loved and praised, so i hope for success and i wish jun good luck. 
i guess many carats are going to be sad they won't see 13 members on stage during tour, but, as i've never been to a concert and i never will, i don't think i'm allowed to feel upset about the tour. in the end, it's still seventeen, same songs, same vibes.
i've waited for debut for so long, i think i can wait for the 13 members reunion for a long time. no matter what, i know that i will wait, since seventeen are the most important artists to me. as long as everyone is healthy and well, it's going to be alright. a year later, five or ten years later, it doesn't matter

i looked for pets that were up for adoption, i did it because i couldnt fall asleep, and i simply fell in love with this kitten. i've thought of it for a while, and finally brought it home yesterday. it was so hard to contact the shelter, but i was super annoying and got a reply after all.
i cannot think of a name yet. it has to be something related to seventeen, but i don't think it's a good idea to name a cat after a member, is it? i'm so lost. i thought that it could be anything, even a kind of food/dish. but it would be more meaningful if i could capture my love for seventeen, it could be a reminder for many years. if i  cannot find any ideas, i think i'll just go with 'cherry', but it's a hard decision to make...",2,2024-08-10T08:15:41Z

it made me a little sad that seungcheol is going to take a break next year, but i think health is more important than anything. if we want to be together for a long time, seventeen and carats, we need to take good care of our health. in my carat time, i've already waited for members. it's not easy, when you're a fan, but it's rewarding when they come back in better physical and mental health. seeing people you love smile happily is very rewarding, knowing that your idols are taking good care of themselves is something to be thankful for.",2,2024-08-09T05:07:38Z

@yingtaobeojji,"good morning!
these days i see many sad posts from new carats, many of them are upset they didn't meet seventeen earlier. it's got even worse once caratland ended. i cannot share their feelings well, as i've been with seventeen from the very beginning, but i can understand them a little. it's hard to find the right words to cheer up these people? after all, when i think about it, being with seventeen for 12 years or for 1 month... none of this is enough, as seventeen are so good. and no matter what's waiting for us in the end, i'm going to be just as sad as the others.
come to think of it, i won't be interested in kpop unless seventeen exists. i don't think i truly realise their impact on me, i don't think i am able to comprehend the amount of love i've got for the members. this love is something that cannot be measured and cannot be explained with words of any language",2,2024-07-31T08:54:38Z

these days i'm amazed with the amount of content with hoshi's latte. we went from knowing nothing to seeing latte more often than some of the members? because i love dogs so much, i'm happy about all the attention latte is getting. i think we need more seventeen dog content 😊

carat land day 2 was even better?! didn't think it was possible after day 1, but seventeen are doing the impossible. i'm so grateful

world tour announcement was a bit expected, so i wasn't shocked. well, maybe that's because i cannot attend concerts. because of that, i don't get shocked about such news. i left my dreams of seeing seventeen perform live, i left these dreams behind many years ago. but i feel genuinely happy for others, whenever i see other carats' posts. every time someone says 'i hope they come to ___' i agree and hope for the same thing. if my dream cannot come true, many others should have an opportunity to fulfil theirs",6,2024-07-25T04:09:07Z

@yingtaobeojji,"good morning! i'm so happy i got to watch carat land yesterday! and i cannot wait for day 2. even if it's an online stream, it's very exciting and emotional. i cannot think of a part i liked most because each performance and game was such high quality and fun. the units changing performances, the unfitting songs for each member, the old music which seventeen performed, the 'call call call' performance.... all of that and more, it all made me so happy. come to think of it, seventeen are always making us happy and proud, seventeen never disappoint and always do their best. 
the whole 'youth with seventeen' hits hard home, considering i've been with them since i was about 15. thank you for making my youth brighter, and i hope that we, as fans, are making seventeen youth better with our love.

i've never missed official streams like that, but it's going to be hard to watch it this year because i work on both days. if i try hard, i will be able to watch some parts, and then watch everything as the recordings. this year is going to be a special year, so i'm looking forward to it",3,2024-07-22T09:32:56Z

on the good side, i'm forever grateful that our leader has never let me down. i'm thankful that the idols i've chosen to love are good people, i'm proud to call myself a carat",1,2024-07-18T07:55:02Z

i don't understand much when i watch lives, but i still enjoy watching them. if i cannot go to concerts, live streams are my closest option to seeing seventeen 'live'. 
i'm grateful scoups notified us about the live, told us about it yesterday. because of that, i was able to move around my plans and free up my time. i'm very excited!

also i watched Spirited Away in the cinema yesterday, so i'm still happy from that. i love Ghibli so much",2,2024-07-10T06:38:00Z

@chocochansta,"[Verse 1]
어젯밤 꿈속에서 다른 나를 꿈꿨어
지금 거울 앞에 나 말고 다른 날
도망치고 싶은 맘 그게 참 쉬웠나봐
어쩌면 벼랑 끝에서 다른 날 찾아

[Pre-Chorus]
매일 현관문을 밀고 나설 때
다른 사람이 된 기분을 느껴
내 안과 밖에 다른 두 개의 세상이
손가락질 해 겁쟁이라 욕 해

[Chorus]
두 개의 이름의 나는
두 개의 삶을 살아
내 어떤 삶을 사랑하나요
두 개가 나인 나는
마음이 하나라서
당신에게 난 하날 거예요

[Post-Chorus]
난 (난), 난 (난)
난, ooh, 난
두 개가 나인 나는
마음이 하나라서
당신에게 난 하날 거예요
난

[Verse 2]
비린내 나는 그 입 좀 닥쳐봐
그게 내 몸에 밴지도 몰라
쉽게 뱉은 말은 모두 거짓말, 그렇게 거짓말
그게 사실이 돼
그럴 때 난
아무 말도 못했어
아무 것도 못했어
그래서 난

[Pre-Chorus]
다시 현관문을 밀고 나설 때
다른 사람이 된 기분을 느껴
내 안과 밖에 다른 두 개의 세상이
손가락질 해 겁쟁이라 욕 해

[Chorus]
두 개의 이름의 나는
두 개의 삶을 살아
내 어떤 삶을 사랑하나요
두 개가 나인 나는
마음이 하나라서
당신에게 난 하날 거예요

[Post-Chorus]
난 (난), 난 (난)
난, ooh, 난
죽고 싶었던 나의
손목을 놓지 않은
당신에게 난 하날 거예요
난

 seventeen made history yesterday, let's achieve many more things together!
i loved seeing our leader do some choreo. i loved seeing scoups and jeonghan dancing. my favourite part was seeing all 13 members perform. because life's difficult and unpredictable sometimes, it's important to cherish every moment together. to show love and support while you can. to be there for those you chose as your safe space 🩷🩵",2,2024-06-29T06:29:34Z

@Dailycoups,"승철아
나는 너가 억지로 눈을 뜬 피곤한 아침도 이상하리만큼 상쾌했으면 좋겠고, 
너를 괴롭히는 것들은 천천히 부는 바람에 날려 작별할수 있으면 좋겠어. 
다른 사람들이 너에게 하는 말들은 다 네 마음에 꽃을 심는 것처럼 예쁜 말뿐이었으면 좋겠고 
먹고 싶은 것들은 다 먹었으면 좋겠어. 잠들때는 뒤척이지 않고 단잠에 푹 빠졌음 좋겠고
너를 골치아프게 하는것들은 알아서 비켜갔으면 좋겠어.
고요한 새벽이 활기찬 아침이 언제나 너에게 선물이면 좋겠어. 
이제 미래를 생각할 땐 불안이 아닌 여유로움이 가득 차 있었으면 좋겠어. 
혹여 힘든 일이 생겨도 널 굳건하고 단단한 사람으로 만들어 줄 정도로만, 
네가 거뜬히 이겨낼 정도로만 너에게 찾아오면 좋겠어. 
너의 곁에는 별다른 이유 없이 따듯함이 가득했으면 좋겠어. 
그렇게 너의 삶이 고요하고 평화롭게, 때로는 뜨겁게 흘러갔으면 좋겠어. 


승철아 너는 한번도 나에게 자랑스럽지 않은 적이 없었고 
나의 행복이었고 자부심이었어.
내 아티스트가 되어줘서 고마워.
앞으로 너가가는 길을 언제나 응원할게.
나의 자리에서 언제나 묵묵히 응원할게.
너는 더 높은 곳으로 올라가 더 찬란히 빛나기를.
지는 해가 되어도 두려워하지 않기를.
너는 달빛에도 빛날 사람이니.
너가 깊이 그리고 사무치게 행복하기를.",12,2024-06-26T14:08:35Z

@yourbossisonline7108,"Coming back to ur song from time to time, as i may not be updated with u coz im not really into kpop thingy...
hope u r okay all the time.
Dont over burden urself..
U r handsome without makeup..
U will be loved even if u dont act cute..
Try to be more authentic so u dont regret things at the end of the day. Be ursefl to the extent that u can push it in the kpop industry...
I hope ur teammates also dont force u to do things u dont like in the name of entertainment..if he doesnt wanna act cute..leave him. (some kpop idols are able to stay true to themselves bcoz their teammates let them be....they dont call eachother unprofessional just bcoz he cant do aegyo..)

A real fan will accept him just as he is..
If u count urself a fan and then force him to do aegyo knowing he doesnt really like it then ur not really a fan.",1,2024-06-25T01:02:15Z

그렇게 멍하니 있는데 너가 올려준 연습실 거울셀카가 생각나더라. 그제서야 그게 꿈인걸 알았어. 그리고 살아있어서 다행이라고 안도했어.

@yingtaobeojji,"good morning! last night, as i was reading posts and articles online, i felt like crying. for some reason, whenever good things and success come our way, something bad always follows. i don't know if it's all just a coincidence, but that's how it feels. and i've been a carat since trainee days.

i wish there was a way to show love and support seventeen directly, without any third parties :) i never know who to believe, i find it hard to trust people. but, in the end, the members are the only ones i believe and i can trust. 

as long as seventeen and carats are together, it's going to be fine, right? this comeback is so precious, i want to stay in this happy moment for a little longer. 13 members together on stage, the anniversary is around the corner, the members are finally performing at Nissan Stadium!? i want to keep this as a happy memory, even if happiness often comes with a bit of bitterness.

'cheers to youth' music video came out yesterday, i cried so hard whilst watching it. the song doesn't make me that emotional because my korean is quite bad, i turn off my brain whilst listening. but because the music video had visuals, it made me so sad, i couldn't stop crying. i didn't expect to react like that... i think i watch 'maestro', 'lalali' and 'spell' music videos for a few times every day, but i don't know if i can watch 'cheers to youth' again without crying. but i love it so much ah i love seventeen so much",1,2024-05-24T07:54:00Z

Scoups have soo much talent. Sometimes people ignore him, it's not like people purposely ignore him or anything...Idk I think he is not being as much recognized as he should.

i've watched some videos from the recent concerts, i got sad once again, i always get a little sad because i cannot attend concerts. but i'm always happy in the end. even if i cannot go, i'll always be happy as long as seventeen can do concerts. i hope seventeen have many many wonderful concerts in the future. 
ah, there was also a single album announcement. it wasn't shocking because we've been prepared for a jeonghan and wonwoo duo. i'm always excited for new music, especially from seventeen members",1,2024-05-20T10:11:38Z

Spell music video came out yesterday, but there was also lalali behind the scenes video. even after the promotions are over, there's still so much content. it's hard to keep up, but i'm trying. it must've been even harder to film all of that, so i shouldn't be complaining. i'm enjoying the amount of content, especially considering there are 13 members again now. because of all the past events throughout the years, i have learned to appreciate and not take for granted such wonderful moments",2,2024-05-17T08:14:52Z

@yingtaobeojji,"good morning! it's my birthday today, so i'm starting my day well and listening to my favourite song. i will work all day, so there won't be much fun happening.
i wonder if there will be any posts or lives from the members? those that happen on my birthday always have a special place in my heart. even though i cannot watch anything during the day, i wonder if there will be anything at all? 
i'm 27 now and it feels surreal. i was like 15 when i found seungcheol and pledis trainees. time is so fast....",1,2024-05-07T06:33:06Z

@fatimazahraeteeema,"Hello Seungcheol 
I want to tell you that you did a very wonderful job and the song was kind of sad and full of emotions even though I am not Korean most of the words I did not understand but do you know that feeling like a heart connection, I cried a lot because I remembered myself when I was going through a hard time The song and your wonderful voice were the best and from this I want you When you feel the same feeling or worse, Share this with the carat, so that we may relieve you of the pain, even a little, and this talk is generally addressed to everyone (members and carats), so let's stay healthy and not hate ourselves.  ❤️😭❤️❤️‍🩹🍒🍒",4,2024-05-06T12:43:26Z

@yingtaobeojji,"good morning! well, afternoon. i slept for so long because i went to bed late, i was watching movies and embroidering. 

i caught up with all comeback videos now! i think i've heard maestro thousands of times. i have this song in my playlists, but i also watch all performances and all 13 fancams... sometimes there's also a face cam... 😮
but it's a good thing the song is so good, i can listen to it all day long

i wonder what kind of a hairstyle seungcheol will get now? because i saw a weverse post of him choosing between black and blue? i think everyone looks more handsome with natural hair, so i'm a big fan of black colour. but... when you bleach and damage your hair for red... i think it's better to try all colours, since it's already bleached? seungcheol looked so cool with blue hair before, i think he'll look even better now because he's more mature? 🥰",2,2024-05-06T08:57:59Z

@Kim_Wooahae,"[Verse 1]
Last night, I dreamed of a different me
The other one than the one standing in front of the mirror
The desire to run away, I guess that was easy
Perhaps I'll find the other me at the edge of the cliff

[Pre-Chorus]
When I push through the front door everyday
I feel like becoming a different person
The two different worlds inside and outside of me
Pointing fingers, cursing, and calling me a coward

[Chorus]
Me, with two namеs
Live two lives
Which one do you lovе?
Despite the two of me
I have one heart
So to you, I am one

[Post-Chorus]
Me (Me), me (Me)
Me, ooh, me
Despite the two of me
I have one heart
So to you, I am one
Me

[Verse 2]
Shut that fishy mouth
I don't even know if that stuck to my body
All the words said easily were lies, and all those lies
Become the truth
At times like that
Couldn't say anything
Couldn't do anything
So I

[Pre-Chorus]
When I push through the front door again
I feel like becoming a different person
The two different worlds inside and outside of me
Pointing fingers, cursing, and calling me a coward

[Chorus]
Me, with two names
Live two lives
Which one do you love?
Despite the two of me
I have one heart
So to you, I am one

[Post-Chorus]
Me (Me), me (Me)
Me, ooh, me
You didn't let go of my wrist
When I wanted to die
So to you, I am one
Me

[Verse 1]
어젯밤 꿈속에서 다른 나를 꿈꿨어
지금 거울 앞에 나 말고 다른 날
도망치고 싶은 맘 그게 참 쉬웠나봐
어쩌면 벼랑 끝에서 다른 날 찾아

[Pre-Chorus]
매일 현관문을 밀고 나설 때
다른 사람이 된 기분을 느껴
내 안과 밖에 다른 두 개의 세상이
손가락질 해 겁쟁이라 욕 해

[Chorus]
두 개의 이름의 나는
두 개의 삶을 살아
내 어떤 삶을 사랑하나요
두 개가 나인 나는

당신에게 난 하날 거예요

비린내 나는 그 입 좀 닥쳐봐
그게 내 몸에 밴지도 몰라
쉽게 뱉은 말은 모두 거짓말, 그렇게 거짓말
그게 사실이 돼
그럴 때 난
아무 말도 못했어
아무 것도 못했어
그래서 난

@yingtaobeojji,"good morning! i went to a concert yesterday. it was a concert of a local singer who started his career in 2000. i've been his fan for over 20 years, and i was so happy to finally see him live after so long. it made me think that i shouldn't give up on seeing seventeen live. sometimes i think that... i've been a fan for many years, but i've never had a chance to go to a seventeen concert. before debut, i was so sure i would always attend every concert, i was so determined. now that i think about it, i hope to go to a concert in the future. i now think it is more possible. and, the more time passes, the more exciting the concert feels. that's how i feel",0,2024-04-27T08:00:48Z

today's a big day because i'm getting new tattoos! my first one was dedicated to seventeen, and i wanted to keep going, so i'll be getting one tattoo for each member. today, i'm getting a flower which Seungcheol once drew, it looks super pretty, and it will remind me of him. i'm also getting one of the cats our Jun has drawn. even though i like dogs more, Jun is always so excited about those cats. i want something like that to keep as a memory.",0,2024-04-25T03:50:50Z

these days i look at fancall videos with our leader, some of the calls are quite fun! seungcheol's hair is fading out, but it looks even prettier this way. i also got half of my hair coloured, and it's fading out just as fast. but that's the beauty of it, i think.

2023年は本当に私にとってすごく辛くて、生きることを諦めてしまいそうなぐらい辛かった。
けれど、やっぱり手を差し伸べてくれたのはクプスでありSEVENTEENだったんだよ。私の心を救えるのはクプスしかいなくて、私は貴方のために生きるしか意味が見つけられなかった。私は貴方たちみたいに居場所も仲間も愛も無ければ、それを得るための努力もできない。けれど、そんな私でもこの世界で生きたい、生きなければいけないと思えたのは
エスクプスとSEVENTEENのおかげでした。こんな私に生きる意味と生きる希望をくれてありがとう。
本当に辛い時は、私たちの目の前から姿を消してでも、信頼する仲間と愛する人たちと幸せでいてください。
あなたたちの幸せが私の幸せです。

@yingtaobeojji,"good morning to my favourite song! yesterday was such a good day, all because of the concert. i worked, but i checked the live stream a few times. unfortunately, i missed most of it, but i was still happy. i'm just happy to know our seventeen are performing together again. i will watch more fan videos and look at photos after work today. ah i have to work all day today, i think i will catch up with everything on Monday. i have a lot of free time on Monday.
as much as seeing 13 members together, i am just happy to see Seungcheol back on stage. even if he cannot take part in every performance, his presence makes everything better. we should be grateful for the new hair colour, too. because it's so bright, it was easy to follow our leader and see if he's performing or not. since we haven't seen him in so long, it was very useful.

i keep thinking if i can ever attend a concert like that, i think about how the clock is ticking. length doesn't matter much, but i've been a carat for so many years. if i never have a chance, that would be devastating.",0,2024-03-31T07:00:12Z

좋은점이.. 전주가 산뜻한 멜로디라 좋고, 목소리는 저음인데 기교나 습관이 없고 담백해서 좀 무거울 수 있는 가사가 산뜻하게 들려요
가성부분이 여리고 시원한 느낌이라 예쁘고, 다 좋은데 나아아우워~ 이렇게(;;) 올리는 부분이 질리지 않고 넘 듣기 좋습니당

@elviavroragemini,"I'm writing in English because I'm afraid the translator in Korean will say ""bye"" to my meaning) I'm here after the news about the army. I'm sure that your friends, family and fans support you and stay by your side, I'm not worried about it. But I worry that you would be by yourself and become a strong support for yourself, because this is very important. I'm sure you'll get better over time, you'll run and jump around having fun with other guys. I really hope so. It's okay to fall, right? Everyone is falling. But the main thing is to get up after the fall and take small steps further. And people, especially haters, they talked, they talk and they will talk. It started as soon as the human species appeared on earth. Usually, when a person is happy, they don't want to hurt another person. We can only feel sorry for them. So, let's just look ahead, pay less attention to dirty tricks, pay more attention to the good around you. Be healthy and happy.💎",30,2024-03-05T09:12:47Z

@_pracky_,"사랑하는 승철아, 일단은 내 메시지나 어떤 메시지도 읽지 않았으면 좋겠다.
세상은 불안으로 가득 찬 사람들이 사는 무서운 곳입니다. 그러나 그러한 불안감에 따라 행동하고 다른 사람을 무너뜨리려고 하는 사람들은 회복할 수 없을 만큼 피해를 입습니다. 하지만 그래도 좋은 일들만 보셨으면 좋겠습니다.

당신이 밝게 빛날 때, 당신의 빛은 다른 사람들이 자신의 최고의 잠재력에 부응하지 못하고 있다는 사실을 일깨울 것입니다. 그것은 일부 사람들이 인정하고 싶어하지 않는다는 고통스러운 알림입니다. 당신을 싫어하는 사람들은 (타당한 이유 없이) 당신이 한 일이나 하지 못한 일 때문에 당신을 싫어하는 것이 아니라, 당신이 그들에게 그들 자신의 내면에서 직면할 준비가 되어 있지 않은 것을 상기시키기 때문에 당신을 싫어할 것입니다. 게다가, 자신의 고통이나 목적을 인식하지 못하는 사람은 자신의 좌절감과 부족함을 다른 사람에게 투사하는 경우가 많습니다.
비가 와도, 햇빛이 와도 캐럿들은 언제나 여러분 곁에 있을 것입니다. 우리 세봉이들이 지어준 이름에 걸맞게 살아갈게요 - ""더 빛나게 해주는 캐럿들"" ❤",4,2024-03-02T22:12:50Z
@_pracky_,"Dear Seungcheol, for once I hope you dont read my message or any message in fact.
The world is a scary place with people full of insecurities. But those who act on those insecurities and try to bring down other people are damaged beyond repair. But i still hope you only see good things. 
When you shine bright, your light will awaken others to the fact that they're not living up to their highest potential, it's a painful reminder that some don't want to acknowledge. Those who dislike you (without valid reason), will very often dislike you not because of anything that you have done or failed to do, but because you remind them of something that they're not ready to face within themselves. Only someone who is not aware of their own pain or purpose will project their frustrations and inadequacies onto everyone else. 
Carats will always stand by your side, in rain and in sunshine. We will live upto our name that our sebongies have given us -  ""Carats who make them shine brighter"" ❤",8,2024-03-02T22:10:55Z

@svetjemali,I mean I cannot understand people throwing hate to Coups. It's not even his decision it was military decision and I think that Cheol would always choose to serve the military without any problem if he didn't have such grave injury. He is not the type to be scared but I hope he can be strong enough to survive unnecessary hate people are throwing at him. True carats will always support him whatever happens and I hope he knows that. ❤🍒,62,2024-03-02T19:52:03Z

어쩌면 벼랑 끝에서 다른 날 찾아

매일 현관문을 밀고 나설 때
다른 사람이 된 기분을 느껴
내 안과 밖에 다른 두 개의 세상이
손가락질 해 겁쟁이라 욕 해

두 개의 이름의 나는
두 개의 삶을 살어
내 어떤 삶을 사랑하나요
두 개가 나인 나는
마음이 하나라서
당신에게 난 하날거예요

난 (난), 난 (난)
난, ooh, 난
두 개가 나인 나는
마음이 하나라서
당신에게 난 하날거예요
난

비린내 나는 그 입 좀 닥쳐봐
그게 내 몸에 밴지도 몰라
쉽게 뱉은 말은 모두 거짓말, 그렇게 거짓말
그게 사실이 돼
그럴 때 난
아무 말도 못했어
아무 것도 못했어
그래서 난

다시 현관문을 밀고 나설 때
다른 사람이 된 기분을 느껴
내 안과 밖에 다른 두 개의 세상이
손가락질 해 겁쟁이라 욕 해

두 개의 이름의 나는
두 개의 삶을 살어
내 어떤 삶을 사랑하나요
두 개가 나인 나는
마음이 하나라서
당신에게 난 하날거예요

난 (난), 난 (난)
난, ooh, 난
죽고 싶었던 나의
손목을 놓지 않은
당신에게 난 하날거예요
