He was riding a scooter that is one step up from a child's scooter; cops were stalking, else how could they have ""caught"" him (a few minutes l8er, and he would've been inside his gates/ home); it's a set-up, with Big Brother Yoongles as a scapegoat; the media posted false photos and outright LIES; Yoon-gi apologized, even though he DID NOTHING TO WARRANT ALL THIS FRENZY; Cops and Media have been misrepresenting Yoon-gi (he DESERVES AN APOLOGY!); they're dragging all this out as a cover-up for...? (and it wouldn't surprise me if ""mini gin"" keeps adding fuel to the fire...to dig in pockets of Yoon-gi/BTS, BigHit, and HYBE...anyway she can); and the media want photos of Big Brother, so that they can twist the context even more, bc they don't care abt ruining his rep and his family's good name (I hope Karma comes for them, and destroys their lives, as well as the lives of those who knew their plans and didn't try to stop them).

What is happening today, and what we are witnessing, is ""separation"" BTS from South Korea (morally, ethically, psichologically, mentally).
And it is for the best. 
Yes, every country has different people. Every country has good and bad. And in South Korea, as in other countries of the world, there are people who love BTS. 
BUT BTS is not South Korea. BTS and South Korea is not the same thing. 
And BTS does not represent South Korea, except once for a limited time when they were appointed as presidential envoys.
BTS represent only themselves.
We love, respect and trust BTS because they earned it, they deserve it.
We all know what BTS did for South Korea, and what exactly did South Korea as a country did for BTS?
South Korea took BTS achievements and success as their own, just for its own interests.
South Korea has never been BTS (""their"") country in its true sense, because it has never been mutual respect and love.
For such global celebrities as BTS and how much respect they showed South Korea, it is not enough to be born, live and work in this country, to be korean nationality and be citizens of this country to be it ""yours"".
Yes, BTS are korean, but it is just nationality, it does not define them.
We love and respect them not as koreans, but as the individuals, the human beings they are.
South Korea never respected and treasured BTS and it showed it again, and again, and again.
There are limits to everything, and in Suga's case South Korea crossed the line.
Masks are down and South Korea (as a country - government, police, media, society (part of it)) are showing its true face to the whole world.
Officially ""democratic"" country where there's no respect for human life and human rights. Where media can do everything and it's ok.
Where many people live in fear.
Even celebrities are afraid openly to support their friend because of the harassment they know they are going to face.
Where bullying and harassment are the standards of everyday life.
South Korea exports globally the concept of ""Korean beauty"", but what are they showing to the world now its ""Korean ugliness"", in political, moral, ethical sense.
BTS are strong spiritually. And materially. BTS has money, power, influence. BTS has ARMY. BTS built their own global empire.
South Korea had many opportunities to treasure BTS, to value, to respect them. BTS trully could have been the pride of South Korea.
It was like a test. And South Korea failed it. And that's why BTS (with ARMY) are going to become the downfall of South Korea.",0,2024-08-24T18:44:08Z,,0

The South Korean media has not improved actually they are targetting their own people for clicks. It is just great to see that people who made their country flourish and wellknown gets internationally support. The South Korean media gets a backlash aren't they not ashamed? SK showing the world no ethics, and caught by spreading false news. The real SK monster is their own media, who gets away by intentional creating false and fake news.( Also to say by investigation only 28% of Knetizens believe their news media.(reuters).) 

Untill this day they haven't improved their tactics and therefor humiliate their own country international, globally. Threaten and slandering the person, attacking their members, and even their family. Hate is great for their targetting smearcampaign with all fake and defamation news. The South Korean media were caught and start to threaten more even after media apologize, they threatend with more slander publications and attacks and still continue as is today. 

The celebrities who are the ambassadors of SK are not protected in a good way. They are being misused as it feels like comfortly to do by SK media to cover up for the real monsters. As suggesting ofcourse they can leave SK,  they are welcomed over the whole world and every country wants to embrace them. It is still Love over Hate.

BTS made South Korea loved as they showing  love for their country. All those millions of people who loved South Korea because of how BTS always shown their love, seems to be a great bubble.  The injustice South Korean media did on purpose to humiliate their own country globally instead of them. The BTS effect of how great SK is, that part is forever broken.

Still those monsters are continu showing of their dark side and feeling comfortly to keep on bullying and made up stories. Is their nation and their family feeling proud of them, i really wonder.
The police who violate their own laws for a photo - did not protect him or give him a safe passage. Also this is a repeat.

And they keep harassing him after that?? I saw an article of a journalist there writing that criticism will rise and it's just not going to look good for Yoongi if he doesn't look directly on the eyes or cameras of the reporters there.. like LEAVE HIM ALONE ?!!#&

Please report the heck out the accs sharing this and don’t interact!
The last thing we wanna see is Yoongi bowing cuz of the media 

I know the fact he showed up says a lot of him as a person the media are the ones who should apologize for spreading malicious lies tf

Also, why is this still an ongoing investigation?? like it's not that deep 😭 Yes, he made a mistake riding drunk a scooter but we all saw the video and he was doing it hella slow, wearing a helmet and he indeed told us the truth on his weverse post. Like why is the police and media taking this case as if he run off 50 people driving drunk in car or something?

No one is making excuses for Suga. He made a decision. He broke the law. However, this does not mean he needs to be completely and utterly destroyed and humiliated. He will live with the consequences of his decision for the rest of his life. Why is that not enough for you and others? I love my son (who is not Min Yoongi), unconditionally. That does not mean I condone the DUI he received. ARMY feels the same about Suga. Humans are not products. They are by nature imperfect, fallible, and prone to mistakes of judgment. This means we can love and support them as they make mistakes, suffer the consequences, and move forward to redeem themselves through making better choices, living a good life, and giving back to society. All of which Min Yoongi will do in the future.

While he may not have been the victim in the actual incident of diving home while intoxicated, he is most definitely a victim of Korean media and the many people who want to sit as judge, jury, and executioner after the fact. ARMY objects to the focused effort to utterly destroy Min Yoongi in ways that 99% of people are not subjected to. He has not been defiant. He has not made excuses. He has not tried to throw around his power and influence. He has humbly accepted all the consequences, apologized, and accepted all the legal consequences that have come or will be coming his way.

It doesn't hurt anyone that people support him as an artist but more importantly as a person. We all need to know that others are in our corner to support us. The degree to which Min Yoongi has been vilified by many people justifies the many people who continue to say that they love him and will stand by him. Those actions do NOT indicate justification for the crime he committed.

Yoongi - 다 괜찮아질 거야   It will all be okay   ARMY - 다 괜찮아질 거야  It will all be okay    BTS & their family and friends - 다 괜찮아질 거야  It will all be okay       We love and support you all, unconditionally.",0,2024-08-23T21:40:33Z,,0

I just finished watching ep 5 of Bon Voyage season 4 and was so touched by how the guys, exploring the world, sharing family time, on vacation, seeing such an amazing sight as the beautiful unblemished snow covered mountaintop, STILL had Army in their hearts and made tribute to us in the snow. I teared up because it shows that wherever they are, they take us with them in their hearts. It shows that we are always in their thoughts. As they are always in our thoughts and hearts. It is evident how they take care of each other, support each other and have each others backs. From Jimin putting heat packs for sleeping Yoongi , Yoongi always taking such love, care and joy in cooking and feeding them, Jin cheering on Hoseok even when he didn't catch any fish, Hoseok organizing everything and making everyone smile, Taeyung carrying the heavy water for their food to be cleaned, Jungkook doing whatever was needed or asked of him by his hyungs, and RM using his ""time off"" to work for their music, EVERTHING they do is for Family. They consider Army part of that family. And True Army, in turn, will give them the same love, passion and support they show us by ALWAYS having their backs. #ArmyFighting #ArmyForLife #Borahae 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜",0,2024-08-23T19:35:04Z,,0

noticed the smell of alcohol,

I will always support him. He didn’t break any law. He went there to apologized. To let those vultures stop 🛑 attacking him. Everything will be ok for our Yoongi.

Suga is loved and supported by many, and that will never change! There is a big difference between honest reporting and witch-huntingThe media's hands are already stained with the blood of far too many artists whose lives have been taken or destroyed by their witch-hunts, bullying and sensationalism, leaving behind a trail of shattered dreams and broken spirits. The deliberate sensationalism, lies, persecution, bullying, threats and defamation of Suga and other artists need to stop. Violating the journalistic code of conduct and ethics harms and damages the artist, the public, all reputable media organisations, and South Korea. This is a golden opportunity for the authorities and the company to set a solid precedent against unethical media, haters, and other types of harassment. Their actions can inspire change and set a positive example for others. Additionally, this is an excellent reminder for some ARMY and the public to vet and consider the sources of information and their intentions and not believe sensationalised news. 💜",6,2024-08-23T18:12:14Z,,0

Today he did show up and gave a statement, yet you're not ""showing it"" because you're on his jock and want to protect him. Maybe you could have protected him by driving his .227 drunk butt home from the bar two weeks ago. It is NOT ILLEGAL for journalists to show up to the police station, it is a public place. Stop spreading lies - there is no law stating that. That is why journalists are freely there. Stop spreading fake narrative as news. But any monkey brain would know what you're saying is false, so not a big deal - haha. Cutting down the journalists covering ""news"", when your news is just opinion, shielding information that everyone else can get by watching real media sources. Dude, you need a new job. You also need to get off Suga's jock.",1,2024-08-23T17:14:17Z,,0

As for the entire situation, yoongi should reflect and learn from this experience to lead a better more peaceful personal and professional life.  This is not the time for lambasting him,  it's already difficult times for him. Never push a person who is already down, we should be more kind and decent. The time for disappointment can be after this situation is resolved and yoongi is able to understand our perspective,  after he has recovered from this situation.",0,2024-08-23T17:13:44Z,,0

I for one will only believe an official statement from them!!!!  Media just want more photos so they can alter them to show him in a bad light… or at least d
So Antis can do that!!!!  BTS OT7 for life!!!",1,2024-08-23T17:13:31Z,,0
