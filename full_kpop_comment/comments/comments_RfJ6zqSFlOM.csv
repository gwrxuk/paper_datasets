@pdfafileforstorage2,"This choreography just barely beat out HIT for favourite Seventeen choreography.

Reasons
*1.* Obviously, the synchronization. I mean, it's Seventeen. What do you expect?? LOL
*2.* Some parts of the choreography are just absolutely creative. A relay race during Vernon's part, Wonwoo (athlete) high-fiving some of the members in line (the audience) during his second verse, Woozi running off track but DK pushes him back at the bridge of the song. All of these add to the theme behind Left & Right.
*3.* A lot of the choreography is just having fun like during Vernon's verse and Joshua's part in the final chorus. Their screams and shouts really help with that.",1,2021-02-21T04:22:01Z

@hio7816,"If someone will ask ""why this is qualified for the dance performance award when it is very easy to dance?"" , answer this:

1.) The only easy part is the first part of the chorus. The second part is hard (especially in a close formation).
2. The second part is hard but the verses are harder.
3. The making of the formations while doing those wide movements are the hardest because the movements are really wide, the formations are pretty close, and the formations changes all the time.
4. This is a very creative dance routine, the formations are on point, it really complements to the sound and lyrics of the song, and it also relay the message of the song.
5. It's easy to dance but hard to perfect (the vibe, joy, the members movements, and the whole thing.)
6. It is catchy and very difficult to pull off at the same time.
8. While the other members are not on the focus, they still have choreography to do, which is really nice. 
9. They really deserve the award.",1,2020-12-04T01:39:57Z

@verydeartomyheart,"i stan them for the last few years but i'm busy with work and just watch their latest today. always wonder, what make them so united, so in synce and so full of synergy. it is their sincerity, love and focus to their group, not themselves. if you have big family in literal meaning to stay united is not easy.people are difference and people have different ways but seventene proof again and again how devoted they are towards their team, brotherhood, music dan works. hence when we see they perform, we see as once. no one intentionally overshadow anyone. even during daily life, their brotherhood as 13 is magical. i have been in Kpop almost 20 years, and seventeen despite consist another group from another country and have their own challenges, remain intact, united, no scandal, no bad rumors, no member left. that's how special they rare.",2,2020-10-18T09:55:48Z

@ratdeul323,"Even tho this choreo doesn't require that much strength, but still they did a lot of unique things with formations like in the beginning they make a line, square and a circle. Also they added the concept of race pretty effectively like the 01:21 relay race, wonwoo doing the countdown, 02:35 when woozi gets off track but is pushed back to the lane meaning that you could screw up sometime, just get back to the right path, 00:53 seungkwan drinking probably a sports drink or booster whatever you call it, 01:43 wonu touching the hands in line could be a reference when athletes win they touch the hands of audience or other players in the line.
Basically if you see, how fun and creative this choreo is not just moves thrown together.
02:16 my personal fav step, how in smoothly they just come into that formation, wow that transition. I also love how they use levels to captivate your attention to the member they want, and the most lovely thing about this choreo is SMILEY SEVENTEEN.",1122,2020-09-29T08:02:25Z

@kimmingyu8491,"*ATTENTION CARATs!!!*

*LEFT & RIGHT MASS V0TING AND STR17MING PROJECT.*

We need to mass str17m and vote. We need to hit 45M in order to give our SEVENTEEN more wins. We are called CARATs for a reason, we make our SEVENTEEN shine.

●v0te for Seventeen on idolchamp.
*-Please use multiple devices if you have, we are losing currently.*

●please mass str17m we need to hit 45M today.
*-Use multiple accounts to str17m, I also heard it's better to use YouTube premium while you str17m. When you comment/interact with the video censor words like ""str17m"" ""str17ming"" ""vie₩s"" ""vie₩"" ""v0te"" ""v0tes"" ""v0ting"" do not use em0jis, do not use links and do not use hashtags. Make sure you're logged in onto your account. Search for ""left & right"" on Youtube and then watch the video without pausing, rewinding or fast forwarding. Also, make sure to watch it on normal speed and 480p-720p quality. Make sure the volume is 50+.Do not use the replay button. Make sure your watch and search history is not on pause also do not clear your watch and search history. Do not watch the music video continuously, YouTube might consider you as a bot if you watch the mv continuously with the same account so take breaks for 10 minutes and in between those 10 minutes watch other videos on YouTube. Come back yo str17ming after 10 minutes.*

Please spread this on your social media accounts, make more CARATs join this mass v0ting and str17ming project.

Reminder-there are ""baby carats"" who ask how to vote, they're NOT CARATs. They're people from our competitor's fandom, they're trying to learn our strategy of v0ting. So please do NOT engage with them and only focus on SEVENTEEN. 

*We worked hard now we need to work harder for our SEVENTEEN.*

If you have more questions regarding str17ming and voting then feel free to comment down below or you can dm me on Twitter or instagram. I'll try my best to help my fellow CARATs out.

I'm just a casual listener. but with seventeen, I think they're the only exception lol. i am new to this so idk what to act if i become a multi. 😂) wish me luck. 😂 and this song is a bop!!!",3,2020-07-01T15:05:00Z

@bex3577,"okay so noone asked for this but this is a list of lil things in this vid that made me smile (like a 'things you didnt see in ""insert song"" dance' video except i dont have the video editing skills so im just pointing them out in the comments 
(i put them as individuals so you can scroll to your bias' but cos theres interactions, there are repeats.
disclaimer: some of the boys have less than the others, im sorry :(( i couldn't find the same amount for everyone (they all did incredibly though!!!)

2:41 SIR IM GONNA HAVE TO ASK YOU TO PUT THAT TOUNGE BACK IN YOUR MOUTH 
2:54 vibin with coups
3:45 WHAT THE HECK HOW DO HIS LEGS DO THAT? THEY JUST FOLD LIKE THAT? IF I TRIED THAT, MINE WOULD BREAK!!!
i couldnt find many specifics for josh, but yeh, just watch him throughout it cos a)his hair is fluffy and b) he keeps flippin smirking 


 JUN
not a specific, but if you just watch jun's face throughout the whole thing, his expression changes like, every second and its my favourite thing
0:49 him n vernon pose together

sorry i couldnt find more for wonwoo :(( pls comment some if you see them!!


 WOOZI
0:25 his feet? move so fast? i kinda thought it looked like he lost his balance and was trying to get stable again but no his feet just move that fast
1:40 the way he runs is so funny fjqnkbhxnss (it looks like he nearly whacks hoshi but hoshi doesnt flinch so i think its probs just the camera angle)
1:58 makes eye contact with vernon and hoshi
2:08 the way he does this move is so cutteeee
2:55 also the way he does this one, he just looks like hes having fun hhhhh it makes me so happy

 DK

2:28 hi-fives dino
2:59 hi-fives seungkwan

1:40 vibes a lil bit with coups but isnt as hype as him
2:01 eye contact with the8
2:07 eye contact with seungkwan (makes him smile uwu)
2:23 ddjkas i thought dino was gonna kick him
2:26 hi-fives dino
3:21 jeonghan reaches out for him but he doesnt realise and sidesteps it fdjsksns (poor jeonghan (maybe not, seeing as he then shoves wonwoo))


 THE8
0:21 mingyu puts his hand on his chest during THAT move
0:48 THE8 POSE HERE MADE ME LAUGH OUT LOUD COS IT REMINDED ME OF A MEME AND I WISH I COULD PUT PHOTOS IN THIS COMMENT SO I COULD SHOW YALL WHICH MEME I MEANT BUT JUST KNOW THAT IF YOU KNOW, THEN YOURE ONE OF THE GOOD ONES
2:01 eye contact with mingyu
2:09 his lil smile uwu

 SEUNGKWAN 
0:07 why is he eating his hat dhdjskkaja
0:26 mr boo put that tounge back in your mouth

1:41 getting hype with jeonghan n coups
2:00 makes eye contact with dk
2:07 eye contact with mingyu (makes mingyu smile uwu)
2:27 does finger guns with jeonghan instead of hi-five
2:59 hi-fives dk
3:20 yeets wonwoo out of the way
3:26 jeonghan starts rubbing his cap and ends up stealing it and waving it in the air


 VERNON
0:17 i dunno why this made me laugh so hard but vernon having his arm behind his fact looks so formal to me, cos thats what the royalty in movies do when theyre bowing but its like, the opposite cos ths is a kinda casual song
0:42 djsdhdjds he walks with such purpose
0:49 him n jun pose together
1:28 verkwan hi-five
1:58 makes eye contact with woozi and dino
2:50 idk how to explain this but HES JUST SO FLIPPIN CUTE
2:58 him n jun messing around
3:43 thinks the8 is gonna help him up and then he doesnt and kinda tries to play it off (if youre gonna watch someone that isnt your bias then pls watch this, its so flippin funny)


 DINO
dinos hair gets an honorary mention and comes in second place for floofiest and bounciest (after josh's) because just l o o k at it goooo
1:08 HES SO CUTE LOOK AT HOW HE DOES THIS MOVE
1:26 THIS BOYS DUALITY OOF, ONE SECOND HES ALL HAPPY AND SMILEY AND THE NEXT HES SERIOUS AND TRYING TO GIVE E A HEART ATTACK
1:38 his lil vibe to 'yeh yeh yehhhh' is so adorable oof
1:59 makes eye contact with wonwoo and vernon
2:07 makes eye contact with dk (i think) and they both kinda personalise the move? idk how to describe it but its cute so im putting it in
2:26 hi-fives mingyu
2:28 hi-fives dk
2:53 pokes the8 in the tummy
just in general, dino puts his literal everything into every single move and i love him so muchhh, i hope he knows how grateful we all are for how hard he works (i hope all of them do tbh, it just stood out with dino in this vid, cos every single line was accented and stuff)


 ALL/MULTI
0:21 not really subtle seeing as its part of the choreo but THE BODY ROLLS ARE SO RUDE OOF
0:32 THAT move is also rude, smh, how do they expect us to stream left n right if theyre trying to kill us
0:49 all their poses are so cute uwu
1:16 their lil ayyysss uwu
1:47 the boys on the left turning around to face the wall always makes me giggle even tho its part of the choreo 
2:50 all the boys look adorable doing this move, but especially the line furthest to the right (dino, the8, vernon)
2:58 watch them all individually, theyre so silly jlbdwkhq
3:10 again, its part of the choreo but the end 'hana dul set net dul dul set net set dul' etc,, is my fav part of this whole choreo so im putting it in

SEVENTEEN earned a lot more fans during this comeback because of the vibe they give off and it showed the newcomers their personalities and that they truly love doing what they're doing. so yeah, this is 100% my favorite comeback yet.

during vernon's rap verse, he passed the baton to minghao by highfiving him. the last runner of the relay was joshua and woozi was the hurdle. at the same time, thoe other boys can be seen supporting the runner. you could tell the team won the race when vernon raised joshua's arm.

this information was not important to me but i think this story adds depth to the whole choreography and it's so beautiful. in conclusion, seventeen best artists. seventeen world domination.

@wafiqilman5182,"SEVENTEEN berhasil memecahkan rekor mereka sendiri dengan penjualan album barunya.

Hanya dalam waktu 4 hari sejak dirilis pada 22 Juni 2020 lalu, mini album ‘Heng:garæ’ sudah berhasil memecahkan rekor penjualan album SEVENTEEN dalam seminggu.

 

Menurut data dari Hanteo Chart, mini album ‘Heng:garæ’ berhasil terjual sebanyak 895.230 keping pada 25 Juni 2020 atau empat hari setelah dirilis.

Angka tersebut berhasil melampaui rekor penjualan album ‘An Ode’ yang pada tahun 2019 lalu berhasil terjual sebanyak 700.863 keping dalam waktu seminggu.

Karena baru empat hari sejak dirilis, maka kemungkinan besar mini album ‘Heng:garæ’ akan mendapatkan angka penjualan yang lebih tinggi di minggu pertama rilis.

‘Heng:garæ’ juga menjadi album kedua yang mendapatkan penjualan tertinggi pada minggu pertama di tahun 2020, tepat di bawah album ‘Map of the Soul: 7’ milik BTS.
