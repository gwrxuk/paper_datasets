@달수호,"희미해지는 너의 기억에
색을 입혀 덧칠하고 있어
나의 세상이 너로 물들어간 것처럼
눈앞에 환히 펼쳐져야 해
네 숨소리도 네 웃음까지도
널 그려내 다 그려내
내 삶 속에

스며든 널 찾아내
어느새 나도 모르게
그날의 널 완벽히 그려내
그리곤 계속 반복해
그 안에 내가 있기에
흘러가는 시간 속에
머물러줘 이대로
There's no meaning without you
There's no meaning without you

모든 색이 엉킨 것처럼
까맣게 변해가는 걸 느껴
너 없는 창밖의 풍경엔
여백이 되어버린 추억들뿐이야
내 숨 속에도 내 눈물 속에도

스며든 널 찾아내
어느새 나도 모르게
그날의 널 완벽히 그려내
그리곤 계속 반복해
그 안에 내가 있기에
흘러가는 시간 속에
머물러줘 지금 이대로

Can't let you go
너를 놓아줄 수가 없어 난
Can't let you go
이미 너로 채워버려서
Back to the start
모든 것은 다 변하겠지만
내 안에 이대로
널 모두 담아낼 테니까


모든 것이 선명해
내 안에 네가 있기에
너로 가득했던 날 그려내
그리곤 계속 반복해
여기엔 네가 없기에
눈부셨던 예전처럼
돌아와 줘 그때로
There's no meaning without you

색을 입혀 덧칠하고 있어
나의 세상이 너로 물들어간 것처럼
눈앞에 환히 펼쳐져야 해

널 그려내 wow oh wow 다 그려내 wow oh wow

그리곤 계속 반복해 (반복해)

흘러가는 시간 속에
머물러줘 이대로

There's no meaning without you
There's no meaning without you

모든 색이 엉킨 것처럼
까맣게 변해가는 걸 느껴 oh oh oh
너 없는 창밖의 풍경엔
여백이 되어버린 추억들뿐이야

내 숨 속에도 내 눈물 속에도

스며든 널 찾아내 (찾아내)
어느새 나도 모르게 (모르게)
그날의 널 완벽히 그려내
그리곤 계속 반복해 (반복해)
그 안에 내가 있기에 whoa
흘러가는 시간 속에
머물러줘 지금 이대로

Can't let you go
너를 놓아줄 수가 없어 난
Can't let you go
이미 너로 채워버려서
Back to the start
모든 것은 다 변하겠지만
내 안에 이대로
널 모두 담아낼 테니까

모든 것이 선명해 (선명해)
내 안에 네가 있기에 (네가 있기에)
너로 가득했던 날 그려내
그리곤 계속 반복해 (반복해)
여기엔 네가 없기에 whoa

돌아와 줘 그때로 (그때로)

@Cp-gx6gh,"English Lyrics 

I'm painting over with colours on my memory of you
That's fading away
Just like my world was coloured with you
It has to unfold brightly in front of my eyes
The sound of your breaths and your laughs
I draw you wo o wo 
draw everything wo o wo
Into my life
I find you who's seeped into me
Suddenly without me realising
I draw out you from that day perfectly
And keep repeating
Because I exist in there
In the time that passes
Please stay like this
There's no meaning without you
There's no meaning without you
Just like every colour got tangled together
I feel it turning into black
In the scenery outside of the window without you
Is just memories that became a blank
In my breaths and in my tears
I find you who's seeped into me
Suddenly without me realising
I draw out you from that day perfectly
And keep repeating
Because I exist in there
In the time that passes
Please stay like this
Can't let you go
I can't let go of you
Can't let you go
Because I've already filled with you
Back to the start
Because everything will change
But I will contain all of you
In me like this
Everything is clear
Because you exist in me
I draw the me who were full of you
And keep repeating
Because you don't exist here
Please come back to back
Then when it was bright
There's no meaning without you
There's no meaning without you",159,2021-09-01T11:01:29Z

@katrinaexo-llostinexoplane969,I wonder how come EXO-L always praise Suho for being a good leader? I am not complaining but can we praise Suho as an artist? I can't pick between the 3 main vocalists in EXO now I am starting to wonder how come Suho is not a main vocalist as well. It is only in EXO that I dont trust myself when it comes to bias. Everyone is bias wrecker!!!,0,2021-08-17T22:54:13Z

• See mv atleast 2 3 time under 480 quality.
• Search the MV on search bar than see. If u are watching MV second time then do not use reply button(means again u have to watch by search history).
• Volume should be more than 50.
• Do not use playback speed for watching and don't clear your history. 
• Most importantly, don't skip adds.
• Watch MV without skipping.
• Do not comment word ""Stream"" while streaming the song.

I really want him to keep doing music, I LOVE IT",12,2021-05-27T16:54:21Z

희미해지는 너의 기억에

나의 세상이 너로 물들어간 것처럼

네 숨소리도 네 웃음까지도

모든 색이 엉킨 것처럼
까맣게 변해가는 걸 느껴 oh oh oh
너 없는 창밖의 풍경엔
여백이 되어버린 추억들뿐이야

스며든 널 찾아내 (찾아내)
어느새 나도 모르게 (모르게)

머물러줘 지금 이대로
Can't let you go
너를 놓아줄 수가 없어 난

@monisha3451,"I’m painting over with colours on my memory of you that’s fading away 
Just like my world was coloured with you 
It has to be unfold brightly in front of my eyes 
The sound of your breaths and your laughs 
I draw you, draw everything Into my life 
I find you who’s seeped into me 
Suddenly, without me realizing I draw out the you from that day perfectly 
And keep repeating 
Because I exist in there 
In the time that passes 
Please stay like this 
There’s no meaning without you 
There’s no meaning without you 
Just like every colour got tangled together 
I feel it turning into black 
In the scenery outside of the window without you 
Just memories that became a blank space... 

In my breaths and in my tears 
I find you who’s seeped into me 
Suddenly, without me realizing 
I draw out the you from that day perfectly And keep repeating 
Because I exist in there In the time that passes 
Please stay like this 
Can’t let you go 
I can’t let go of you 
Can’t let you go 
Because I’ve already filled with you 
Back to the start 
Because everything will change 
But I will contain all of you in me, like this Everything is clear 
Because you exist in me 
I draw the me who were full of you 
And keep repeating 
Because you don’t exist here 
Please come back to back then 
When it was bright 
There’s no meaning without you 
There’s no meaning without you ...",0,2021-01-26T08:47:03Z

@user-hd9bl8ob7c,Üzgünüm Suho ben pes ediyorum. 4 yıldır savaşıyorum ama o hiç pes etmiyor. Her saniye daha da güçleniyor. Sözümü tutamadığım için çok üzgünüm. Ben asla değerli veya güzel olamayacağım. Ben kabullendim bununla yaşamam gerek. Üzülmüyorum gerçekten hem görünmez olmak o kadar da kötü değil. Yani en azından çok konuşkan biri değilim bu yüzden göze batmıyorum. Sadece teşekkür ederim. En azından biranlığına bile olsa güzel ve değerli hissettirdiğiniz için. Sizi seviyorum. Lütfen artık gel... sensiz yapamıyorum. İyi geceler Suho...,0,2021-01-16T20:35:14Z

@Asteregemini,"I’m painting over with colours on my memory of you
That’s fading away
Just like my world was coloured with you
It has to be unfold brightly in front of my eyes
The sound of your breaths and your laughs
I draw you, draw everything
Into my life

I find you who’s seeped into me
Suddenly, without me realizing
I draw out the you from that day perfectly
And keep repeating
Because I exist in there
In the time that passes
Please stay like this

There’s no meaning without you
There’s no meaning without you

Just like every colour got tangled together
I feel it turning into black
In the scenery outside of the window without you
Just memories that became a blank space

In my breaths and in my tears

I find you who’s seeped into me
Suddenly, without me realizing
I draw out the you from that day perfectly
And keep repeating
Because I exist in there
In the time that passes
Please stay like this

Can’t let you go
I can’t let go of you
Can’t let you go
Because I’ve already filled with you
Back to the start
Because everything will change
But I will contain
All of you in me, like this

Everything is clear
Because you exist in me
I draw the me who were full of you
And keep repeating
Because you don’t exist here
Please come back to back then
When it was bright

@khanhngocle186,"Knowing EXO so many years ago when they debuted for the first time with MAMA as well as listening to many OSTs sang by EXO members, but that's it, I'm not interested in them too much but I really like Chen's voice. When it comes to the pandemic and I was so bored at home to search find fun stuff to watch on Youtube, I saw some clips from EXO members, They are so fun and cute just like my stan SJ, so I look up more, all info about them. Sehunnie is the person who catches my eyes, and he is my bias in EXO, but Suho's voice just captures my heart. I love all his songs in this alb. It's just so awesome. I really feel healed and touched when listening to his songs, it really makes me think about myself, think about the time I'm going through rn while living abroad. I can't express how much I love his alb and at that time, I even wonder why I just love him when his enlistment day was almost next week. So sad so pity for meee! Idk if I'm right or wrong but I can feel his loneliness expressed in this alb, his stress his burden. But I'm happy because at least he expressed it and a new unique color that only belongs to him! Just hope that he will be back happily after finishing his enlistment. 
Hi Jun Myeon Oppa, maybe you will never see my comment, but I just hope that you would not put too much on your back, take it easy, Oppa (you once shared the first thing you did in the morning after waking up was checking your phone to see if any scandals happened EXO, I mean I felt so sad when I heard that). You are a great leader now so now just put yourself in the first place more, do whatever you want Oppa. I wish you could date someone who can share the burden with you and fill out your empty! Everyone will cheer up for you and for sure, I'll be the first one hehe. Can't wait to see you until next year and more new color from you in the future. Hwaiting, Junmyeon oppa!!!",14,2020-12-06T07:56:51Z

@b1llie,"the past week has been pretty tough. i've been convincing myself i'm fine tho, and i told everyone i was good. today i burst into tears twice and immediately forced myself to stop. it's almost 6am and i've just been stressing all night, on the verge of a breakdown. i told everyone i'd sleep early for once to once again fail them (my health has been a big issue lately and thats what made me cry today too). even just seeing my youtube recommendations was freaking me out and had me so stressed. i was going through my youtube history to try and find a song to calm myself down, and i saw all the live sessions of suho's self-portrait album. the second i saw this song (my fav) i clicked and ohmygod it feels like someone just took 10kg's worth of burden off my shoulders. just hearing a calming song sang in his angelic voice, with the amazing and talented band performing instantly calmed me down. i'm still scared for the day ahead but this makes me feel better. nothing can ever replace how the exo members make me feel. just hearing Suho immediately makes me think of comfort and feeling safe. god bless these people for making such amazing music that helps so so many people so much. to anyone else who's struggling, this'll eventually pass too. the exo-eri fam have got your back :)",2,2020-11-25T00:53:28Z

That's fading away
Just like my world was coloured with you
It has to unfold brightly in front of my eyes
 
The sound of your breaths and your laughs
I draw you, draw everything
Into my life
 
I find you who's seeped into me
Suddenly without me realising
I draw out you from that day perfectly
And keep repeating
Because I exist in there
In the time that passes
Please stay like this
 
There's no meaning without you
There's no meaning without you
 
Just like every colour got tangled together
I feel it turning into black
In the scenery outside of the window without you
Is just memories that became a blank
 
In my breaths and in my tears
 
I find you who's seeped into me
Suddenly without me realising
I draw out you from that day perfectly
And keep repeating
Because I exist in there
In the time that passes
Please stay like this
 
Can't let you go
I can't let go of you
Can't let you go
Because I've already filled with you
Back to the start
Because everything will change
But I will contain all of you
In me like this
 
Everything is clear
Because you exist in me
I draw the me who were full of you
And keep repeating
Because you don't exist here
Please come back to back
Then when it was bright

                                               said by KIM JUNMYEON
   our exo-ls listen this well even though we do not like to believe, the truth is that the spirit we had earlier is showing a drop now. (i am not blaming instead motivating, there are so many exols who is more active and working for the success of our exo than i do. i really appreciate them). i love exo very much so i want to see them win and see them happy. And do you know what is their best happiness it is none other than WE EXO-LS. so it is our duty to support them while being happy listening to their masterpieces... 
new EXO COMEBACK is to be released by this december and KIM JONGINs new solo album by end of august or begin of september so shall we try our best this time(best means more than what we can do). shall we get together as one and try this time to make our kings proud. Until that go stream obsession and SUHO ALBUM SELF PORTRAIT and BAEKHYUN ALBUM DELIGHT and give these the most viewed MVs ever in kpop history, sehun and chanyeols album billion views and give it a billion views before FEBRUARY. you can watch other MVs of exo too no harm if you can do that it will be more great . 

anyways we have to just work hard a bit than we did and make a new history of kpop in the name of EXO!!!

@Fireflyco-hs7dv,Yes. I agree with you. For me seeing things like this hurts alot.   At the very place they deserve alot . And when we have everything to talk about them and be proud of it I don't understand why exo-l's are not taking it serious. Each and every exo member is talented. No one can doubt it because it is a known fact. Honestly saying currently other groups have a strong fandoms than ours. If you check in properly no one can come and compete with Exo's talents. Exo-L seriously needs to open their eyes.😕😕😕. Exo love us alot . And they never forced us by any means. In their hearts they surely do have hopes. And it's us who could help them. As long as they are happy and achieve success we are happy. That's the truth. Seeing them smiling will ease our stress and bad days. If this is how it's going to continue Exo-L should be dissapointed for themselves and not blame or make reasons by pointing the hands to Exo. 😔😔😔,0,2020-08-23T17:56:57Z
@Fireflyco-hs7dv,"""There is no me without you "". That's what our precious leader is saying to us Exo-L. Wake up Exo-L please. Don't lay back . We should support them by all means. That's how we can be happy .and how they can be happy.",1,2020-08-23T17:56:49Z

@norlinsunga1504,"The last time I fell in love with an album was with Ronan Keating's 1st album. 

This is Junmyeon's 1st solo album and trust me, what he envisioned the album to be, is what the album came out to be. He is into the arts and so he wanted his solo act to be one.

Every song, meticulously curated. 
Lyrics, carefully crafted. 
It's a self-love project with unlimited love to give.

Even the MVs, the live sessions are parallel to the story he wants to tell.

You so quickly became my favorite EXO member...I discover we are the same star sign (😂) same blood type (😂), have many of the same views in life and values, and like the same kind of music...so that way you became my idol and role model because I could finally see someone who made me so happy! and someone I could relate too. So this debut really means a lot, because I want to see all your colors and see all your dreams come to life. I can see the artist in you, through your solo debut even more. By the time you finish your services, I would have already graduated high school...It's really scary to me.

@coollulua,"I’m painting over with colours on my memory of you
That’s fading away
Just like my world was coloured with you
It has to be unfold brightly in front of my eyes
The sound of your breaths and your laughs
I draw you, draw everything
Into my life
I find you who’s seeped into me
Suddenly, without me realizing
I draw out the you from that day perfectly
And keep repeating
Because I exist in there
In the time that passes
Please stay like this
There’s no meaning without you
There’s no meaning without you
Just like every colour got tangled together
I feel it turning into black
In the scenery outside of the window without you
Just memories that became a blank space
In my breaths and in my tears
I find you who’s seeped into me
Suddenly, without me realizing
I draw out the you from that day perfectly
And keep repeating
Because I exist in there
In the time that passes
Please stay like this
Can’t let you go
I can’t let go of you
Can’t let you go
Because I’ve already filled with you
Back to the start
Because everything will change
But I will contain
All of you in me, like this
Everything is clear
Because you exist in me
I draw the me who were full of you
And keep repeating
Because you don’t exist here
Please come back to back then
When it was bright
There’s no meaning without you
There’s no meaning without you

@shushuS2,"희미해지는 너의 기억에
색을 입혀 덧칠하고 있어
나의 세상이 너로 물들어간 것처럼
눈앞에 환히 펼쳐져야 해

네 숨소리도 네 웃음까지도
널 그려내 다 그려내
내 삶 속에

스며든 널 찾아내
어느새 나도 모르게
그날의 널 완벽히 그려내
그리곤 계속 반복해
그 안에 내가 있기에
흘러가는 시간 속에
머물러줘 이대로

There's no meaning without you
There's no meaning without you

모든 색이 엉킨 것처럼
까맣게 변해가는 걸 느껴
너 없는 창밖의 풍경엔
여백이 되어버린 추억들뿐이야

내 숨 속에도 내 눈물 속에도

스며든 널 찾아내
어느새 나도 모르게
그날의 널 완벽히 그려내
그리곤 계속 반복해
그 안에 내가 있기에
흘러가는 시간 속에
머물러줘 지금 이대로

Can't let you go
너를 놓아줄 수가 없어 난
Can't let you go
이미 너로 채워버려서
Back to the start
모든 것은 다 변하겠지만
내 안에 이대로
널 모두 담아낼 테니까

모든 것이 선명해
내 안에 네가 있기에
너로 가득했던 날 그려내
그리곤 계속 반복해
여기엔 네가 없기에
눈부셨던 예전처럼
돌아와 줘 그때로

@디오옹-s3h,"자화상  가사

희미해지는 너의 기억에
색을 입혀 덧칠하고 있어
나의 세상이 너로 물들어간 것처럼
눈앞에 환히 펼쳐져야 해

네 숨소리도 네 웃음까지도
널 그려내 다 그려내
내 삶 속에

스며든 널 찾아내
어느새 나도 모르게
그날의 널 완벽히 그려내
그리곤 계속 반복해
그 안에 내가 있기에
흘러가는 시간 속에
머물러줘 이대로

There's no meaning without you
There's no meaning without you

모든 색이 엉킨 것처럼
까맣게 변해가는 걸 느껴
너 없는 창밖의 풍경엔
여백이 되어버린 추억들뿐이야

내 숨 속에도 내 눈물 속에도

스며든 널 찾아내
어느새 나도 모르게
그날의 널 완벽히 그려내
그리곤 계속 반복해
그 안에 내가 있기에
흘러가는 시간 속에
머물러줘 지금 이대로

Can't let you go
너를 놓아줄 수가 없어 난
Can't let you go
이미 너로 채워버려서
Back to the start
모든 것은 다 변하겠지만
내 안에 이대로
널 모두 담아낼 테니까

모든 것이 선명해
내 안에 네가 있기에
너로 가득했던 날 그려내
그리곤 계속 반복해
여기엔 네가 없기에
눈부셨던 예전처럼
돌아와 줘 그때로

@maichennie8797,"ENGLISH LYRICS:

I’m painting over with colours on my memory of you that’s fading away

 Just like my world was coloured with you It has to be unfold brightly in front of my eyes 

The sound of your breaths and your laughs I draw you, draw everything Into my life
 I find you who’s seeped into me 

Suddenly, without me realizing I draw out the you from that day perfectly And keep repeating 

Because I exist in there In the time that passes 

Please stay like this 

There’s no meaning without you There’s no meaning without you 

Just like every colour got tangled together I feel it turning into black In the scenery outside of the window without you 

Just memories that became a blank space 

In my breaths and in my tears I find you who’s seeped into me

 Suddenly, without me realizing I draw out the you from that day perfectly And keep repeating

 Because I exist in there In the time that passes 
Please stay like this 

Can’t let you go I can’t let go of you Can’t let you go 
Because I’ve already filled with you Back to the start 
Because everything will change But I will contain all of you in me, like this 

Everything is clear 
Because you exist in me I draw the me who were full of you
 And keep repeating

 Because you don’t exist here
 Please come back to back then When it was bright 

There’s no meaning without you There’s no meaning without you..",296,2020-04-08T13:36:50Z

@nurfarihaeha4513,"when first I saw the teaser i said "" this is not a normal solo album "" and when i first time heard to all the songs i thought ""this is art."" This is the songs (whole album) that suho show his real talent,real exspression,what he feels about himself for 8 years ago until now. Honestly,I think to myself as exol didnt deserve to this kind of album or music. its sooo......

without him,  everything will not be like now. tq suho..for being a good leader for all exo members, be a good leader n idol for all exol. we love u.

@름이-v4z,"희미해지는 너의 기억에
색을 입혀 덧칠하고 있어
나의 세상이 너로 물들어간 것처럼
눈앞에 환히 펼쳐져야 해

네 숨소리도 네 웃음까지도
널 그려내 다 그려내
내 삶 속에

스며든 널 찾아내
어느새 나도 모르게
그날의 널 완벽히 그려내
그리곤 계속 반복해
그 안에 내가 있기에
흘러가는 시간 속에
머물러줘 이대로

There's no meaning without you
There's no meaning without you

모든 색이 엉킨 것처럼
까맣게 변해가는 걸 느껴
너 없는 창밖의 풍경엔
여백이 되어버린 추억들뿐이야

내 숨 속에도 내 눈물 속에도

스며든 널 찾아내
어느새 나도 모르게
그날의 널 완벽히 그려내
그리곤 계속 반복해
그 안에 내가 있기에
흘러가는 시간 속에
머물러줘 지금 이대로

Can't let you go
너를 놓아줄 수가 없어 난
Can't let you go
이미 너로 채워버려서
Back to the start
모든 것은 다 변하겠지만
내 안에 이대로
널 모두 담아낼 테니까

모든 것이 선명해
내 안에 네가 있기에
너로 가득했던 날 그려내
그리곤 계속 반복해
여기엔 네가 없기에
눈부셨던 예전처럼
돌아와 줘 그때로
