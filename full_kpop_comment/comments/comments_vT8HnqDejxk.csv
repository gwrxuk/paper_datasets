@yenyurrea5492,"This episode left me very delighted with Jisung and helped me see a little of his personality, you can tell that he is someone very sensitive and considerate and that he really tries hard. also His smile is very tender and I really identify with him a lot in not knowing how to cook, perhaps since a year has passed since this video I'm sure he has improved a little. at least he shows more willingness to learn that me 😂.

I loved when Taeyong used to pick him up to annoy Doyoung, Taeyong is really a menace. and i loved how considerate and patient doyoung was with jisung even if he was very stressed and rushed Because of the little progress they had and that they were running out of time, that really means a lot. 


Finally Jungwoo shined, very good mc, very funny and a clear threat to Jisung and Doyoung's team, he and Taeil literally already had me stressed but at the same time letting out a lot of laughter when Penalties were applied, especially on Doyoung and Jisung's team since they kept their kitchen very dirty because of how focused they were. 😂😂😂",1,2023-10-15T23:33:54Z

@mirawoo,"Wow, there are so many people compliments Jungwoo antics for being funny, but there are still hurtful comments about Jungwoo too.. Like chill guys, this is all for fun.. the member fine with it since they know how Jungwoo is on camera.. 

Like seriously, Doyoung and Jungwoo literally like brothers who always together off camera.. And Jisung is pure boys that is kind to all his hyung despite being pressure left and right.. And it's not only Jungwoo who pressure him, other hyungs also doing the same or are we not watching the same video.. 

Both mc really do a good job, and even though they jokes a lot, they also helping Doyoung and Jisung team too.. And if you want this content to be serious for cooking only without the penalties etc, the staff would have invite members that could actually cook instead.. They want it to be chaotic as they prepare that penalty stuff..

If you guys don't like, just don't watch, why the need to spend your time to wrote hate comments.. And Jungwoo been in a lot of NCT content, because he literally close with all members and can bring their mood up so there's no awkwardness surrounding the air during filming.. Members also said he brighten the teams up and adores him.. that's why staff like him too..",0,2022-11-02T14:35:24Z

@lemylinh9536,"But this (amongst other NCT's contents as well) makes it obvious why Taeyong is a truly good leader material. He is always considerate, thoughtful, humble and observative. He gives reasons for Yuta being said to be a bit upset, though they could have just let it pass as a joke among themselves which made the content funnier. He asked to prepare the shrimps for Yuta who could not touch the raw shrimp. He takes care of the maknae with spooning Jisung a mouthful taste. He patiently guides Yuta who obviously has no interests in cooking through the episode. To be honest previously when I was not this into NCT yet I thought he would be the cold, arrogant type of guy who knew that he was hot and handsome and stuffs. But it was proven that I was wrong, and personally that made me appreciate him even more for having to put up with others' stereotypes that are not correct about him at all.",34,2022-05-22T21:47:33Z

You could tell Jisung was getting overwhelmed and they weren't giving him a break with the penalties. Like the cooking contest in Dream they were all lax with Jisung.

Taeyong and Doyoung are probably one of the best combo, bickering yet syncing with the whole netflix thing.
I really love how Jungwoo has such a nice sense of humor, he literally brightens up any NCT content he's in, and seeing Taeil all smily and excited makes me SO HAPPY.
And ofcourse, it's always a pleasure seeing our maknae blend in so well with the hyungs, he's really growing up well.

I don't really like it when he's on the jury, he's never fair, especially when it comes to Doyoung. Doyoung is too good with him so he often underestimates him and defiant looks once this is not the first time because it was the same before when he was a model judge. He wants Taeyong's attention by praising and scaring his words while belittling Doyoung when Doyoung and Taeyong are competing. His cocky attitude is worse than Haechan",0,2022-04-22T20:00:53Z

@jopocky4361,"너무 네오해…이건 기록을 남겨야한다. 5:30 부터 우당탕쿵탕엉망진창 스파클링 카오스 시작 

1. 솔까 잘못한것도 없는…시키는 대로 하는 동손들에게 페널티 주고 싶어서 안달난 깜찍이허접 엠씨들이 얼레벌레 재료뺏기 시킴

2. 진행자들이 뭐라하건…본인 갈 길 가던 유타에게 태용이 탄산수(스파클링) 루팡 지시. 

3. 무릎꿇고 사과한다는 지성아…너는 잘못한게 단 하나도 없단다… 

4. 스파클링을 돌려받고 싶다면 김도영 너가 아양을 좀 떨어봐라~ 하는 이태용…시작부터 큰 그림을 그리고 있었음…

5. 근데 전달오류. 유타가 지시 받은대로  “스파클링 먹고싶음 춤춰.” 하니까 거의 자동반사처럼 강아지가 튀어나와서 [이쁜짓] 실시! 탄산수도 탄산수지만 그것보다 뽐을 보여줄 자리가 있으면 절대 놓치지 않는 강아지답다! 탄산수 주세요💓

6. 그걸 보고도 만족하지 못한 티와이. 반드시 베프의 춤사위를 보겠다는 의지로 다시 김도영 소환. 

7. 엔시티 리더의 큰그림을 눈치채고 진행자답게 “도영씨 스파클링 댄스(언제부터 벌칙이었음?) 갑니다!!!” 를 외치는 금손 문선생…그 옆에 이쁜짓 하는 와중에 밀려났는데도 기죽지 않고 더 신나버린 강아지. 

8. 도놀모 당한 짬밥이 있지…여기 말려들면 망한다는 걸 아는 김도영씨 안 나감. 

9. 티와이의 큰그림이 무너진다…! 더 밀어붙이기 위해 스파클링 먹어 없애버린다는 강수를 두었다! 그렇지만 침착함을 잃지않는 도영이. 칭찬해~

10. 그리고 아무도 안 시켰는데 행복하게 벌칙댄스여야 했던 스파클링 댄스를 선보이는 강아지. 스포트라이트를 받아서 행복하다! 

11. 열받은 도영이와 약올리는 태용이 사이에서 터지는 지성이 등…유타형한테 막말하게 생김. 근데 유타의 등은 안 터짐. 왜냐? 태용이 말에만 집중하느라 못 들음. (집중력 최고…엠씨들이 춤추건 싸우건 1도 관심 안 줌….) 졸지에 아무도 데미지 받지않은 공격을 해버리고 평소보다 백배 머쓱해진 지성이;;; 

12. 김도영이 도발에 걸려들지 않자 진행자들 심기를
거슬렸다는 이유로 페널티 받음. 그 사이에서 누구 등? 지성이 등 팡팡 터짐. 

(그렇지만 지성이는 괜찮을겁니다…그냥 순간순간 곤란할뿐이지 본인이 요리를 완성시키는 게 제일 중요해보이거든요) 


결론: 치열한 심리전과 얼레벌레와 끼부림과 성실함이 합쳐져 완성되는 2분간의 우당탕쿵당 하모니! 

번외: 그렇게 싸워대다가 8:17초에 애플민트
모르는 지성이를 놓고 꺄르륵!! 넷플릭스래🌟💓✨ 하고 쿵짝 맞게 노는 베스트 프렌드. 역시 이 둘 싸움은 칼로 불 베기랍니다. 물 아니고 불.

@nadya7285,"What I learn from this episode :
- Taeyong should be the MC of Awsaz 🤣 He did so well, steal doyoung's role and his walkie-talkie, he know how to make the contents fun!
- Jungwoo and Taeil have a great chemistry and totally an entertainer material, know how to make things funny with that repeated penalty and how they made jisung panic! (We all hoping NCT would go to TV Variety Show more often... We need everyone to know that they're so funny and really chaos when they're ""comfortable"")
- Yuta casually throwing a joke with his ""scary"" face (Deeply inside, we all know he's not scary, but Jungwoo and Taeil said Yuta scared them 🥲)
- Doyoung is an excellent multitasker! How can he answer Taeil that fluent while he only has 5 minutes to help Jisung?? I mean I would be really panic if it's me.
- Jisung really love his hyungdeul, he don't want to hurt them 😭
- Also, nothing beat DoTae chemistry! That Netflix thing is so funny... Literal best friend, how can they think and talk about the same thing at the same time 😍",195,2022-04-22T16:26:01Z

I don't know if Jisung is ready for another recording with ilichil again he looked stressed out but was adorable managing LOL. Yuta was doing his best too.

I’m happy that Jisung and Doyoung’s dish seemed to do well too. I’m not really familiar with Scotch Egg but I wanna try it. I hope that this doesn’t discourage Jisung to go do those cooking lessons.

@gail1015,"To be honest, you can see that Jungwoo and Taeil pestered Doyoung and Jisung more because they were intimidated by Yuta, and they had to keep the show funny.  Doyoung was also starting to lose his temper at the constant penalties because Jisung was getting flustered (I think that's why Taeil helped in the cooking), but he tried to be game for the sake of the show.   D0-Ji team also didn't claim the penalty from Yuta (steal an ingredient - they could have taken the ice cream) but on the other hand, Taeyong insisted on stealing the sparkling water and even wanted Doyoung to dance.  Doyoung refused pointblank, which was a clear sign he wasn't happy anymore.  Still, overall, very happy that Doyoung got to do this with Jisung.  It showed how close they are, and what a great person Doyoung is.",119,2022-04-22T14:29:31Z
