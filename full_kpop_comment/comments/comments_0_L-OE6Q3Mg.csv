@arianjae_,"Sebong's performances never differs. How they danced in the dance practice videos to the live performances always have the same energy and its always high. I adore this group for never being lazy in any of their performances. They give it all. They sing their heart out, they dance until their bones might break. I've never been dissatisfied with their music and their team work is amazing. When I stumbled upon their performances, no other groups (please don't take this negatively, all groups are working hard) satisfy me like how seventeen satisfies my heart.

@Lillymu961,"This choreography is so fun! Love how in sync they are and in general I just really love this song. I'm constantly impressed by SEVENTEEN. They always put out great songs and really interesting choreography. :) This is phenomenal group! :D

Also, to anyone who happens to see this, I am currently challenging myself to listen to music from all the artists nominated for MAMA 2018. I will also be making videos reviewing the different songs I came across while doing this. If you are interested in this type of content, please consider visiting my channel. I would really like to help new K-pop fans discover music from artists they may not have heard much about yet. :) Thank you for reading this comment! God bless you!!! :)",8,2018-12-02T01:42:21Z

@adrenalineliberation,Bro the visuals of this choreography is truly astonishing. They moves just flow so nicely the dance is so seamless man. I am not a dance expert or anything but ever since I started dancing myself and learning about technique and stuff I have an even bigger appreciation for their cheoros man I know how hard it is for 3 people to stay in sync but 13??? These boys really next level with this man. The whole dance felt alive it was like watching a movie ya know what I am saying? It wasn't just  them going from one move to the next the moves flowed into each other and the visuals were so big and just ugh I love this so much idk how else to say it.,0,2018-08-20T22:07:58Z

Wonwoo - signature fit,  tracksuit
Vernon- sleevelesssssssss and them Grey sweats
Coups- In shorts is an underrated aesthetic
Joshua - LA tracksuit realness
Jun - sleeveless tease
Woozi - bf that swings by to pick you up for a casual date outta nowhere
The8 j- missing a Fanny pack to be THAT dad
Dino - sleeveless. That's it. 
Hoshi - just do it in the roller rink flashback
Dk - comfy bf to wake up to
Jeonghan- soft pastel tracksuit makes him so fluffy
Mingyu - pretty boy chill
Seungkwan - the perf simple bf look

Honestly, wonwoo has prolly a lot to do with their practice outfits today
