@tashacope4663,"This is still one of my favourite choreographies of Kpop. I mean holy shit, the amount of different parts that happen at the same time is madness. Take 0:44 for example, there are so many smaller groups doing different things, and the groups change on almost every move. It’s mesmerising to watch as a whole and really interesting to see what each individual member is doing, cause it’s basically all different timings and movements from each other. Must have been so difficult to choreograph and teach, let alone learn!",641,2020-09-24T01:32:07Z

@bex3577,"alright so im not a carat (yet but i probs will be in a weeks time) but i just wanna say. this choreo and song is so beautiful that im crying. like, i dont really know whos these boys are but the emotion in their voice and the way they dance is absolutely beautiful. i dont know if this is right or if im just understanding it wrong, but from the way i see it, this song is literally just them saying we dont have the words to say thank you to our fans, there isnt a word strong enough, so thank you will have to do. 

also? the fact that hoshi (i think thats who everyone is saying choreographed it, correct me if im wrong) incorporated sign language and the formation of thx during the bridge? thats so unique and incredible and just beautiful and meaningful and im literally just sitting here in awe of this song. 

anyways, ive listened to quite a few of their songs since discovering these guys a few days ago, and their all incredible. that being said, i dont think anything will beat this one for me, it makes me cry in the best way.",37,2020-06-12T14:46:13Z

I know that the dance is really really awesome and I don't really need to know who's who to appreciate it but I do like to try to identify members whenever I watch any kpop content. now, dance practices where their faces are far/hard to see are already a challenge. but add the fact that there are 13 members, grey scale, and (I think) 3 members wearing the same hoodie? and I'm lost bro @.@ time to study more and this time I think I'll try to find out who everyone is by checking who sings what part..",2,2020-05-31T08:47:55Z

and let's talk about the ""thanks"" MV, the part in which he is dancing alone in a kind of cafeteria the fall in that ""fourth position"" in a beautiful way and the slip he makes afterwards to get to the ""souplesse"", it is SUBTLE AND PRECIOUS IT IS SIMPLY ART OMG

All svt dances incredibly well and I say with confidence that you can't choose a ""main dancer"" because they are all incredibly good, I dare say that they are the group of guys with the best dancers and choreography that the kpop industry has right now. But many times I can't stop seeing Junhui because seriously something different and special is technically seen in all the dances that makes him attractive to the eye (artistically speaking) the way his arms and legs move , their expressions, their shoulders, their neck, EVERYTHING *(look at the beautiful fourth position that he does in the minute **3:33**)* and I say this with experience I'm professional dancer and I've seen so many dancer in along time and he's so special and artistical, he's a masterpiece",237,2020-04-06T01:41:49Z

@shakya1239,Its a lie if anyone doesnt award svt the best performance award. Bec are you blind!? This is insanely beuatiful like every other choreo of theirs. They know how to use each of their members instead of hiding  them like other groups. Each member adds to the beauty of the choreo. Its beyond my imagination to even think of the hard work behind this masterpiece.,1,2020-02-16T05:44:08Z

@pie1420,"(these are just some takes from my untrained eyes, so... 🥺)
- the successions are A+++
- really graceful! bg choreos are usually sharper and bigger. but it's all polished and smooth in here
- the thing about svt is, instead of crafting the choreographies in focus of matching the beat and rhythm, they mostly base it on the lyrics. hence movements are emotion-driven and narrates storyline of its own, even astoundingly so!
- fast but smooth transition from slow-paces to fast-paced tempo",1,2020-02-01T05:13:17Z

@asyrdal4059,"Okay, I'm not even a carat (let's say YET because the way things are going that could quickly change) but this song is amazing? And I've seen some pretty amazing KPOP choreos in my short 8 or so months as a KPOP fan but this one really takes the cake.
Let me make sure I've got this straight--
- It was choreographed by a member
- FOR 13 PEOPLE BTW
- It includes freaking sign language
- AND spells words?
- And somehow it didn't win choreo of the year? 
Dude.
I don't care who you stan, be it BTS or TXT, Blackpink or TWICE, in my opinion you'd have to be blind to see this choreography isn't a gift.

@crystal110698,"I really like this choreography... Besides the sign language of ""thank you"" and the pinky promise thing, i just realised at 1:22 and 2:26, if you were to look carefully or have a camera above them, the formation spells out THX (i just realised it thanks to one of the comments). I remember crying and getting goosebumps when i first heard the song as i watched the MV when they released it. I was so touched by the lyrics and so awed by the melody. I remember feeling very thankful and proud to have them as my idols, because they always have their fans in mind... I think i should be thanking them more than them thanking me lol. It been 3 years and a little over 6 months since i started loving and supporting them, and still, i always cry when they play the ""to carats"" VCR during concerts... I go for the ones in my country of course, but the VCRs never fail to make me cry because they are always thinking about us so i feel loved and touched...(people around me would stare at me or tell me not to cry lol) I just love them so much...

@bella7962,"The choreographer for THANKS said that if you look at the choreography line during DK's part at 1:22 and 2:26, the formation shifts to spell out T H X.

He said that people must have probably missed it because they were focused on the sign language aspect of the choreography.

If you think that you can't love Seventeen any more than you already did well think again because I fell in love with them all over again after realizing that not only did they used sign language to say thank you, they spelled it out for us in their choreography too.",7425,2018-12-30T08:35:06Z

@archishasen3307,"This choreo is everything. I'm an ARMY and this is my first Seventeen dance practice video (and this is the only song I've heard) and I always had Fire and BS&T up in that position but OMG! THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL I CANNOT. Every move is so crisp and you can see, they are 13 people and they use it to their advantage quite smartly, especially during the wave formation and the bonfire formation (where other members were lying on the ground and 1 member was standing right in between them; sorry I dunno how to explain it :3) 

This choreo deserves an award istg if they don't get it...this is hands down the best choreo I have seen. This song and the choreo deserves it all 👏👏👏",24,2018-04-02T18:10:03Z

@xShamazingx,"Seventeen are honestly crazy good. They have 13 members, you'd think it would be messy and overcrowded on stage but it's not, they have flawless transitions, every single member moves cleanly and precisely and don't even get me started on the synchronisation. This choreography is a masterpiece, just when I thought Don't Wanna Cry choreo was the peak they make this perfection, when matched with the lyrics you can really feel how emotional and genuine they are. I really adore Seventeen, they are all my role models and I'm always proud of them every single day. One day they will reach the top, I'm 100% certain of that.",562,2018-03-30T17:24:54Z

seventeen's choreography is hands down the best in the pop industry, to me and a lot of other people. it flows so well, and when the performance unit choreographs their dances, they always manage to have a story behind it. the fact that they have 13 members, yet are still so in sync, is just beyond amazing. it just makes me so... moved. i can't even explain with words how much i've started to love them. they've been my ult for quite awhile now, and everytime i always get reminded of why they're my ult when i watch their videos, especially dance ones. once again, thank you seventeen.",34,2018-03-17T06:29:35Z

@WishingStar59,honestly Seventeen has one advantage compared to other groups (diehard army here lol) and that is having a lot of members. There could have been a possibility of them doing simple choreography and it crumbles because it doesn't work due to so many members. Instead they create different images and windows with their choreography which is mindblowing,18,2018-02-26T15:58:36Z

@psychepomp1732,"É tão incrível como a voz de cada um deles se destaca ao mesmo tempo que todas se encaixam 
É maravilhoso como a dança deles sempre surpreende por ser tão complexa e bem montada, além de todos a dançarem bem
A sincronia deles é tão boa que chega a ser mágico 
É uma coreografia que se encaixa perfeitamente neles
Não importa se são muitos membros todos eles são completamente importantes e totalmente necessários para que ela fique tão linda 
SEVENTEEN nunca deixa de impressionar e nunca para de deixar as CARATs cada vez mais apaixonadas 
Essa musica é tão linda que me fez chorar 
Nós CARATs que devemos agradecer pelo esforço do SEVENTEEN e por todo amor, carinho e esforço que esses garotos nos mostram
Essa música não tem só uma incrível conexão de vozes e dança entre eles mas também entre SEVENTEEN e CARATs

@irishlajara3658,"I don't know why I'm emotional, but I think it's best to say that I feel like this because I truly believe Seventeen has succeeded. Not because of the awards but because they have found people who support their songs and appreciates them for who they are as artists and individual people. I may not know them personally but it's just how it feels for me. Seeing them grow from 2013 until now has truly inspired me in so many ways. I think, maybe for the 3 minutes and 53 seconds I've listened to this song, I have not fan girl and just tried to appreciate what they have prepared for me. For us. 

I write these lengthy comments whenever I see Seventeen, because the passion they have is what I yearn to have in my own career. I want to succeed and likewise, say thank you to the people who have helped me along to way. Thank you is such a common word that we always say whenever we are grateful, but it's still one of the best things to hear from them. I know that Seventeen is a group that I can continue to support until the end, and I am happy to have found that group.",117,2018-02-11T16:58:31Z

@Topazera,"Okay, wow. Seventeen has THE most tasteful and artistic choreography in kpop right now. I love how *beautiful* they are? There isn't that toughness and edge I'm used to when a boy group is going hard. Sure it's difficult but it's also just visually stunning and modern and elegant and I just can't stop coming up with descriptors! The emotion in this really sets them apart imho, like that move @ 2:05 when the members on the floor curl into themselves? I almost teared up it's so emotive!

@astrochick6171,"One thing I love (out of many) about Seventeen's dancing is that altough they have 13 members it never looks crowded. It's easy for that to happen with so many people on a stage especially if that stage has limited space. Yet they always look well organized & it's never messy. Hoshi choreographs in such a unique way. He utilizes every member so even when they're not singing or center they still create beautiful formations, even if it's something simple & not only that but it creates a wonderful atmosphere. Our boys are the really special. I've been a carat for close to three years & I'm still amazed at how talented they are. I'm so proud to be a carat bc I'm supporting 13 people who aren't just amazing but strive to become better. Is it humanly possible? I didn't think so but they somehow always come back better than before. I'm so grateful for their hard work & I feel blessed I got to see them transform over the years. I'll continue to support Seventeen. Can't wait to see what they have in store for the future.",197,2018-02-11T01:57:32Z

They've been like this since their debut or even when they are still trainees. All of their songs are self made by them and their choreo too, with the bit of help from their Bumzu hyung and I believe Hoshi also seek advice from a noona too. A very talented and self-produce grouo indeed. I am very proud to be Seventeen's fangirl. From the way they think about their comeback songs until they perform it live on stage and from how they connected their songs from one another or from every songs they perform. A big round of applause for these hard working and talented boys. They keep on inspiring others and I am very proud of Seventeen. Good Job! 👏👏👏👏👍😊🎉",4,2018-02-11T01:42:45Z

@themaddy010,"looking at this from a professional dancers point of view their transitions (the in between moments between the steps) are incredibly clean and smooth. they also have so many different dynamics in their movement - sometimes they're soft, then sharp, then soft again. some other bg's tend to just dance hard and fast which is great, but its truly breathtaking to see svt's change in dynamics. not to mention the use of levels in their choreography - some stand whilst the others are on the floor. i understand its easier to create choreography like this with more dancers and it looks more amazing with more people, but a lot of credit goes to their actual ability. they really make me feel something when i watch them dance, the same way i feel when i watch a professional contemporary dance company or ballet company perform. i dont know who choreographed this but goddamn its truly beautiful",620,2018-02-10T23:59:28Z

@may6315,"No puedo explicar lo que siento al ver esta coreografía, ellos han hecho excelentes piezas anteriormente pero no hay nada comparado a esta, es un nuevo nivel. Expresan tanto al bailar que no hay forma en que puedas explicarlo, hay tanto sentimiento, tanta perfección y tanta fluidez que simplemente es difícil de procesar.
Amo a mis niños y amo el hecho de que siempre busquen superarse y hacer algo significativo, algo mucho mas que solo bailar para moverse, sino que lo hagan para utilizarlo como un lenguaje. Y no hay forma más bella que esta.

@WinterLake25,The thing I really love about Seventeen’s choreo is that they made use of each member beautifully. The different parts also flow into each other beautifully and you can really see how the choreo connects with the meaning of the song. Not a lot of groups are able to put out choreo that really captures meaning of the song.,0,2018-02-10T20:52:25Z

@bingobongo7335,Maybe I am romanticising too much but I am convinced they are some sort of soulmates or something like that. All 13 of them. All kpop groups can dance but they are on another level of synchronisation. Like c'mon. You need to have some special *connection* to be that in sync. Do they communicate telepathically or something? 🤔,6,2018-02-10T19:25:10Z

@aquachan2242,"I love the uniqueness in every choreo of seventeen. And I've noticed, that in many choreos they use elements of gymnastics, which I rarely find in other kpop choreos. I used to do gymnastics so I know a few elements, and I was surprised to find rather difficult elements in seventeen's choreos. Like there are jumps and turns that we had learned too, and I know how difficult they can be. It really fits seventeen's style of dancing. I just wanted to say that even if they don't do that much acrobatics like other groups, don't underestimate seventeen's choreos. They make difficult things seem easy.",0,2018-02-10T18:51:56Z

@unscrewedhorses,"Ok, Ima be that annoying girl who focuses on my bias and say where the HELL was Dino this comeback? I don’t mind that he got one line again cuz I know he’s just a rapper/subvocal and he’s not the most popular member, but they put him way in the back during his line, and he never once dances in the front/center, even though he’s a main dancer. Seriously, wth happened. They usually do a pretty good job of giving them all a few seconds to stand out, which is hard with this many members, but Dino is practically non-existent this time.",0,2018-02-10T17:25:10Z

1:10 *PPEONADIPPEONHANNN*
1:10 also bootiful formation me think it unique me loves unique 
1:16 *PPEONADIPPEONHANNN*
1:21 another bootiful formation or smth idk i like this scene
1:23 -1:28 and 2:27 -2:32  reminds me of flower petals falling or smth, aesthetically pleasing
1:35 reminds me of peacocks 
1:45 Josh jerking his head back while the others give him the spotlight is bootiful
1:48 that rapid movement 
1:55 - 2:00 favorite part02
2:14 *PPEONADIPPEONHANNN*
2:20 *PPEONADIPPEONHANNN*
2:39 -2:52 The8 nailing his part, me love
3:10 ninjas or smth
3:32 that white thing looking like a flower petal, falling down at the perfect time 

me loves, me appreciates. this shows that seventeen would sweep floors ( 0:25 , 1:01 , 1:45 , 1:48 , 1:54 , 1:55 , 2:05 , 3:26 , 3:31 , 3:35 ) and break necks ( 2:47 ) to make the best choreography. i hope their performance style will go on to become something legendary not only in kpop, but in the whole world. and i noticed that their songs have two faces : the emotional , and the fun ones and i don't think they're planning a song with a sexy face any time soon. and ughhhh choosing the right voice for the right part *PPEONADIPPEONHANNN* 
about the rap, i don't know what makes good rap, but they sound emotional enough to me. 

important question : does anyone else notice cheol's ribcage in some recent pictures? i mean if he's naturally skinny he can do what he likes, but i hope he's not starving himself intentionally or unintentionally. don't stress out too much honnei. work hard, but don't overwork yourself. eat lots, know that you're loved by many no matter what. if there's any problems remember that there'll always be a solution. this goes to every other members too. i hope someone reads this. leaving encouraging messages make me feel anxious. they might never even see this. this is really long. i shouldn't drag it out any further.",0,2018-02-10T16:33:49Z

Correct me if I'm wrong, but they are the first kpop group I knew who is like this. They have their own producer and choreographer. Not just that but all members are good at compiling/composing songs too. Plus, the bond between their fans is pretty interesting too. (i'm a fan too, i know) Keep up the good work, boys! International fans are rooting for all of you.

P.S. PLEDIS. You better take care and cherish these boys or else. Make sure you guys check up on their health physically, mentally, emotionally and other words with ""lly"" on it. I swear.",0,2018-02-10T16:01:14Z

@louloulemon40,"I know that some people like the rock band sound of SVT (like Aju-nice) more than the edm sound of SVT.  But, I really appreciate them for not sticking to a specific genre or style. The rock band sound of SVT may show off their musicality or complexity of the sounds; however, as members have said, edm sounds are great to show off their dance/choreo skills. Given the genre (KPop), it is about both - if not being about so much more.

On that note, Woozi - my boy, Hwaiting!

리더여서 부담감이 클텐데 웃어주는 승철오빠 고맙다 
윤엄마라는 별명으로 세븐틴 챙겨주는 정한오빠 고맙다
뒤에서 묵묵히 세븐틴 멤버들 챙겨주는 지수오빠 고맙다
타지에서 와서 힘들텐데 노력해주는 준휘오빠 고맙다
춤 창작하는거 어려울텐데 춤 만들어서 보여주는 순영오빠 고맙다
원우개그로 팬들과 세븐틴 분위기 띄어주는 원우오빠 고맙다
프로듀싱,작곡 등 여러가지 힘들텐데 완성도 높은 노래로 찾아와주는 지훈오빠 고맙다
허리부상으로 외로움 많이 탔을텐데 견뎌준 명호오빠 고맙다
여러 예능 출연해서 캐럿 미소짓게해주는 민규오빠 고맙다

세븐틴 영상에 찾아가주는 캐럿들 고맙다

"" 고맙다 고맙다 또 고맙다 뿐이지만 ••• "" 

세븐틴 아끼고 예쁘고 고맙다
캐럿들 아끼고 예쁘고 고맙다

고맙다라는 말이 쉬운 말은 아니지만 , 고맙다라는 말이
무의식적으로 튀어나오지만 , 고맙다라는 말이 누구에겐
힘이 되지만 , 고맙다라는 말이 누구에겐 생소하지만 

고맙다 라는 말을 한번쯤 전해봅시다 , 고맙다 ♡",2,2018-02-10T13:38:27Z

I started really like his body waves when hip hop team dance on the MV . Ofc performance team’ members are best but for this choreo I really in love with Vernon’s dance. Dont forget that Vernon was supposed charge in dance when they were trainees even tho he’s the rapper now.,2,2018-02-10T13:27:37Z

@svteen7155,Did you guys know the choreography in the pre-chorus part (1:23) is actually a korean sign language and it means 'Thanks/'고맙다' for those who are disabled in speaking and hearing? so even if they can't hear they know the song is about being thankful. They're very considerate and such inspiring human beings TT so proud of being a Carat TT,3,2018-02-10T13:15:59Z
