Seventeen in itself is such a great great gift to kpop.  Big Hits should be spending more to promote them.   They did and still do for their biases including their brother group to  that group.

Edit: OK so far I know his name is Jun?? I watched a live performance of this song and people timestamped this part and said stuff like ""Ahh Jun's part so amazing! He's so good looking"" and stuff like that. Wow. I need to know more!",14,2021-03-01T23:03:59Z
@LinnSobi,"This is the first video of Seventeen I've ever watched. I've never seen ANYTHING with them at all before. I'm a massive BTS fan so I've heard the name of their band a few times, but never really felt like looking into them yet.
But I was watching Roomie's video and this song played a few seconds and I liked what I heard, so here I am.

Already a few seconds in I started smiling widely and enjoyed what I watching. Really good! And honestly at 3:04 cried. I literally gaped and was caught of guard how much I liked that part. I had to pause and cry for a few moments and then replay that small part of the bridge over and over again. I NEED to know who that was, who was singing that part. His eyes looked into my soul and everything about it made my head spin. Amazing... Wow.

So please let me know more videos I should check out from them! I literally have no idea where to start😅

@ClaireXue,"THEORY:

When they say ""I'm like a bird not a turkey"" means that they are free spirited, graceful, and they fly. Just like how a bird flies up and down, they have their ups and downs, but in the end they fly. Just like a bird. Not a turkey as a turkey is not graceful, they gobble like crazy maniacs, and they can't fly. It's easy to kill turkeys to make a yummy thanksgiving meal, whereas you shouldn't kill birds for food. I'm talking about graceful birds.
Then after a few words, they say ""In the air!"" Which indicates that they are very successful and soar in the air. Unlike a turkey, ugh.",1,2020-12-27T18:49:55Z

@_mut2882,"흩어진 조각들이 모일 때
비로소 난 숨을 쉬어
두 개의 빛 마주할 때
서로의 내일을 밝혀

해지고 어둠이 찾아올 땐
오직 난 너의 온도를 기억해
별들이 감싸 안고 있는 곳
그곳으로 가고 있어 I’ll be there

널 내 맘에 Match 하고 싶어
동틀 때 하늘과 햇살처럼
시간과 함께 우린 닮아가
결국에 하나가 될 우릴 봐

I’m like a bird 날아갈게

오직 너의 시선 속에서
내 입술은 움직여
공허함은 서로의 표현으로
채워 의미 있게 만들어

우리만 아는 Vide
어디론가 날 이끌어
내 존재의 이유는 너야
봄 같은 미소를 짓게 해주고파

서로가 어디서 무얼 하든지
중요치 않음을 잘 알고 있지
단지 바라보는 눈빛에 끌려
이 순간 밝히게 켜놓아 스위치

Ok SO a lot of people in the comments are saying something like "" Everyone is talking about Jun and Hoshi but what about Minghao"" or ""why is no one talking about _____, yall sleeping on him"" ...........seriouslly. People are allowed to comment what they want, and yes i know im being hpicritical but no, you cant just assume that ""everyone"" is being rude to a memeber or something bc honestly its annoying to see all those comments when they're just overreacting since there actually are a lot of people commenting.

@lorieolimaevillanueva6407,"흩어진 조각들이 모일 때
비로소 난 숨을 쉬어
두 개의 빛 마주할 때
서로의 내일을 밝혀

해지고 어둠이 찾아올 땐
오직 난 너의 온도를 기억해
별들이 감싸 안고 있는 곳
그곳으로 가고 있어 I’ll be there

널 내 맘에 match 하고 싶어
동틀 때 하늘과 햇살처럼
시간과 함께 우린 닮아가
결국에 하나가 될 우릴 봐

I’m like a bird
날아갈게 네 목소리 들리는 곳 어디든지
In the air
어디서든 우리
마주하는 이순간

너의 눈에 나
나의 눈에 너
우리 안에 너
우리 안에 나

너의 눈에 나
나의 눈에 너
우리 안에 우리

눈을 맞춰
Something bursting me
Electricity
너만의 시선 속에
움직여 입술이
비어있는 우주를 메워가는 우리 둘
서로의 표현이 빛을 내며
만드는 은하수를 봐

내 존재의 이유는 너야
봄 같은 미소를 짓게 해주고파
서로가 어디서 무얼 하든지
중요치 않음을 잘 알고 있지

비로소 난 숨을 쉬어
두 개의 빛 마주할 때
서로의 내일을 밝혀

해지고 어둠이 찾아올 땐
오직 난 너의 온도를 기억해
별들이 감싸 안고 있는 곳
그곳으로 가고 있어 I’ll be there

널 내 맘에 match 하고 싶어
동틀 때 하늘과 햇살처럼
시간과 함께 우린 닮아가
결국에 하나가 될 우릴 봐

너만의 시선 속에

서로의 표현이 빛을 내며
만드는 은하수를 봐

내 존재의 이유는 너야
봄 같은 미소를 짓게 해주고파
서로가 어디서 무얼 하든지
중요치 않음을 잘 알고 있지
단지 바라보는 눈빛에 끌려
이순간 밝히게 켜놓아 스위치

널 내 맘에 match 하고 싶어

@ScribblerinPanic,"my fave unit is still not failing me... :)

hoshi - whatever this boy do is marvelous to me. i just can't fathom how his brain works for creating complex choreos and being able to teach it to either 3 or 12 members. and when all is well and done, he'll turn into a childish, noisy, crazy soonyoung. really fascinating...
dino - seriously, puberty is extra good to this boy. he's getting better and better looking as he turns to an adult. and not just physically, his talent for dancing, rapping, and singing are improving so much too. one day, this boy will surprise a lot of us...
jun - super glad he is getting more and more song lines. he deserves it, his voice has a certain allure to it. it's not strong as that of wonwoo or high as that of dk and sk but it's soothing...
the8 - i have said this is a different video but if hoshi's the god of dance, the8 is the king. enough said... :)",1,2018-04-25T11:27:37Z

@캔디-o6r,"흩어진 조각들이 모일 때
비로소 난 숨을 쉬어 
두 개의 빛 마주할 때
서로의 내일을 밝혀 

해지고 어둠이 찾아올 땐
오직 난 너의 온도를 기억해
별들이 감싸 안고 있는 곳
그곳으로 가고 있어 I’ll be there

널 내 맘에 Match 하고 싶어 
동틀 때 하늘과 햇살처럼
시간과 함께 우린 닮아가 
결국에 하나가 될 우릴 봐

I’m like a bird 날아갈게 
네 목소리 들리는 곳 어디든지
In the air 어디서든 우리
마주하는 이 순간
HIGHLIGHT

오직 너의 시선 속에서 
내 입술은 움직여
공허함은 서로의 표현으로 
채워 의미 있게 만들어
우리만 아는 Vide 
어디론가 날 이끌어

내 존재의 이유는 너야
봄 같은 미소를 짓게 해주고파
서로가 어디서 무얼 하든지
중요치 않음을 잘 알고 있지
단지 바라보는 눈빛에 끌려 
이 순간 밝히게 켜놓아 스위치

널 내 맘에 Match 하고 싶어 
동틀 때 하늘과 햇살처럼
시간과 함께 우린 닮아가 
결국에 하나가 될 우릴 봐

I’m like a bird 날아갈게 
네 목소리 들리는 곳 어디든지
In the air 어디서든 우리
마주하는 이 순간
HIGHLIGHT

Baby U 시간을 되새겨본다
간절히 꿈꿔온 시간 
점점 더 가까워져가

때론 눈물도 머금던 날들 
그만 딛고 온 발자국에 남겨
세상 어디서도 서로 믿는다면 우리
마주하는 이 순간

Seventeen is the first kpop group I've really started getting into where everyone seems to be able to do everything. Most of them sing, every single one of them is amazing at dancing and I don't know much about members not in the rap unit rapping, apart from Dino haha. Also, they're all so young!

@Nerdypigsforever,why are yall so ungrateful. Seventeen made the 13 membered version for us without us even asking. They love us and gave us something they thought we would love. They went out of their way to rearrange the song and choreograph a whole new version. Yes the performance unit deserves all the credit which is why they still gave them the most lines in the OT13 ver. Stop complaining.,5,2017-02-19T08:41:56Z

@8888funnygirl,It's so hard to be minghao biased. I want to see him so much more ): it pains my heart. I like seventeen but I really watch seventeen music videos for him (also just to keep up with new releases haha). I love him so so much. I want him to have more recognition. He's so talented and so pretty and so sweet. I want him to be more popular and get more love! AND MORE LINES!! 😩. I'm so sad about this haha. More lines and more screentime. I literally die every time there's barely any minghao time. I look for him like a hawk in music videos lol,517,2017-02-06T12:43:59Z

As I was reading the comments, I am very happy that a  lot have been praising the performance unit which we all should have been doing since their debut. The performance unit was (and I think up until now) is very underappreciated and it hurts me because these boys are so talented. It's sad that they have the least fansites among the members (except Hoshi). However, I'm happy that the number of sites, albeit small, is increasing, it goes to show that a lot of ppl really now give them the attention and love they deserve.

@reinuta,"This is coming from someone who only vaguely follows SVT whenever they have a comeback and knows very little about the members besides a handful of their names and the division into different units; I've liked all of their title songs and thought BOOMBOOM was a catchy title for all ot13. When I finally decided to check this song out after seeing it in circulation, I was shocked by how GOOD it was and how it felt like it was on a different level musically from their other tracks I've heard. I was even more SHOCKED to find out this was the Performance Unit's song, because the quality feels as if it is a Vocal Unit track (vocally, song arrangement, feel of maturity). It led me to check out the entire album, and for me it's the best song by a landslide. I guess what I'm trying to say is, I know some people crap on the Performance Unit, but they put out the BEST track on this album, and this is from a non-stan (although I think this song has definitely turned me into a fan).",2,2017-01-25T03:25:26Z

And for all those  trolls that will read this and get offended... DON'T. I have nothing but love for all of Seventeen. I slipped into the diamond life during there Seventeen project days and I've been stuck ever since. That being said, the performance team is my bias team within the group and they don't get as much love because ""all they do is dance"". Clearly from this music video and their track on the new album, all four of them can do much more. Alright now I'm done with the rant...",244,2017-01-20T13:45:44Z

@alexandrajackson6842,"its really ugly when ""carats"" always complain about the ""injustice"" line distribution dor china line.. have u all just think for a second that maybe they have less line cuz its the best for the whole group... i mean they even said that they have less line but they're always on the center so they're more glad... If they arent complaining then why SHOULD U? can we al just be thankful for svt and stop whining every fucking time, they're trying all their best for us and this is how we repay them??",11,2017-01-18T14:05:31Z

오직 난 너의 온도를 기억해
별들이 감싸 안고 있는 곳
그곳으로 가고 있어 I’ll be there

널 내 맘에 Match 하고 싶어 
동틀 때 하늘과 햇살처럼
시간과 함께 우린 닮아가

채워 의미 있게 만들어

우리만 아는 Vide 
어디론가 날 이끌어
내 존재의 이유는 너야
봄 같은 미소를 짓게 해주고파

서로가 어디서 무얼 하든지
중요치 않음을 잘 알고 있지
단지 바라보는 눈빛에 끌려 
이 순간 밝히게 켜놓아 스위치

We have a problem. There's a group called ""seventeam ph"" that copies seventeen and their logos. It might look like they are making covers, but no. Some people in Korea actually who doesn't know seventeen thinks that they are an actual group. It's been rumored that they are planning to make a lightstick. Because Pledis isn't solving this problem, we should start a hashtag or something to let them know. I really want a famous person to join so a lot of people can do that tag but... T_T

I cried bc this song is amazing, I cried bc we got to hear the voices that are usually hidden, I cried bc it was finally the performance unit's time to shine like a 17 carat. and now I'm crying even more bc they deserved this video, they deserved all these views and comments, they deserve the world and they finally got a chance to show off  and I'm so so so proud to be a Hoshi stan, a performance unit stan, and a Seventeen carat <333 20SVT is their year to shine like a diamond",6,2017-01-04T08:34:07Z

And ok hands down to the performance unit. They are a blessing and basically created almost every aspect of this song. 
Produced by Hoshi himself, with the help of Bumzu, they freaking wrote all the lyrics, choreographed it themselves...How often do you see rookies this heavily involved in their songs like this? And let's not get started on their dancing, rapping and singing skills. THEY ARE SO AMAZING I'M CRYING.

Excuse me but personnaly i think they're amazing with EVERY concept. Their concepts is to have 3 teams : Vocal unit, Hip Hop Unit and Performance unit and this allows them to experiment and honestly they can be cute, they can be cool, they can be sexy, they have songs of all  musicals genre  : ballads (say yes, don't listen), cool/hip hop/jazz song ( fronting, still lonely, chuck, rock, check in, ), sexy song fast pace ,...and now highlight), chill song (healing) catchy and sweet songs (mansae, adore u, pretty u, very nice).

He's such an amazing leader and this song was absolutely breathtaking. And Dino...I have loved him ever since I was introduced to Seventeen. He's grown so much and his charisma is deadly!

@tangerine3968,"Okay, since nobody is going to spazz and talk about my baby Minghao, I'll do it on my own:

First off: MINGHAO DAMN SON YOU'RE UPGRADING REAL FAST. You have sooooo many lines and soooo many shots of you and, really, there's no need to question your dancing skills because you've always been a really gifted dancer. YOU'RE SIZZLING HOT, BABY. I'M SO PROUD!!!

Second: MINGHAO'S DIRTY BLONDE HAIR PRETTY MUCH CONFIRMED HIS HIDDEN SLYTHERIN-DRACO MALFOY VIBES. THE STRIPED DARK SUIT, THE BROOCH ON HIS CHEST, THEM EAR PIERCINGS, THE NECKTIE, THE BLACK RIPPED JEANS, THE SLEEK BLACK SHOES. EVEN ON HIS SOLO SHOTS THE ROLLED-UP SLEEVES DID JUSTICE TO HIS SLYTHERIN VIBE. EVERYTHING ABOUT HIS LOOK EMPHASIZED THE SLYTHERIN-NESS I'VE ALWAYS SEEN IN MINGHAO YAS YAS YAS.

Third: MINGHAO HAS SO MUCH LINES OMFGGGGGG I saw a decent line distribution video of this MV and it seems that Minghao was the one who sung the autotuned parts in all 3 choruses and I'm convinced because he was the only one out of the boys who lipsynced to those autotuned parts ;u;

Fourth: DID YOU SEE MINGHAO'S SLIGHT B-BOYING MOVES AT 3:18??? AND HIS MULTIPLE SPIN AT 2:18??? Those parts were so dang COOL, they're so Minghao and they suit the MV so much, I'm so pprrrooouuudd!

Fifth: I LIVE FOR MINGHAO'S SOLO SHOTS IN THIS MV. HE'S JUST SO HOT, I CANNOT DEAL. The ""I'm like a bird"" part with the wings were dramatic af but daaaamn Minghao, my love, YOU DID GREAT! YOU'RE THE HOTTEST!

And finally, I'm just so so so so so proud of the whole Performance Unit! This song is my ultimate fave from Going Seventeen album and my ultimate fave out of all Performance Unit songs, and I'm so happy Highlight is Performance Unit's song! The whole MV suits the boys so much, it suits the hype of the song so much, it's such a lovely lovely New Year present for the fans (especially Minghao fans like me ehehe). I hope this MV will receive the hype it deserves because Performance Unit should not be slept on! 
These talented boys should not be slept on, guys!!!!!",190,2016-12-31T23:50:25Z

@lizhizhi,"out of all the units, i feel like dino and hoshi have the most potential going solo, but that's just my opinion

i mean dino can sing, dance, and rap, he has incredible room to grow, there's just so much potential. plus i think he's got a lot of stage presence, so that's not a problem. problem is, he's still incredibly young so yeah

hoshi can sing and dance, idk about rapping, but you don't always need rap in songs, besides he can learn. also he can definitely hold his own with all his charisma and stage presence, and he's funny on shows and stuff. out if all the members he has most potential right now to go solo in my opinion",0,2016-12-31T22:58:22Z

@kwonspo7839,"to anyone who's wondering why there's only 4 members here when SEVENTEEN has 13 members..... this one's for you.

*SEVENTEEN* is made up of 3 units: vocal team, hiphop team and performance team.

*HIGHLIGHT* is one of the songs from their Going Seventeen mini album which is sang by the performance team: *Jun, Hoshi, The8 and Dino*. the performance unit is in charge of the choreographies for SEVENTEEN's songs.

member timestamps (according to age):

0:13 - Wen Junhui, or *JUN* (96 liner, China line)
0:41 - Kwon Soonyoung, or *HOSHI* (leader of performance team unit, 96 liner, choreographer)
2:14 - Xu Minghao, or *THE8* (97 liner, China line)
1:33 - Lee Chan, or *DINO* (99 liner, maknae of SEVENTEEN)",400,2016-12-31T22:43:40Z

@Jaden3459,"Before I get into my comment, IS HOSHI GIVING ANYONE ELSE MAJOR TAEMIN VIBES?! I can't breathe!!! 

But anyway, I love my Hoshi (bias) and I think his choreos are brilliant but I don't think a lot of people realize from an unbiased perspective that Jun is probably the best dancer/performer in SVT. He brings an edge that the others have yet to replicate, it's really amazing to watch him go,  with this super confident, dramatic flair and every move is almost flawless in it's delivery. It doesn't hurt that his voice is amazing, which i'm really only noticing today, and he looks like a freaking statue. As our Hoshi said, it's really hard to pull off blue hair lol. If that wasn't enough he came out of nowhere rapping with this deep-ass voice?! Oh and he's a good actor? Does Pledis know they have an all-kill gem here? I might have to reconsider his ranking on my list, I hope he gets more popular.",12,2016-12-31T18:36:28Z

Why is Seventeen so talented? Their songs and choreos are so refreshing and addicting. I love Hoshi singing so much, I love hearing his singing voice. I actually realised this during the fanmeeting hehe. I love seeing more of The8 dancing and Jun singing. It's not that I dont like The8 singing and Jun dancing but you know, preferences I guess? haha. Also, OUR BABY CHAN! I seriously love hearing him rap and dance, it feels so nice in some way i cant explain. Overall, THIS MV OR WHATEVER YOU CALL IT IS JUST PLAIN PERFECT.

@oliviasmith1060,"All I wanted to say here is can people just stop the trend of justice for Chinaline for the next comeback? Like how some of you guys did in the Boom Boom mv when it first release. They must have a reason of why they dont get a lot of lines in the title track. Maybe they don't feel confident in their korean skills? Because this song has chinese lyrics. Hoshi composed this song.   So it means that Hoshi does want China line to shine as well so they put chinese lyrics on the chorus. Or maybe because they don't feel confident in singing live yet. I just hope you guys would just trust Seventeen and Pledis. They know China line better than us. So I hope you guys would stop that. It saddened me to see all those comments, let alone if the members see it. How do you think they would feel. Let's trust Seventeen and just respect their decision in 2017❤ Happy New Year Seventeen and co-Carats 😁",48,2016-12-31T18:18:45Z

Jun when I became a Carat during Mansae era you instantly captured my attention looking like Heechul (hardcore E.L.F right here represent!) but who said you can be my bias wrecker?? No Jun no no please take a back seat and stay there. I remember. Dino... omy where to start with you. These days I feel like you should be part of the Rap Unit instead of Performance I mean where did that talent come from? Not only are you a sick dancer but a rapper too!? Kill this hopeless noona now.. The8.. our precious The8. The moment I laid eyes on you I knew you were precious always shy and quiet, but secretly growing into the hot ""I can't even put into words"" man you are today. You killed it in this video and I'm so thrilled your lines this time were longer than 2 seconds i'm used to. You have sick talent, be confident and show it off! Keep at it SVT!

@TheCupcakeCup,"I love how SEVENTEEN always HIGHLIGHTs their members with a particular song or performances. It shows how much they want EVERYONE to be able to shine and NOT JUST CERTAIN MEMBERS. In EVERY ALBUM they always have one song specifically for each unit and it makes everything fair. I also notices that when they does special stages, they always gives most lines to the members that have less lines in their promoting title tracks. Like recently Jun and The8 sings most in Show Me Your Love. I love how they manage their group and I hope due to this unselfishness, they will last a long time. Anyways, HAPPY NEW YEAR SEVENTEEN AND CARATS! I LOVE YOU GUYS AND LETS CONTINUE SUPPORTING OUR SEBONGIES~ <3",5,2016-12-31T16:35:39Z

@kindredkian1,"The fact that when the sub units do a track it's edgier production and slightly more mature than 
actual Seventeen tracks which are definitely more on the bubblegum side is bothersome. It's why I can't get into Seventeen as a whole but So far the hip hop unit and performance unit are doing what Seventeen as a whole should be doing.....edgier production. From what I've seen so far its where they shine the most. I really like this track and Check In but I for the life of me I can't seem to get into boom boom or very nice.",3,2016-12-31T16:22:07Z
