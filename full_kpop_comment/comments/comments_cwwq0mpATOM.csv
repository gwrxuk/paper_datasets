I've ALWAYS said imo Chan is the best dancer in SVT idgaf what anyone else says.
It used to make me sad that only Hoshi got the recognition for his skills like bxtch hello??? MICHAEL CHANSON IS A DANCE GOD WHO DESERVES RECOGNITION.

@dinonara.fanboi,"one thing i love most about seventeen’s dancing is that they always telling a story through their dances . like example mr lee chan right here , he does it all the time but that last part where the lyrics “i don’t think i like me anymore , can someone tell me who i was before ...” and he just stares like he’s lost , looking for “himself” before , just like the lyrics say ... and it all fades out ... crazy .
i say it all the time but HOW did we survive this caratdeul ?? dinonara’s ??? because i don’t think i’ll EVER get over this lee chan .",270,2021-07-24T02:12:55Z

what i love so much about chan’s dancing ( and most of seventeen’s dances too ) is his ability to switch between fluid and sharp in his dances so beautifully . like i mean , some can do sharp very well , some can do smooth very well , some people can do one style amazingly ... but chan can do *all* . literally he said himself that he would like to show different styles of his dancing passion in every danceology ...
