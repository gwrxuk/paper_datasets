@allyminatozaki3880,"It's midnight here and I'm ugly crying again because this mv. I'm so afraid that twice will leave someday. I'm afraid I'll miss them. I don't know how to live without them being together with once. Maybe I involve my feelings too much, but really I don't know what to do if that time is really come. So guys, as long as they still here, let's appreciate them. Even if we can't give them trophies anymore, please make them as comfortable as they can with us, so they'll stay longer. Stop complaining over small things, i know we want the best for them, but, let's be honest, we're soooooooo lucky that they're still active as a group, we didn't lose any members, new music every year, still busy with tour, we even still got such 'small' things like TTT every week. Let's be grateful for all of that guys, I don't want to lose them, please.",4,2024-08-14T18:13:11Z

it feels a little dramatic to say that twice changed my life, but it would honestly be an understatement, if anything. i haven't even been a fan for a full year yet, but many of the friends I've made, the experiences I've had, the hours (days) of music I've spent consuming, the money I've spent 💀, and the change in my perspectives, were largely due to Twice. I'm so grateful to have these 9 girls to be inspired by and to find community through. It's a great feeling bonding with other Onces and enjoying the contents the girls work so hard to put out. 
From the bottom of my heart, thank you, Twice. I'll be a Once for as long as there is Twice :)",2,2022-06-23T17:51:15Z

We also know what will come some day, but it's too painful to write let alone imagine so we'll enjoy, love and support our 9 Angels from heaven for as long as we on earth have them. BUT, please don't cry fellow ONCE's. TWICE will forever be with us until the end of time when we join again at the end of a distant road, the place we seek is there, TWICELAND. 🍭🙏🌌🛐

트와이스가 내 삶에 들어와서 기쁩니다 트와이스는 우울함과 외로움에서 두 번 나를 행복하게 해 줍니다. 그들은 나를 웃게 만들고, 노래하고, 춤추고, 웃게 만들어요 그것들 없이는 살 수 없습니다. 트와이스가 사람을 행복하게 하는 중요한 사람을 개인적으로 보지 못해도 괜찮아. 언젠가 트와이스를 직접 만나서 그들의 콘서트 팬사인회와 다른 이벤트에 참석하고 트와이스의 모든 상품을 사고 그들을 만나기 위해 한국에 갈 것이라고 트와이스에 대한 내 꿈에 너무 늦지 않았으면 합니다. 여기서 사라져도 우리는 여전히 당신을 항상 사랑하고 지원합니다.

This song made me really emotional, one of the reasons is seeing them so happy being together in the video, they have been there for each other for so many years
Another reason is this video is posted on 10,20,2019 which is the day Mina came back from her hiatus, I guess it has a special meaning, twice will forever BE AS ONE ❤️
I’m a once since 2021 October , but I’ve known them since 2017 actually, and I know this time I will love them for many, many years

@Iris-sk1fc,"No one, definitely no artist had me cry before. I like different genres and I'm always just a 'casual listener' and never support the artists. I remembered, I always used to download songs using YT to mp3 because I hate ads but since I met Twice, my Spotify is always on premium. I'm streaming on YT. I downloaded voting apps. I'm using social media (Twitter) even though I hate social media, just to be updated. I never watched vlogs or other videos of other artists. I'm never interested to know each member's full name, the band name is more than enough to me but when I met Twice, I memorized their names and other details about each of them. I watched all variety shows, Twice's Elegant Private life, VLive, etc. I never ever dream of meeting artists in person but I've been wanting to meet Twice in person. I never love artists before because I always think that they are probably just being nice to their fans because fans are 'money makers' but when I met Twice everything changed in me. And that's because Twice is true to themselves. I feel their genuine love towards their fans. Twice may not beat other groups in terms of MV views, sales, streams, etc but they beat every other artist (I swear when I said 'ARTISTS' I mean a lot since I'm really into music of different genres) in my heart and that will remain the same until I get to build a cafe dedicated to them.",0,2021-08-04T13:20:08Z

@jeongyeon6530,"Lyrics :

보이지 않던 이 길의 끝에서
알 수 없었던 시간들
마치 어린아이 맘을 달래듯
나를 따스하게 안아준
내게 줬던 마음이 아름답게 피고 있어

마냥 웃고 있던 니 모습
선명하게 내게 보여
모든 것이 다 소중한
기억들이 될 수 있게

나를 비춘 별 하나
내가 너의 자릴 지켜 줄게
이젠 너와 나 항상 빛이 날 수 있게
내 손을 잡아 두 맘을 모아
힘껏 소리쳐 불러 줘
우릴 밝혀 줄 너무 아름다운 빛
단 하나의 별 Be as one

꿈꿔왔었던 내일의 모습이
(미래의 모습이)
조금은 달라 보여도
(앞이 보이질 않아도)
니가 있어 괜찮아 이젠 슬퍼도 울지 않아
니 곁에선 내가 다시 웃을 수 있어

맘껏 웃고 있을 니 모습
상상속에 그려보면
아낌없이 다 주고픈
내 맘이 닿을 수 있게

나를 비춘 별 하나
내가 너의 자릴 지켜 줄게
이젠 너와 나 항상 빛이 날 수 있게
내 손을 잡아 두 맘을 모아
힘껏 소리쳐 불러 줘
우릴 밝혀 줄 너무 아름다운 빛
단 하나의 별 너라서

미처 몰랐던 내게 닿은 소중한 너야
간직해둘게 우리들의 시간 나의 힘이 되어 줘
나와 함께 걸어 줘 나를 믿어 줘
언제나 니 곁에 함께 있을게

너를 위한 맘 하나
지금처럼 너와 함께할게
나의 맘이야 내 안에 널 간직할게
내 손을 잡아 두 맘을 모아 (Oh)
힘껏 소리쳐 불러 줘
우릴 밝혀 줄 너무 아름다운 빛
단 하나의 별 Be as one",2,2021-07-14T13:22:47Z

@princessmishramolinos1140,"I have been a fan of TWICE for six years. But who still dreamed of going to the concert, see them, sign an autograph with TWICE, can buy their product. But not so. case you are far from them, you cannot go to the concert because they do not allow you to go. Just watch their live, their MV. that's all you really are....Because you're young and you can't do it alone. Your parents can't be with you because they are so busy, so we're just there. It's sad because you can't go to the concert..So you're really just up to home...🥺😢💔

I literally stanned twice last month and I don't regret it. All I think about is all the songs, moments and memories they gave me since I became a Once. Although they aren't many compared to all the memories all of you had with them, still it makes me smile every time I remember them. Cheer up people! Cheer up because even though you didn't stan them since their debut, you still found them and their beautiful music. The fact that you found them is what matters, not when you found them. Don't get me wrong, I feel a bit of regret of not stanning them since the beginning but what matters is I found them. Even though it's a bit late, my one month of stanning twice has been one of the best decisions of my life and I know it is the same for all of you even though we didn't stan them since the beginning.

@tudunggiejjang2431,"I cried cuz I felt like I had a special connection with Twice... All these memories u don't know how will I explain it... And I know u won't get it too but the love for them is very high and I respect them so much.. all THESE years stanning them makes me not to leave them, I wonder if they ever leave me what will happen to me..? I'll became a dead living person. Their music is very special to me.. and this song is the reason that made me cry, the meaning behind the song, the memories I carried is uncountable. PEOPLE THINK THAT I LOVE THEM FOR THEIR LOOKS, BUT NO I LOVE THEM INSIDE I DONT CARE WHAT THEY LOOK. I'm not a kid... People think stanning a group and loving them is weird but I don't think so... Sometimes music is the universal language that connects u to one another and I'm glad I found TWICE...

Looking at this video and listening to this song remind me of the times I binge-watched TWICE videos until past my bed time. They were so young (and so was I...)They made me laugh and genuinely happy thru those videos, but while I look at them again now, they just make me nostalgic, and I can't help but cry... I hope I could show them my love and support more in the future and accompany them in their journey without any worries and sadness. 🧡🍭",18,2021-06-13T17:07:58Z

@mentosncoke2718,"I've already heard this song many times after it got released. Ngl, everytime i hear this song it makes me cry.

I'm not into Twice before when they debuted with such bubbly and cute concept, it's not my taste of music. I was a sone but after SNSD went on hiatus i became depressed, i was still a kid that time and i remember listening to their music at computer shops because we have no wifi. After that 2015 Twice debuted. At first I watch their music videos and support them silently but i'm not fully support since i promised to my self that i will stan only one group that has nine members and that is SNSD.

As years passed, i don't stan KPOP anymore then after i heard the song What is Love i became a kpop stan again! I already know them so its easy for me to know their names. I was happy that I have another group to stan but at the same time i'm scared because there are too many what ifs going on in my mind. ""what if they disband?"" ""What if the Twice i know and the reason that always brightens up my day will no longer be there?"". There's too much of it but only thing i know is if Twice disband this will be my the last stop to KPOP, I can't afford another heartache again. They are my source of energy and even though i'm just a stranger to them, the connection that they give us through music is so pure and irreplaceable. If I ever meet them someday in person, i would thank them for making me of what i am today, though I'm still young but the maturity they give to me means so much. We all know when that time comes ""if twice disband"" the only lost that we have is not seeing them being together but the presence of their love and care to us ONCE would always remain. 

If you're going through something just listen to this because this song means that no matter what happen TWICE will be forever at our side. #ONCEFOREVER",43,2021-02-03T17:10:07Z

  my classmates use to play their videos on our classroom almost every day and  i simply just don't care, cause i hate kpop on that days

But now it's so hard for me to accept that one day they will disband and I only know them for 4 months

Two years ago I just met the groups that make me feel the word happiness 
They taught me the real feel of love,
They just heal me as a person
I'm thankful and grateful to have some time to be with this girls, worried at the same time 
That they might disappear someday

Onces promise me that will always be here at twice side tru Ups and down 
That will goes with them everytime 
We must protect them to those human who keep them bringing down


Today as once i promise to not forgive
 twice's  act as my super heroes


Till the  last goodbyes

@KaijjangLyrik,"I'm happy to know Twice. Back then, I suffered a lot but no one knew what I was going through. I'm usually a cheerful person in front of my friends but I'm not the type who shares her feelings to others so it's quite problematic. I came to one of the lowest points in my life where I was having suicidal thoughts due to existential crisis and everything within and around me felt exhausting, I even attempted once. I'm not a fan of Kpop before but when a friend showed me the mv of TT, I got curious. I've become a fan since then and for that I am forever grateful. Nothing's for sure, but if not for Twice, I think I would not be here anymore.",0,2020-11-27T19:08:23Z

I'm scared one day they will get disband but whatever happens I will stay with them.



To be honest I was scared to watch this video because I might shed in tears thinking they are getting old and someday they will marry someone who will love them more than we do and have kids. I'm scared but it's their life so I'll just support them and stay with them until their last breath. <3",0,2020-09-29T20:47:16Z

Now I am studying in university to pursue my dreams, and Twice has become nation's group and INTERNATIONAL superstars loved by more and more people around the world. Can't believe how much we went through already. Thank you for cheering me up with uplifting music and funny videos, thank you for giving millions of us hope and strength, thank you for bringing positive energy into the world, thank you for everything that you are.

@Nanomi33,"보이지 않던 이 길의 끝에서
알 수 없었던 시간들
마치 어린아이 맘을 달래듯
나를 따스하게 안아준
내게 줬던 마음이 아름답게 피고 있어
마냥 웃고 있던 네 모습 선명하게 내게 보여
모든 것이 다 소중한 기억들이 될 수 있게
나를 비춘 별 하나 내가 너의 자릴 지켜줄게
이젠 너와 나 항상 빛이 날 수 있게
내 손을 잡아 두 맘을 모아 힘껏 소리쳐 불러줘
우릴 밝혀 줄 너무 아름다운 빛
단 하나의 별 Be as one
꿈꿔왔었던 내일의 모습이
미래의 모습이
조금은 달라 보여도
앞이 보이질 않아도
네가 있어 괜찮아 이젠 슬퍼도 울지 않아
네 곁에선 내가 다시 웃을 수 있어
맘껏 웃고 있을 네 모습 상상속에 그려보면
아낌없이 다 주고픈 내 맘이 닿을 수 있게
나를 비춘 별 하나 내가 너의 자릴 지켜줄게
이젠 너와 나 항상 빛이 날 수 있게
내 손을 잡아 두 맘을 모아 힘껏 소리쳐 불러줘
우릴 밝혀 줄 너무 아름다운 빛
단 하나의 별 너라서
미처 몰랐던 내게 닿은 소중한 너야
간직해둘게 우리들의 시간 나의 힘이 되어줘
나와 함께 걸어줘 나를 믿어줘
언제나 네 곁에 함께 있을게
너를 위한 맘 하나 지금처럼 너와 함께할게
나의 맘이야 내 안에 널 간직할게
내 손을 잡아 두 맘을 모아 힘껏 소리쳐 불러줘
우릴 밝혀 줄 너무 아름다운 빛
단 하나의 별 Be as one",8,2020-07-22T12:25:39Z

@bunnyxyeon4159,"Hi! Here there is how I think I will react the day I open Twitter and all the tweets say something about TWICE disbanding:
I will open Twitter to see what are my friends tweeting, if there are news about TWICE, but I will only see a lot of people tweeting about how TWICE changed their lives and saying ""thanks"" to TWICE. I will be like: ""Uhm... Maybe it's just a Trending Topic of Onces talking about how TWICE changed their lives?
Then I will see a tweet saying that TWICE disbanded, at first I will probably be like "" What? No, no no no, this can't be real, it's just a rumour"". But then I will see more tweets about that...
I will just start crying...
""I think I will sleep, this is just a dream""
*Next Day*
I will wake up being happy because TWICE didn't disbanded, it was just a dream...
But then I will still see the news about TWICE disbanding... And then is when I will release it is not a dream...
I will feel how a tear falls, and then I will start crying...
After some minutes I will calm down and I will go to the kitchen to eat my breakfast, I will go back to my room, and I will listen to a playlist of my favourite songs from TWICE, I will be listening while looking at the wall, trying to not thing about the disbanding...
My playlust will finish with Be As One, since it starts I will start crying, And when it finishes I will search ""Sixteen final episode"", then I will watch other programmes where TWICE appeared and I will laugh everytime they do something funny, but I won't be able to stop some tears.
Time will pass, I will go everyday to university while listening to TWICE songs, then I will become an adult, I will start dating someone, I will start working, I will marry someone, I will have childs...
Then one day my son will say to me ""Dad! Dad! I found something In your room!""
He will show to me a TWICE's album, a lot of moments will come to my mind, when I laughed while seeing them In variety shows, dancing to their songs, going to one of their concerts, and then... When I saw they disbanded...
I will start crying, my son will ask me why I'm crying, and then I will tell him about TWICE and How they changed my life.
Thank You TWICE. You will always be In my heart :,) <3",76,2020-06-30T06:42:29Z

@mariaakaannie6138,"Twice's hearts are what makes them special. They are so kind. 
That kindness may be misunderstood as being soft or naive, but no they are incredibly strong and resilient. 
They've met hate and controversy since their beginning but always stood strong against the storm.
They stand up for themselves.
They stand up for the weak.
They work as hard as possible, even in rehearsal.
They respect others.
They care about staff members.
They remain humble.
They are all kind, but not soft, just as Chaeyoung wanted to be.",0,2020-06-24T16:03:26Z

One day I will stop shouting your name
One day I will stop dreaming about you
One day I'll stop with this stupid game
I know one day, whether I like it or not, my body will be much more mature

The smile that I used to see, one day I no longer remember
But one thing is certain, Even though my memory disappears
My heart will find a way to bring me back, to the time when I still dreamed about you.
My brain might not be able to function, but my heart and mind are still beating for the 9 women I'm always proud of


So thank you....
Even though you don't know that I exist
You are special!!

@tewwwwww,"i think the reason that the views is only 1.4M bcoz onces are afraid to open this mv[including me],realizing that someday it will be their last everything,and all we can do is just remembering their happiness moment,when they are playin in their dorm,when they are hugging each other,when they are crying at their concert.I know my comment will bust you out in tears,but guys nothin lasts forever,and thats how this life works,hope we can be young forever,but its not the way it works,we have to go the other way.


and for Twice,thank you for being our light,we will always love you no matter what,someday you guys  will disband,and it hurts to imagine that,but we know the day will come. So before that day comes,i would say thank you for changing my life,thank you for your hard work,thank you for your smile,thank you for your time that has passed,thank you for everything,it feels like i want to hug you guys before that day comes,but i know it will never happen,though its hard to let you guys go


so onces,we should appreciate them while we still can

Because this Group shall we say Blessings 9 different angels that sent from above that make our life easier that help us forget what the cruel world affect us. And they let us see the world in a beautiful side even when the World wants to drag and belittle Us. I will not regret the day when I've been supporting and loving them.

So i will say this Twice thank you for making us happy, thank you for everything you did to us to  and lastly thank you for being caring and loving twice and i wish that someday you will have a reunion one last time after you all have solo careers😭😭😭😭😭",18,2020-03-25T14:42:33Z

We will sing their songs without hoping that there will be another song released by tomorrow, next week, next month, or even next next year. Imagine Nayeon waking up and she’s ready to go so loud but then she realize that she lives alone now. She’s not with Twice anymore. Imagine Jeongyeon. She’s about to shout and ask who did the mess but she remembered that NaMoSaJiMiDaChaeTzu isn’t there because they have their own lives now. Imagine Momo getting ready to go to the ref to steal Jihyo’s jokbal but as she opened the ref she realized that she’s not with Twice anymore. Imagine Sana wanting to go to the Maknae’s room but as she go outside her room, she saw her own house and not their dorm. Imagine Jihyo waking up and she’s ready to wake up everyone but without any reason she remembered that all of them had their own ways to go. Imagine Mina doing a Vlive alone and she’s speaking so loud because she remember Twice telling her to speak often and loud during her vlive. Imagine Dahyun playing the piano while she’s remembering every memory she did with Twice. Imagine Chaeyoung coming home with a bag full of strawberries she bought for them but as she opened the door, she realized that only her was living there. Imagine Tzuyu hugging Minjoong while crying because she remember herself being savage to her unnies, and she remember that all of them hugged Minjoong. She hugged Minjoong so tight because that’s the only thing left that will make her feel that she’s still with Twice. Imagine yourself trying to be calm as you heard the news that Twice will disband. You searched if it’s true because maybe it’s just a rumor. You searched and searched. But you can’t stop your tears as u read the article. Your phone’s screen was so wet because every drop. of your tear was going there. You just really can’t. You slept hoping that it’s just a dream. But as u wake up, there’s still no Twice. You opened your candybong while One In A Million was playing. You’re crying while accepting the truth that you have to let them go.

@ChrisDR1,"Estuve mucho tiempo pensando en escribir esto jajaja pero aquí vamos : 
A comienzos de este año fue que conocí a TWICE, la verdad no esperaba que fuera tan importante haber conocido un grupo de cantantes en mi vida, pero la verdad de las cosas es que las conocí en el momento indicado. estaba pasando momentos complicados  donde todo era tristeza en mis días (no exagero) comencé a asistir a terapia por decisión propia para poder sobrellevar mis conflictos. sin embargo cuando conocí a estas 9 chicas que me cautivaron de inmediato con ""whats is love?"" hizo que mi animo subiera mucho. quise seguir sintiendo esta sensación por lo que seguí averiguando y buscando sus canciones que me hacían tener la misma sensación de alegría y gozo... me sentí feliz de nuevo por mucho tiempo, retome mis actividades, mis hoobies , lo que amaba hacer y todo gracias a TWICE. en la actualidad no dejo de escucharlas de alegrarme, cuando voy por la calle , cuando e pongo mis audífonos en el gimnasio. es por esto que me gustaría agradecerles por darle alegría a mis días. si algún día vuelven a Chile y tengo la oportunidad de conocerlas con mucho respeto y tengo si tengo la oportunidad les diré GRACIAS en persona porque puedo sonreír mucho mas hoy. 
GRACIAS.

@badekeskin9565,"Sizi o kadar çok seviyorumki, mutsuz anımda beni neşelendirdiniz, yalnız kaldığımda yanımda olduğunuzu hissedirdiniz, aramızda kmler olmasına rağmen kalplerimiz yan yanaydı sanki... Ben sizi çok geç tanıdım, bu konuda o kadar pişmanımki. Daha Once olalı 1 yıl kadar oldu ama bana sanki yıllar gibi geldi. Hergün kendime yıllar sonra bile sizi hatırlıyacağıma dair söz veriyorum. Sizin yerinizi kimse dolduramaz. Bana kendimi sevmem gerektiğini öğrettiniz. 

İnsanlar size yeteneksiz, rap yapamayan, beceriksiz, sadece tatlılar, estetikli dediler... Ama hiçbiri sizin güzel kalplerinize bir şey bulamadılar, bazıları ise birbirini sevmeyen twice kızları (!) dedi. Onlar istemediler yada işlerine gelmedi sizin birbiriniz arasındaki kuvvetli bağı görmek. Siz 9 kız kardeş her zaman birbirinizi sarıp kolladınız ve öylede devam edecek. Kim ne derse desin siz bu dünyadaki en mükemmel kız grubusunuz. Bu dünyaya bir daha Twice gibi bir grup gelmez, o yüzden dünyadaki en şanslı milyonlarca insandan biriyim, çünkü ben bir Onceım. Bir yerde okumuştum gelecek nesillere acıyorum çünkü onlar Twice gibi bir grubu tanımıyor olacak... Yıllar sonra inşallah hayatınız aşklarını bulursunuz ve güzel bir aileniz olur... Ama sizin için en büyük ailenin kendi grubunuz ve biz olduğunu biliyoruz. 
Sizi sonsuza kadar seveceğim kızlar.

@m.s1280,"One day I won’t be here I will have my own life and hopefully someone that loves me and have a family. But I will never fo get what twice have done for me. They will always be my favourite girl group and no one would ever replace them. I’m thankful that these girls at  in my life an d I know them and that I know who they are. Without them I wouldn’t be here I wouldn’t be in the place that I am at now. 

One day everything will be gone with twice we should be thankful that we got to know them and happy that they’re were a group. I will still continue supporting them no matter what no matter what happens. They’ve helped me through so much. It’s unexplainable how much I love them. The 9 beautiful souls that came together to creat this group which everyone here loves. We all love them so much. They were always there for twice and we were always there for them thank you so much for that twice. I hope you all remember us once and you will never forget us.

It’s hard to let something go. I know that. We all know that. As much as we love these nine girls we will have to let them go one day. Who cares when it is even if it’s when you die. We will continue loving them for who they are and for what they did for us. Giving up their sleep,their time and so much more to make us happy is amazing and lovely. We will always love them no matter what. We will never forget them. We will continue supporting them through everything.

Twice I thank you so much for being my light through my dark times, I thank you so much for being there when I needed someone the most, thank you for being there when u wasn’t feeling great and was having a tuff time. Thank you for everything you have done for me. Your the best girls I know the best people ever. I can always rely on you. Thank you so much I love you so much. We will always love every single in of you. I certainly wasn’t here from the beginning but I will be with you every step of the way till the very end. Thank you so much. I love you guys so much it’s unexplainable. Thank you for what you have done I will continue supporting you. Thank you. I love you a lot.❤️

(be as one lyrics eng) 


I could not see the end of the road
The weather could not be seen
As if to comfort a child
Hold me warmly
It left my heart
With beauty guilty

You look like you were laughing
Show me clearly
All these thoughts are precious
So they are worth remembering

A star that shines on me
Will always protect us
Now, you and I can always shine
Take my hand and leave the two hearts together
Give me all your strength
A very beautiful light to illuminate us
Until the stars be as one

I dreamed about tomorrow
With the future
Even if it seems a little different
Even if you do not see it
It's alright
I will not cry anymore
Standing by your side, I can laugh again

You are smiling all the time
If you imagine how this is,
I hope you give me everything
I can reach your heart

A star that shines on me
Will always protect us
Now, you and I can always shine
Take my hand and leave the two hearts together
Give me all your strength
A very beautiful light to illuminate us
Because you are the only one star

You didn't knew I was precious to you
Let's keep our time
But let me be my own strength
Walk with me and you can always trust me
I'll always be there with you

A heart for you
I'll be with you as I am now
It's my heart and I'll keep you in me
Take my hand and leave the two hearts together
Give me all your strength
A very beautiful light to illuminate us
Until the stars be as one",0,2019-10-23T02:51:18Z

@hisiriqueen7953,"GUYS REMEMBER THIS...
twice, TWICE is not just a group they are family who keeps showing us inspiration, love, care and everything they can make us happy everyday every night remember that they are here for us they show us love and everything we have never expected even if they are far from us they still show us as of they are so close and acted as if they know us for so long they are comfortable remember them wearing normal and comfortable clotse at ther fan sigh?? is because they are much more like them selfs more than anything.

I'm happy because they've reach their goals. Their Happiness is ONCEs Happiness

I'm so thankful that I met TWICE because without them I wouldn't learn 2 lesson. And that lessons are: 1. Be happy and don't envy someone because they reach their dream and you didn't reach yours.
2. Be hard working, and be patient..",0,2019-10-21T13:34:15Z

これ見た瞬間涙が流れました。
最初はジヒョペンだったけど沢山愛して冷め期が来ました(ジヒョの)
決してジヒョを嫌いになった訳ではありません。
そしてナヨンペンに入学して沢山のことがありました。
ミナちゃんが体調を崩してしまったり
サナちゃんが炎上してしまったり、
日韓関係でミサモが叩かれたり
沢山の事がありました。
ジヒョちゃんの熱愛騒動が出た時に
私はおめでとうという気持ちでいっぱいでした。
TikTokでジヒョちゃんの事を語っている人も沢山いました｡

I'm proud because they stayed brave and hard working,they've faced a lot of challenges but they still continue to do their best and pour their efforts and hardwork for everything. They still stayed as one group with understanding and love for each other. I admire them a lot coz they're not just beautiful but they're very talented and hard working. They have kind and nice personalities and they are a good example of an idol. I can't just explain a lot how proud I am. 

I'm thankful for the happiness and inspiration they gave me and every once. 

I won't ever regret to idolize then coz twice is always the best. And they deserve a lot of reward. I love them forever. Thank you Twice,I'm proud for the 4 years.

Dear TWICE,

I know you don't actually know me cause I'm just a boy from the crowd and plus,you have quite a lot of fans more than just me.
Your smile always make me feel so special,I was just a 12 year old when I started to like you as a group,all these years,you're the only one who's running in my mind,everytime I watch your music videos,stream your tracklists on spotify and everything.

I'm just here to say how important you are in my life,you made me who I am now,without you,maybe I still have some anxiety until now.You helped me get through all of my problems and my depressions and I want to thank you for that.

It's been 3 years but I'm still here to support you,even if you didn't even know that I exist.Someday we'll meet,maybe I can't get your attention but still I saw you and you saw me,its okay if you don't love the way I loved you,I'm just One among the million anyway.This day is very important to me and of course to you,it's your 4th year anniversary,promise me you'll live a life full of happiness,I always loved you.Kamsa~

1 Smile can send a lot of love,

1 Solid Fandom they called ""Once"", 
1 person to made this things all come true(Thankyou soooo much)
I am ""ONE in a million"" of ONCE that has watch this, wishing for OT9 to stay together forever. Even if they had husbands or wifes, had childrens, choose to live in different ways, choose fight for what they want and be happy with it while facing more critics that will come, or grow older.

Once day there’ll be not Twice NeJeongMoSaJiMiDaChaeTzu anymore, they’ll become Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Momo, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun, Chaeyoung, and Tzuyu. Then there will only a solo song, a solo activities, a solo interview, a solo concert... Our nine angel will apart and we can’t anymore waiting for group pictures, group albums, group tour concert, group hug............

To Once in the future: Pls stay strong because there’ll not Twice forever but there’ll always be Once forever. I hope we still put our heart together,  holding each other hands and walk with this same energy ever. OnceTwiceJalja ❤️",1,2019-10-21T05:03:14Z

People keep saying that they just got lucky, its because they are from jyp and all that shit but lets cut the crap, they worked hard for this. Im not saying other groups dont work hard but these girls devoted everything to be twice. Heck they starved themselves during sixteen just to maintain weight, practice and etc. they dont get enough sleep and they are being monitored 24/7, haters shouldn’t be so ignorant. They have so much in their hands and all these haters do is criticize them, dont they see all the hardships they have to overcome?

@lilixi1278,"This is one of the most beautiful fandom i ever see same goes to their idol which is Twice.

This is a real story of mine. I used to be like i don't stanning them. Its because i kinda not down for a cute concept and i thought that Twice is the same one as the other cute concept girlgroup but then after i watch running man and i saw a lot of their song and dance cover and because my brother is a once he love listening to Twice song and i heard their song almost every day but i didnt have any hatred its just im not into.

But after quite a long time without knowing it i actually stanning them like quietly. I know that i like their song and i love their personality and i could see those talents and skills and how much have they work for Twice but i just dont want to admit it because i had a tough personality and people around me used to make a joke about me like something soft cute type. However after like TT era i begin to change my pace. Because i keep having this in my mind that i shouldnt be like this. Fxck all those people. Let them say what they wanna say because stanning or liking something dont cause any harm unless youre obsessed which is problem with your mental. And from there i keep watching them and they teach me a lot of thing and recently i watch sixteen back. And from there i learn that i need to be strong in any situation. Im a timid person and seeing them work so hard for their dreams really does something to me. I also love how Twice bonds with their fans Once. Its really beautiful. Thank You for everything Twice lets keep move on to the top💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖",31,2019-10-21T01:11:31Z

But we managed to get over that we stayed by their side and will never ever leave and still supported them because we ONCE will support them AS ONE no matter what. They are my inspiration why i live and my happiness sadly soon they will disband but im not saying should be sad by that we cherish those times when they are still twice. Im ONE IN A MILLION who laughs alongside them, im ONE IN A MILLION who got excited when ever they sing and dance, im ONE IN A MILLION who cried with them and of course im ONE IN A MILLION who loved and supported them.

@garciajamesaldrine,"4 years.

4 years of hardwork.
4 years of tears.
4 years of happiness.
4 years of hardships.

Yet,

You're still here standing in every stages just to make us happy. To inspire us. You wanted to do this, for us. Not for yourself. Smiling to us even if it's forced, just to make us satisfied. Although we're millions of miles apart, you will always be in our heart. You changed me. You changed everyone. Although we don't know each other that much, and you don't really know us, I just want to say that we love you. 

Happy 4th anniversary, to the ones that inspired me, TWICE.

Twice and Once is ONE.",80,2019-10-20T21:20:12Z

@hraf192,"I don't actually love kpop songs or groups (but of course I know some great groups).. 'cause i just put my interests in the dramas and variety shows.. one time i was watching sugarman show and TWICE is the guest. That's the moment that I knew I was fell in love with TWICE..
So strange for me at first, i spend the time by searching every videos, photos and everything about TWICE. For the first time in my life I was wondering about a group, not even GG, WG, SISTAR, 2PM, BEAST, BIGBANG, SJ and not even my bias group MISS A (Fei is a bae btw). Whoaaaa how can this happen? Until now I don't know why. I know Twice not that great on singing.. but the atmosphere when they sing and perform is like a whole new world for me, so strange.... 
TWICE as many people know about is getting the hate from the world.. it is not because of they do something bad, but it's because TWICE is really strange for them too. THE GREAT NATION GIRLS GROUP, they are sooooooooo deserved. Working so hard to get more and more closer to their dreams, put so much efforts to get what they wants and still humble to everyone is what they do from debut until now

I AM SO PROUD TO STAN THIS GROUP AND TO BECOME ONCE.

I STAN TWICE",1,2019-10-20T20:35:10Z

@mspiggyping,"I was once a hater of kpop (but I kept it all to myself ofc, I still have respect before) . I really hate people who would overact when they talk about it. But that all change when I met these girls. When I first saw clips of them, I had a lot of laughs, but still I was firm that I don't like kpop, I kept thinking that it was just because I was sad or depressed (I am not joking) that I found myself laughing at them. But as time goes by, I kept seeing myself watching videos of them, laughing when they laugh, crying when they cry, I was stanning them. I tried to open up myself to the other groups, yes they also entertain me as well, however, twice is the only one I'm attached to. I was really angry to myself before, I judged others for being attached to their idols. But the fact that they can really help you cure loneliness is really something else. They are the reason that I believe that even if the world is full of sadness, there's always someone that will make you smile.

Thank you Twice, for saving me, for saving a lot of people that is suffering. Until now, it's really a depressing day, but seeing you gives me hope to continue on living.

@joonity1268,"•they've worked so hard
•they made teamwork happen
•they love each other
•they attracted more fans just by being themselves
•they showed how amazing they are
•they had fun
•they made ONCE be such an international fandom
•they just ignore haters yet not trying to be rude
•they've gone through anxiety but still wanted to film the video as OT9
•they will grow as BFFs till they die
•they made me cry
•they are TWICE
There's always many things to say about Twice and now it's already been 4 years since they were formed by JYP and SIXTEEN. Tzuyu might not actually be there be she wasn't in the original line up. 3Mix were going to debut but was cancelled. There are way more possibilities but because of these events, it made TWICE become TWICE. I'm really happy for the girls and I can't even imagine what happens when they disband... hopefully they last like SNSD but OT9 forever❤️💜",339,2019-10-20T18:20:47Z

@jldionido8014,I actually hate kpop before and all those people who support this industry. Maybe because it's not that popular in our place and I love old school things. However a friend of mine who is a big fan of KPOP suggested to start watching Kdrama and to try listening to TWICE for me to know why. That was almost 2 years ago. Thank God I tried it! TWICE is one of the main reason why I embraced KPOP into my life. I hate the fact that I'm not aware and haven't supported them where they started. How I wish that I can go back in time and witness all the things that I missed. I'll be supporting this group until I die!! HAPPY 4TH YEAR ANNIVERSARY!!!!,0,2019-10-20T18:01:51Z

When you have a concert on Philippines i got exited. I tell my mom that they have a concert in the Philippines, but when we are asking for the tickets the woman said that it was sold out. I was super shocked and i bursted in tears. When it’s the concert day. I just waited outside, hoping that i’ll meet them when the concert ends. There are so many once that are waiting outside hoping that they’ll meet them. When i was with the other once i feel super happy. When they got out to th e arena, i was so happy because i see Jihyo.


To the all of haters of TWICE back off. And please stop comparing BP and TWICE. Can’t you see they are BESTFRIENDS! TWICE might not be the best Girl group of KPOP, but atleast they are doing their best. I all wanna fight the BLINKS for not understanding that TWICE needs to rest too. I know BLINKS love BLACKPINK, but please stop commenting something bad to them. Did TWICE hurts BLINKS? “NO”
Did TWICE hurts BLACKPINK? “No”.
So what’s the point of being angry with TWICE? I am a little bit angry to my cousin, because she really hates TWICE. She just like BLACKPINK and BTS. I understand her cause i like BTS too. I’m also a ARMY. I said to her “TWICE and BLACKPINK are friends ok?” And she said ok. The day that i told her about that she became a ONCE too. So i’m asking a favor to TWICE haters. Please stop hating them cause they didn’t even do anything to you guys...Please i’m begging you... Thank you!


TWICE remember that ONCE love you all. I love youuu!!!! We are now 4 years old!!!.. I’m so happyyy!!! Thank you for your hard working guys!!! Thank youu😘.

@stephaniepham8930,"I dont know how to say but TWICE is like a part of my youth . I knew them when i was in grade 5 , during Cheer Up era . I was impressed by Mina . I watched a lot of videos about them, tried to find information and remembered them one by one.  From there I became ONCE.  The reason I became ONCE is not only because of their beauty, but also because of their hard work and solidarity.  TWICE is like a family, they are 9 inseparably perfect pieces.  I love the way they care about each other little by little.  I even feel that I belong to a part of that family.  From the 9 girls I learned a lot of lessons, they are a great motivation for me.  If I were born again and TWICE still exists, I will still decide to become ONCE again.  Let's go together for a long time , forever and ever . One in a million , love you guys  ONCE , LOVE YOU TOO  thank you for being ONCE . TWICE , thank you for being yourself , to chose TWICE as your second family . 
Thank you",0,2019-10-20T17:05:32Z

@ichronic6536,"I just want to share my experience with TWICE. How I met them and how they've changed me.

So I am a 16 year old boy and just like a lot of people, I never liked Kpop. And I never see myself as someone who would become a Kpop fan someday. Because like most of the people who do not like Kpop, I used to think that it is unnecessary to listen to and is not meant to be taken seriously. I would tease those Kpop fans I know thinking how foolish it is for them to like Kpop. I would even call it ""gay"" as it is very common here (I'm from Philippines btw) for us to call it that way especially for boys. So to cut the long story short, I've known some songs that were a hit in my country like 'Nobody' by Wonder Girls and also some songs of PSY (esp Gentleman) but I never liked it. But then came 2016 (TT era) when I saw one of my classmates dancing to 'TT'. At first I find it ridiculous and I thought it was a joke or something as it can mean something different in my place (lol). But I don't know what got into my mind why I searched it on Youtube thinking I would see something funny. And look who was surprised. I find them very2 cute and the song was very catchy! Btw, for those who were wondering why they were called TWICE, it is because they would charm you twice. Through their visuals and their songs (or even talent). This seems to be the situation in my case. I was attracted to them TWICE! And from there, I started learning their names which was very hard for me at first since I can't tell them apart. But as time goes by, I learned more and more about them and I was completely dragged to them and also Kpop in general. From that point, TWICE became my everything. I've laughed with them, cried with them, and learn a lot of things. I would never regret stanning them as it was the best thing I ever did. I would like to thank them for everything they've done for me. To them, I may be just one of their fans but to me, they are my life. Happy 4th Anniversary, TWICE! It's been four years already and you've been through a lot of things together, and of course with us ONCES. I wish you all the best in life. I wish you all good health and please always take care of yourselves. Continue inspiring more people. I just hope that I could be able to meet you someday. I love you Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Momo, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun, Chaeyoung, Tzuyu. And thank you for everything. ONCE, TWICE FIGHTING! <3",0,2019-10-20T16:56:54Z

You will have to leave us behind.
Someday,
You would have to leave each other, too.
And someday,
May be we won't meet again.
For all those days and times,
We all've been passed throught.
I've been wondering 
How could that be.
We made a long way, till we reach here. 
We wrote our story on our way,
We made sure no one left behind,
We started all together.....,
And we are here,
At this very meaningful time.
All the lights, that shine;
All the songs, we sung;
All the time we spent;
And for all those smiles,cries and tears we shed,
You make us believing in hope.
You make us believing in happiness.
You make us believe in the word LIFE.
You make us cry,
You make us smile,
You knock us hard,
And you shake our hearts.
You make us proud to be a part of your life.
And throught all those hardship,
You always came back for us.
May be we only get this life Once,
I'm sure that I've stayed this life for you, TWICE.

Untill the very end of time, 
We won't leave your side.
As long as theres TWICE,
There will be ONCE.

デビューから4周年おめでとうございます。
4年経った今、めでたいことや、悲しい事、様々な問題など色々な事がありましたが、
「TWICEだから」乗り越えられた事ばかりだと思います。統率力のあるリーダージヒョがいて、面倒を見るジョンヨンがいて、盛り上げつつも切り替えが素早いナヨンお姉さんがいて、体力凄くてダンシングマシンのモモがいて、セクシー、カワイイ系のトップレベルに君臨するサナがいて、大人しいながらもメンバーの面倒見るミナがいて、超ムードメーカーで元気にしてくれるダヒョンがいて、いつもメンバーの癒しになりつつ幼いチェヨンがいて、ビジュアルとダンスをかけ備えたツウィがいて…。この個性あるれる9人だからこそ、協調性が際立って乗り越えられたと思います。多忙な毎日を過ごす中で、ストレスや批判を浴びる中もお互いが支え合い、励ましあって成長してファンの前では笑顔を絶やさずいてくれるTWICEが大好きです。

TWICEのファンになって本当に良かったです。一生記憶に残り続ける存在です。

@michaengforever9384,"I can't believe they've been around for 4 years. I was here only after Likey, and it was like love at first sight. I didn't really become a Once at that instance, but I've always known that they'll have a special place in my heart one day, which is when they released YoY. I started stanning them, and after several bias-wrecking, I ended up with my ultimate bias, the penguin in the room, Myoi Sharon Minari. I really wish I had known them earlier. I went through a lot of emotional hell throughout my college years, alone, until I met them. They never fail to make me smile. What people don't know is the other side of the story, behind their laughs and smiles they are working really hard for everyone, not just for Onces. They have a humble beginning and purpose, never look down on others and respect everybody around them. The fact that they take hates the hard way is that they value others opinion, which is the reason why they're doing all these. They are trying to spread good messages, through their music and actions in public. I mean, have you seen their lyrics? Or how they treat people around them? If were to choose my role model when I was a kid, it'll be these 9 hardworking and humble girls. I feel so attached to them that it hurts when they're hurt. The past months have been a hell for both Twice, remember when Sana got that hate comments on her home country appreciation post, when Jeongyeon cried in front of the camera pleaded for rest, and recently Mina's anxiety. Any recent Twice TV will have the members asking for time to rest. This breaks my heart. Surely, there's no point on blaming anyone, what can we do is to always support and pray for them. It is their 4th anniversary, and what I can say is that I wish they can be happy and healthy at all time. I wish they can spend more time with their family, friends, and each other or whatever that makes them happy because they deserve it. Happy Birthday, Twice! We will always love and support you.",1,2019-10-20T16:47:45Z

i know that they will be having a family

even though, i am not your fan since your debut, i'm always here to support you girls, no matter what happened.

@Odd_Cinderella,"What a beautiful anniversary MV. I came into liking TWICE later than most ONCE as my journey into K-Pop in General has been extremely recent (I am going on Year 2 right now being a Multi-Fan) so, I wouldn't be able to feel the same feelings as everyone else, but, I still felt the emotion behind this MV and it made me want to cry. 


Thank you for your successes, TWICE and I hope you continue amazing us fans and especially to the ONCE. Keep fighting girls! Know that we're waiting for you!",0,2019-10-20T16:46:24Z

@mimi-dg5yy,"Seeing these girls grow over the years makes me really emotional. The fact that they stayed strong with all the hate they had for a long time is just beautiful. I have to confess, I’ve been a kpop fan for 3 years, and didn’t like Twice at first. But after a while, getting to know that they aren’t who people say they are makes me regret not liking them at the start. Now the girls have inspired me and many ONCE’s through so many things, each member gives each of us hope and makes us feel special. I’m so glad they are back as a group, rest well Mina, Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Momo, Jihyo, Sana, Chaeyoung, Dahyun, and Tsuyu. We love you all, we hope we made you feel special. 💕",0,2019-10-20T16:45:53Z

@Mi-fs1nb,"Imagine Twice disbanding. This is the last song they will ever make, the last mv. There’s going to be last special concert for onces. You can’t stop crying in your room. You miss them already. It’s the day of the concert. After getting ready, you’re running to catch your bus since you’re quite late. As you arrive to the concert place you start crying a little bit when you see all of these sad onces. Concert began. Members’ voices are cracking but they still try to smile. You and all of the fans start to cry. Y’all still can’t believe it’s happening. Twice - you’re ultimate gg - is disbanding. Concert is almost over. Every single member is saying their speeches. You start crying even more than before. Jihyo as the leader of Twice says the final speech. Of course she’s crying while talking. When girls went off the stage, no one could even move. After some time you went home, locked the doors of your room and started listening to all of Twice’s songs. Even tho you don’t want them to disband, you’re really thankful for these 9 girls who changed your life. They helped you go through hard times, cheered you up by their music and made you feel special and loved. 

You were grateful that you had someone like them. You will never forget 9 girls who completely changed your life.",1,2019-10-20T16:44:22Z
@diana9855,"Who would have thought that a group of nine girls would be one of the main reasons I can laugh today 
Today I’m crying but it’s not the sad tears I cried before, they’re happy tears, because these girls helped grow up so much in just the span of one year. They taught me that I can overcome my weaknesses and that the world will always be working against you, that I don’t need validation from the outside because I make myself feel special they make me feel special my close friends and family make me feel special. 
Mina you’re so strong, to be working against anxiety in the industry you’re in is beyond admirable. We don’t want you to comeback until you’re ready, there is no rush you’re to important  
Chae you little rebel, you’re such an artist I’m glad that even with how conservative Korean society is you still fight to be yourself 
Sana I’m so happy you’re smiling bright again those weeks were tough because you weren’t okay  
Nayeon nations best friend keep working hard keep smiling your vocals are insanely clean. Hard work paying off 
MOMO you keep being that happy go lucky for as long as you can, remember to rest and take care of yourself, your dancing is already top notch 
Jihyo I was so scared that “scandal”would affect you negatively but I’m so happy it didn’t. Everyone deserves happiness you keep fighting for yours. These past few comebacks you’ve been a ball of energy it’s been amazing to watch 
Dahyun the rapper with the sweetest voice you’ve been getting so much attention this comeback!!! I was beginning to think people were blind. GIRLYOUAREHOT
Jeongyeon you look stunning with long hair you look stunning with short hair it’s truly unfair. You snapped this comeback I literally screamed when I saw you during the rap part 
Tzuyu you goddess, watching the growth you’ve made from sixteen to now has been amazing. I feel like we have very similar personalities, quiet laid back comedians. Your hard work is paying off 
TWICE I haven’t been hear since the beginning but I have a feeling I’ll be here to the end. Thank you thank you thank you I know it must be difficult and tiring to give so much but we are truly grateful take breaks, sleep well, eat well, we’d rather see a little less of you than to see you unwell, take care of yourselfs and to many more years to come

Twice has improved so much over the years and you know that they have earned their fame with talent, personality, and hard work. Twice has honestly impacted me though they may just be ""a music group I listen to"". They have influenced me and so many other Onces. Through all of the hardships, you were there for each other like a family and true friends. Thank you for an amazing 4 years 😊👍✨ We all love you! ❤❤❤

My story with Twice nobody asked for:
I'm really young ATM (13), so I discovered you when I was 9. I was obsessed with the song ""Cheer Up"". I found it after listening to ""Lion Heart"" by SNSD, really the only Kpop group I knew. I was just really bored so I wanted to watch some Markiplier in my recommendedations, but instead accidentally clicked on ""Cheer Up"" (because it just came out and was similar to Lion Heart). I ended up listening to it and immediately loved it. I played it all day everyday to the point where my mom told me to shut up everytime I played it😂😂😂 I ended up listening to TT about 2 weeks after coming out and loved that one too, causing my cousin to listen to it and she still loves it to this day (same, sis). Then, a video came into my recommendations that was the reason I really loved TWICE- ""Tzuyu's Life Story Since the Beginning"". I watched all 23 minutes and I decided to check out SIXTEEN. However, I only watched for Tzuyu because she was the only member I knew 😂 I instantly fell in love with ALL of Twice. However, I originally thought that there were at least 18 members, so I was confused when there were only 16 girls in the show AND people were getting eliminated. Turns out there are only 9 😂 

After Knock Knock and Signal came out, I got a NEW favorite song- Knock Knock. Yep, Knock Knock officially beat my obsession for Cheer Up. My mom hated it even more 😂 That got my younger sister into Twice, and, so, we watched them all the time until she quit because she couldn't understand them 😂 However, instead of my love dying down, it only increased. I was like ""good luck, mother""

I still only knew 3 members- Tzuyu, Sana, and Momo. I still got the other member's names mixed up 😂 But that all changed once a certain song came out... Yeah bois, I'm talking about ""The Twice Song"". Despite that song being a funny, playful song, it really helped me with learning about Twice. I finally learned every member's names, faces, ethnicities, etc. Around this time, Likey came out and I loved it, but still loved Knock Knock. However, Likey gave me a bias list that I am still ashamed of to this day. The top of my list was Tzuyu (well, duh, she's perfect 😂) but there was another factor- I didn't like Mina at all. Omg I feel so guilty :( I thought that she was too cocky and didn't care for the other members. I realized about 3 months after about how wrong I was and I felt so bad. I'm sorry Mina and all of Once 🙏💦🙏💦🙏💦 

Another thing I discovered in Twice really changed my POV of Twice's talent- their side songs. I loved all of them and couldn't stop listening to them. Twicetagram was my favorite and I realized I could download the album on my phone for free. Of course, I did 😂 At this point, Tzuyu was still my bias, but I started taking a liking to Jeongyeon and Nayeon. Heart Shaker had come out and I still didn't like Mina. :(

Whenever Merry and Happy came out, though, my opinion changed. I started watching fan cams, reality shows with them, meet and greets, etc. I loved Mina whenever I saw a certain fancam- a fan cam of her helping her said ""fans"" yet they would insult her, causing her to cry. She took it to heart and I felt so bad. I started watching things with her in it more and I realized she's an amazing and VERY talented person ❤ She was my bias after a while as Jeongyeon and Dahyun followed. What is Love came out and I loved Twice even more. Yeah, I know. Impossible. Before I even paid attention to Chaeyoung, she was my favorite in the MV. I LOVED the yellow ball look for her AND how she did the freaky Friday scene and made it look adorable. I started paying attention to all of the members as a whole, especially Sana and Mina. I also liked Dahyun. 

At the time, Knock Knock was still my favorite MV and What is Love was my favorite album. Sana was my bias and Mina my bias wrecker. I rewatched SIXTEEN and took a liking to Jihyo. She was so talented and had such a bright personality. However, she wasn't my bias. I forgot what happened, but Chaeyoung rose to the top. I just absolutely LOVED her personality and thought she was so adorable and still do. She has been my bias ever since that click. Dahyun was tied with her and I bought a ton of things that reminded me of Dahyun until I just randomly stopped liking her as much (now I love her still, but Chaeyoung still my ultimate bias). I finally became an official Once whenever Dance The Night Away. I loved thought that it was definitely Jihyo and Chaeyoung's era because of how perfect they were. About a month earlier, I realized that they had Japanese songs (I knew about them but I thought that the songs were also Korean) AND line distributions. I started watching line distributions and got mad over them 😂 now, they are a lot more even than before but they used to be ridiculous. I learned all of the English lyrics to almost every song, even side songs (now I know every Korean and English lyric to every song 😂 don't judge). Twice made a huge change in their type of genres whenever Yes or Yes came around. I loved it the most (yet tried to convince myself that I liked Knock Knock more) out of every era. Everybody knew it was Mina's era because she NAILED it. Love you penguin 😘😘😘 

I did something I regret yet love at the same time for Halloween- I dressed up as Nayeon from Knock Knock for Halloween 😂 My mom was so done 😂 I even cut my hair like Momo. I noticed that I was a bit too in love with Twice, so I did what ever reasonable person would do- I spent over $300 on merch for them. Wait, what? That's not reasonable? Oh. My reasoning was this: everytime I bought something from someone, I stopped liking them. I tried that with Twice buuuuuut. Yeah, it didn't work. I'm glad it didn't because Twice is amazing. I did, however, manage my time watching Twice and fangirling over Twice, causing my obsessing to die down just to a mega fan, yet I still love them more than ever right now. 

Stay by my Side and The Best Thing I ever Did made me cry and love them more and BDZ was a bop. I Want you Back made me see Jihyo's talents, Stay by my Side made me love Momo more, The Best Thing I ever Did redeemed my love for Tzuyu once again, and all of their side songs made me love Twice. 

However, poor Mina's situation happened and I literally cried for, like, 2 hours straight because I felt so bad and wanted her to get better. I prayed for her every night and just really wanted her to feel better. I am SOOOOOO happy that Mina is back :) Thank you for all of Once for your help. 

Fancy FINALLY made people realize Chaeyoung's cuteness and my cousin started liking Twice. Happy Happy and Breakthrough made me fall even deeper in love with Jeongyeon and Momo. Feel Special made me love Nayeon so much more and gave MiChaeng shippers even more hope 😂 Fake and True was honestly one of the best MVs in, like, all of Know. It was extremely well done, especially when produced within a few days (like, 3 weeks) 

Thank you JYP for your amazing support and for producing perfection. Thank you ONCE for loving Twice and giving them strength. Thank you THRICE for having Twice and Once fight for what they believe in, causing us to build up even higher. And most importantly, thank you TWICE. You've inspired, built us all up, changed people's lives, caused changes for the better, and just made people happy. I may be young but I know that you're very talented. Twice will BE AS ONE ❤

My current bias list to see how far my relationship with my love for the members have come:
1. Chaeyoung
2. Jihyo
3. Mina
4. Nayeon
5. Sana
6. Jeongyeon
7. Tzuyu
8. Dahyun
9. Momo (but I still love her SOOOO much❤😘❤😘❤😘)

All popularity they have and fans, it all came from their hard work. So I recommend all the haters to watch sixteen to realize their hard work. I still can't believe I used to hate them. Their literally my favorite kpop group now. Not only kpop, but from all groups, Twice is no.1",1,2019-10-20T16:29:47Z

@maryjoypeduche4103,"I've become a Once last year (yes I'm a newbie to the fandom) I remember my classmate dancing ""What is love?"" I don't know that Twice is the one singing it and honestly i don't even know Twice because I'm not into k-pop. I became a Once when there is a mass streaming in TT mv for the 500mv views versus the aiiyl mv of bp. I don't know i just feel like i have to support this gg. There is something special about them that's making me want to support and love them. The first thing that caught my attention is Momo I lik her voice in TT mv it's soooooo cute and her hairstyle and dancing skills you can say that my first bias is Momo  (and i freaking always mistaken Sana for Momo and Momo for Sana) and honestly as I know them more better everyone is my bias. Then in recommendations I've found their episodes in Idol room, the whisper challenge, the cheese kimbap, the ""EH?!"", the ""I love you so much"" baby voice of nayeon and many moreeeeeeeee. It makes me fall inlove with them more because of their talents and especially personality. They never outshined anyone because they shine in their own ways. Then I watched their sixteen era and I saw all their hardships and it makes me more proud of them as Once. 


Happy 4th anniversary to the girl group I will forever stan. I cannot buy the albums and merchs because I'm just a student but I am willing to support you with all my heart. Thank you for being my inspiration. I love you Twice! Enjoy your day and Minari i love you so much all onces are here for you.",2,2019-10-20T16:29:06Z

@myrnasj.almenario1694,"I become a once when my best friend show me their likey mv, dna mv, and as if its you last. Then I watched some blackpink videos and the episode in idol room? when Lisa covered their song I love it and I searched them without my friend knowing it and I became a once at September 1, 2018 and I didn't regret it because they where there when I feel like there's no one at my side, when I feel happy. They are there. So it feels like if they have negetive thoughts or they are sick, I want them to feel that we are once are their for them. Twice may be not forever but they will remain in my heart forever. I hope this kind of comment help them to be positive because they need that to be the ""twice"" that we know the positive thinkersssss. I just want to share this even my grammar is wrong because I am/ we are a proud once. Thank you for being my strength TWICE.

私が精神の病気にかかってしまったとき､いちばん心の支えになってくれたのがtwiceでした。逆にこんなに胸が苦しくなったのもtwiceです。

@yuu549plo,TWICE4周年おめでとう。僕がTWICEと出会ったのは今年の4月でした。パフォーマンスの素晴らしさに感動して即日onceになりました。本当にTWICEには感謝してる。どんな困難が訪れても乗り越えられそうな気がする。それくらい人生において力になってる。これからもTWICEの活躍を心から応援しています！そしてミナの回復を心から祈ります。ゆっくりのペースで良いので少しずつ回復して仕事も少しずつ頑張って欲しい。どうも長文失礼しました。新参onceより心からのコメントでした。,0,2019-10-20T16:04:25Z

@rifkunnn,"Im just discovered Twice from Likey era, also im not person that too much like or give attention to K-pop and im not sure im even can be a fan of any boy or girl group.
But Twice make me want to more know about K-pop and South Korea,yes Twice change my perspective of life after what they've done so far especially on sixteen. Twice is the one and only idol group that i stan. Once and Twice,this fandom..ah no this family is real deal. Not even a joke,Twice really can change any person's life.

Este 2019 se cumplen 4 años y espero que se cumplan muchos más. Gracias por alegrar mis días y animarme cuando estoy triste,  cuando va algo mal o no soy capaz de luchar. Cada una de vosotras, ha entrado en mi corazón como si fuese un ángel(que lo sois) y no creo que salgáis nunca de él. Va a hacer un año desde que soy ONCE y me arrepiento de no haberlas escuchado antes y conocer el kpop. Con cada sonrisa vuestra, yo sonrio, con cada canción, me muevo(incluso me animo a bailar), cada abrazo o momento gay, me dan ganas de shippearlas(cosa que hago; viva al Michaeng, 2yeon, Dahmo, Saidahmo, Satzu. Y viva a la relación de Jihyo, nuestra DIOSA y Kang Daniel, que por cierto tienes buenos gustos Jihyo). 
JYP, déjalas descansar un poco, que se lo merecen.
 Esto lo pensé y lo dije cuando me enteré de que Mina estaba malita y tenía ansiedad; “SÍ TENGO QUE ESPERAR 1, 2, 3, 4 O INCLUSO 7 AÑOS, PARA QUE UNA MIEMBRO SE RECUPERE COMPLETAMENTE, LOS ESPERARÉ”.

@linelledutoit4380,"Nine days from now will mark my one year with twice and once. It has been an incredible journey of struggling to get to know such a large group, listening to all of their songs on end, fighting thrice and other anti's to protect my girls streaming mvs and songs as much as possible, aching whenever a member got hurt or became ill, and of course, crying when I heard of Minari's anxiety. It has been a crazy year as well but I would never trade it for anything. I love these nine girls from the bottom of my heart and i will do anything to protect them. I remember almost a year ago, when i watched a video about jeongyeon x jimin theories, and i decided to do some research. I barely knew anything about ""this girlgroup called twice"", I thought they were a group that did nothing but cutesy stuff, but then the Yes or Yes teasers came out..... and I fell in love. They seemed like an endless amount of members (me being used to 7 and under) and i felt weak whenever I thought about the fact that i'd have to learn all their names and faces. But I was already in so deep so I had pushed on. And by the time december came around I knew all of the members individually, I was so proud of myself. Obviously my bias was already jeongyeon, since i was already in love with her before i even saw the rest of twice. I will admit, at the start I was extremely annoyed by Nayeon, Mina and Tzuyu, because I thought they were entitled and selfish. I also thought Momo and Sana were ugly. I now hang my head in shame when I think about those thoughts I had. I want to slap myself, but now I love each and every one of them so much. They mean the world to me, and i will never give them up for anything. They are such a big part of my world. A smile on any of their faces make my heart flutter. Their soft and kind natures make me uwu, and their talents continue to amaze me every single day. I love you, 투와이스, and I will always be a ONCE who loves you infinitely💖",0,2019-10-20T16:00:55Z

트와이스가 노래를 더이상 안 불러도
난 트와이스가 부른 지금까지의 
노래들을 평생 들을거야.

트와이스가 해체해도 죽을때까지
트와이스의 원스(팬)가 됄거야.

난 트와이스 순위 안정할거야..
왜냐면  난 트와이스 모두를 사랑하니까..

@nanarazmy,"I remember watching vlive for Twice’s debut mv countdown. How their debut song was once ranked #99 on Melon. And look at them now. Winning countless of awards, topping various charts with their songs, and being one of kpop best girl group. These girls have come a long way. I wish that Twice will always be strong and keep doing what they love. I’m so proud of them. Although i dont follow their journey as much anymore like how I used to, but these 9 girls will always have a special place in my heart. Happy 4th Anniversary Twice! ❤️",0,2019-10-20T15:50:27Z

You know at first when I know about Sixteen around 2015... I ignored them. Because at that time I was so busy with my school. 
And because I am a wondergirls fans so I have subscribed JYP for a long time ago.
When JYP dropped TWICE teaser.. I accidentally pressed it because I thought it was wondergirls video. And It was a great accident ever in my life!!😢😢
Stanning them from their debut period is the best thing I ever did. TWICE.. be happy always and have a great great great year afterwards. Also Mina, (my bias forever!)please Avoid all of those hate comments that will bring you down. Only Spend good time and never rushed yourself to comeback 😙because we true ONCE will always patiently waiting for a stronger Minari😙. I love you TEudoongi!! Go TWICE! Go MICHAENG!

I love everything about them they are the first kpop group that I loved, cherished , and they inspired me in everything I do that I should work hard to be successful just like them and staying humble. I just wish One day that I can have a chance to see them and thank them for inspiring  not only young people but also the adult fans for giving us smile, courage . I want to thank their effort for working hard to give us best songs, for writing best lyrics, best performances. I know they are facing depressions,anxiety and I hope that they can rest too because they are human, they also feel tired . Yes I want to see them perform new song every month but it would be best to give them a break a long break. so that when they comeback they will be together.  imagine ot9 recieving music station wins, singing encore songs, having fun in fan meetings, go out to variety shows, recieving awards . I just want to see them ccomplete . ActuallyI was surprised that mina was in the 4th anniversary she was there performing, looking beautiful well all of them are😅🤷🏿‍♀️ and she looks happy no they look happy since it was the first time since mina performed with them.  ok I'll just stop over reacting😂 I just wanted to say that I am a proud ONCE and I'm Proud of how successful TWICE now .

@Sipencerita,"Satu satu nya girls group yg emng aku ikutin dari awal kisah. Padahal aku gak suka ama kpop, tapi aku penggemar berat acara variety show korea dari dulu dulu nya. Ntah kenapa tiba tiba tertarik dg acara sixteen jadi ngikutin jejak twice dari awal kisah mereka. Karna pusing ngurus kuliah juga faktor penguat nonton sixteen jadi hiburan. Liat perjuangan mereka mereka dari zero from hero. Dengar lagu like ooh aah yg bikin mood baik banget. Sampe ngikutin variety mereka. Dan karna lagu cheer up tambah cinta ama twice, sekarang twice udah jadi superstar dan gak nyangka banget. Karna gua emng gak suka kpop awalnya jadi gua gak pande cara pilih pilih bias. Karna twice udah satu raga banget. Jadi gak bisa di pilih satu satu. Dan sekarang saingan twice udh banyak. Dan jika twice suatu saat udah gak seterkenal sekarang gue tetap jadi penggemar mereka. Karna cuma twice hiburan gue disaat kesendirian. Wkwkwk. Seperti kata chaeyoung waktu mereka menang daesang pertama gue juga pengen kalian awet seperti sechkies.

@nadaalloul,"Twice and Once-for-a-lifetime. Those girls have been through a lot in these couple years. Since their debut; they've been over working, over exercising, over thinking, they were injured neither once nor twice, more than hundred times. They suffered from lack of sleep, safety, eating, just to practice and do all the things they were required to do. They sang for love, passion, humanity, dreams and relationships. They sang for adults, kids, parents. They were and still  influencers for so many people. They changed people's lives for the good. They took all the haters words and changed them to beautiful lyrics. They shared with us their favorite songs, food, games, habits. They went through ups and downs. They kept fighting to be better.   They worked harder after every single album. Words can't describe how much I personally appreciate them one by one. I hope you live a long life, you make all your dreams come true, you keep shining every day, and I hope you don't take hater's words seriously because they are just jealous of your success. They just can't do the things you did and still doing.

There is so much I love about these girls, their concept, the way that they love to perform on stage. Even if we are missing one singer #GetWellSoonMina ❤️, TWICE still helped Mina and supported her. Thank you TWICE, and thank you ONCES for encouraging them to keep making music and work harder. And best of all, thank you JYP, for forming this amazing K-POP group.

처음부터 여기 없었지만 끝날 때까지 여기 있을 거야 나는 두 번 된 것을 매우 자랑스럽게 생각합니다. 그들은 모두 최고입니다. 내가 무대에서 수행 할 사랑하는이 여자,그들의 개념,방법에 대해 너무 많은 사랑이있다. 우리는 하나의 가수#GetWellSoonMina️️ 을 누락하더라도,두 번 여전히 미나를 도와 그녀를 지원. 두 번 감사드립니다,그리고 그들에게 음악을 계속 열심히 일을하도록 격려 주셔서 감사합니다. 그리고 무엇보다도,이 놀라운 K 팝 그룹을 형성 해 주셔서 감사합니다.

@lykabuenaventura3752,"My history of being a once:
Honestly i was a basher of twice before because I don't like their cute concept and that time I'm a newbie kpopfan, I admired girlgroup who have swag concept, something like that! and I don't know why I hate twice before its just because I hate their cute concept? (fvck self) and my first impression to them is just being them cute in camera. But in dance the night away era I started to like them, I started to know them, how they start in industry, how hardworks they did, and that time I watched their sixteen episodes so I was started to like them by that time but not yet stanning twice. so at that time I felt like I was blaming myself why I hate them its  just because they have a cute concept? but no, I made a mistake when I started to recognize them and knowing their history of why they are so successful now. its just because TWICE IS SO VERY TALENTED AND HARDWORKING by themselves and the group that i hated before is the one who make my most favorite girl group list in kpop industry. Just hate myself to hate them before but yes no doubt they are TALENTED. And I'm proud to say that I'm a ONCE thankyou my OT9 and YOU MAKE ME FEEL SPECIAL🤗",0,2019-10-20T15:40:01Z

@alyssaa4241,"I never thought I would connect so strongly with any artist But then I met TWICE and everything changed, I felt close to these 9 girls, I wanted to smile when they were smiling I wanted to cry when they were crying 
I wanted to protect them from this unfair world
 I had the opportunity to see them grow, to become big, they are strong women now. and i couldn't be more proud
 During these 3 years that I am part of this family I could witness many difficult times, this year was especially difficult but I know they can go through it because besides the fans and the family they have each other, that's what attracted me, I saw how much they were connected they have such a strong and beautiful friendship, I wanted to be part of that and I'm very happy to know that I am part of that 
Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Momo, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun, Chaeyoung and Tzuyu , different personalities, different opinions, and different colors but when they are together they become one. I intend to keep following these 9 wonderful people to the end, and I am very proud to say that I am and will always be a Once.

Twice told me WHAT IS LOVE . DANCE THE NIGHT AWAY cheers me up when I'm sad. Now the THE BEST THING I EVER DID is to become a once. Twice makes me FEEL SPECIAL.

@satgojos,"_what if..._
_what if_ twice disbands with an album called ""the story ends""?
_what if_ some members of twice leave the group?
_what if_ twice became 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... 0...?

all of these may happen but twice will still be twice no matter what!

*2015 - twice debut/like ooh ahh* 
they started off as a good group.
but haters started attacking, calling them copycats, snsd ripped off.
even ""The Story Begins"" Album sales were below 900 copy.

*2016 : Cheer up & TT*
the year when twice's popularity increased, but the worst part is thrices were more powerful in this era. they would edit twice vocals to make them sound really bad which may think some once to unstan them. but twice isn't giving up. because you know who helped them? *us onces* , we protected twice as hard as we can just to tell them we love them. but twice was really successful in that year, they won their first award, their first triple crown and their first daesang.

*2017 : Knock Knock, Signal, Likey & Heartshaker*
in this year, twice were hated for their cute concept, for their kindergarten steps and for their ""bad vocals"" which it's not true. well, twice concept was actually color-pop but people would always say it's a cute concept. but us *once* protected them. haters began attacking again when twice recieved an another daesang for signal, because haters said that the song sucks. but the song is really catchy and i really like it. but twice were unbothered from the haters a.k.a thrices.

*2018 : What is love?, Dance the night away & Yes or Yes*
This year is when haters decreased and became onces too. Well, That's the power of twice. All of their hateful comments turned into good comments. they realized that there is no reason to hate twice so they decided to apologize and became a part of this family called once. this year is twice's year, they have a tight schedule but they are still hard-working just for us once. and they did recieved an another daesang again! it's their third consecutive year of recieving a daesang! but haters are salty because they became more successful again. but twice is still unbothered lmao.

*2019 : Fancy & Feel Special*
this is the another year of twice, they became more matured. they even changed their concept and killing us once with their visuals and duality. but mina, she is diagnosed with anxiety disorder during late fancy era. but now she's feeling well now. (take care our penguin) and it's their 4th year of making us happy. we're so thankful because twice didn't gave up to their dreams, and now they are sooo successful that they can have a competition with boy groups, yes, that's the power of twice music. and thank you JYP-nim for creating twice, without them, us onces will be empty. 

but in the end we knew that they will disband but twice will stay in our heart and mind.

because...
if twice has millions of fans, then i'm one of them.
if twice has thousands of fans, them i'm one lf them either.
if twice has hundreds of fans, i'm still one of them.
if twice has 10 fans, i'm still one of them.
if twice has 1 fan, then i'm the only one.
if twice has no fans, then i don't exist.

*THANK YOU TWICE*

I was so empty, like there was this hole which was impossible to fill with pretty much any emotion, I was emotionless. It took me months, years of attempt to fill up this questionable ""hole"". But not until these weird, dorky, yet talented crackheads. I found happiness, finally. They were my happiness, up to now, they effortlessly filled this gap inside of me without me even noticing, every video made me aware of what I would miss if I actually ""ended it all"", I mean they motivated me, encouraged me to wake up every single morning to finish what I've started, to be the person I'm supposed to be, and I'm not saying this just to increase onces' population, I'm saying this simply because I wanted to let you all know that 9 girls have saved me and possibly cured this ""emptiness"" I felt, and it really bums me out that they can't even notice the change they can make and how they influence most onces to continue being the person they were supposed to be. Despite all the hate, the negativity spread by those toxic anti's, they chose to keep going and to be the ""twice"" every once loves. 

I just wanted to say thank you. I didn't know 9 girls had such an impact on oneself. A short message would never be enough to express the gratitude I feel for staying with me, figuratively, I can't thank you all enough.",0,2019-10-20T15:33:23Z

@mudangayu1729,"Was studying Biology. Turned on internet to search for something.
This notification came.
I watched.
Now I'm sad.
I don't want to study anymore.
It was so unexpected.

Happy 4th anniversary Twice.
My 9 noona
My sunshine.
My happy pill.
My everything.
Look how they've grown.
They are just cute fluffy balls of positivity and happiness and talent.
Their trainee struggles and all.
They've grown soo beautifully.
Taking all the hates and turning them into their power.
Power of becoming better and better.
I can't imagine my life without them.
Sometimes I felt upset or bored about being single.
But then I found them.
Their cuteness, talent, charm, mischievousness.
And now I don't care about being single.
Because watching them just makes my day.
And all of them are so bright and lovely.
Still my ultimate bias is Mina.

Dear Mina Sharon.
I don't if it's even possible.
But if you happen to read this.
Just know that everything is gonna work out.
Literally EVERYTHING.
I just saw your picture on @twicetagram after such a long time.
And I'm sure you're getting better and better everyday.
And why wouldn't you.
You have Chaeyoung with you (I'm a michaeng shipper)
The problem seems bigger and never ending only when we're going THROUGH IT.
remember your high school test that you didn't study for.
Or you're parents vase that you broke during childhood.
Remeber how scared we were  to face the problem.
But looking back now.
They were all just naive thoughts.
And everything is sorted now.
Life will b this way always.
When you overcome your anxiety problem completely.
And after sometime you look back.
You'll realise that, that wasn't that much of a problem.
So stay strong.
My life goals is meeting Twice and Blackpink.
And of course Jeon Somi too.
It'll take while.
But I'll surely meet you.
So stay strong stay healthy stay happy.
Eat lots.
Take care of yourself and the people you love, and there'll be nothing else to sorry about.

I think I should go and study now.

I love you Twice.
You don't know what you've done with my life.
I'm forever in debt.
Take care.
Bye.

They aren’t just a girl group, but a family as well. Onces love Twice so much because they make us feel special and vice versa. I could go on and on about why I love the girls so much but I don’t want this comment to be too long lmao. Anyways, happy 4 year anniversary Twice 💕

Many years later, when I grow old, in my 60s, 70s, 80s, I might forget about them. Their faces, their voices, their dances, their personalities......

However, I would never forget that there was once these group of nine girls, however different in their characters, yet brought together with their dream to share their music with the world. Even if TWICE would not create any more music in the future, there would always be a place in my heart for them, and I would always be proud to say that I am a ONCE.♥️♥️♥️",1,2019-10-20T15:15:28Z

@reecelim8618,"It feels so damn nostalgic 😭, its already been 4 years with these girls. Every year being better than the last. Although I joined the fandom late (around early 2018), I already feel so much going through the journey with the girls. Their progress since the beginning as well as Sixteen really shows how much they have learnt and grown over the years. Geez I can't help but cry, I love these girls so much and I can not be happier to be in their fandom. I will forever stan these queens. To better years to come!

@BloodofaFool,"Happy birthday Twice. Thank you Mina for making an appearance last night and finding the strength just to say hello and cry with us. I couldn't be there but I was sending so much love. It's my first full year with Twice and I can never say I've never felt the love from a group like Twice. They are original, beautiful, sincere, talented, and funny. All the girls are gf goals but treat fans with such a kind and welcoming heart. Thank you for being with me through my darkest and loneliest time. Twice was my friend when my real friends left. Congratulations on your success. I hope we meet one day. ❤️🌹❤️🌹❤️🌹❤️🌹❤️🌹❤️🌹❤️🌹❤️🌹❤️🌹❤️

@McSkzzle,"cant believe its been 4 years already, when i recieved a notif from jyp ent saying that there was a mv and at first i was just enjoying the song but then i realised how special they were, every member shone in their own way, from that moment onwards i stayed together with them and we were one. i hope that 5 years later or when the members of twice are married or are living their own life we can still be as one.
