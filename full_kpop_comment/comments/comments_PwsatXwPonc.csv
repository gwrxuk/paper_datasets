@buttercup7009,"Topic 1: Immune to the cold but can't feel any coolness VS immune to the heat but can't feel any warmth
I'd choose the first option mainly because I'm the type who is always cold so I hate the winter and I'm always wearing long sleeves wherever I go. I am so sensitive to the cold that I get cold at home even with normal temperature. There are times where it's hot but I'd adjust to it and wear my jacket after a few minutes. If I was immune to the cold then I won't have the problem of freezing to death in the winter and I'd be able to wear any kind of clothes I want instead of wearing jogging pants and hoodies(+jacket packed inside my bag) every single day. I'm confused with the ""can't feel any coolness"" part but I'm guessing it has something to do with emotions? Like I won't be able to feel whether someone is being cold to me or vice versa. Tbh if the other party is being cold to me then I don't think I'd want to hang out with that person but if it's a love one or a close friend, then I think communication is key. I already have a resting bitch face so I get misunderstood a lot, asking if I'm mad or sad so I'm kind of used to it but if I have to understand if the other party is being cold to me then there's only 3 options: I want them to tell me what the problem is because I'm not a mind reader, we can forget about it and start the next day as if nothing ever happened, or we can just end the relationship because this obviously isn't working out. The first one is for friends, second one is for family and the third one is for romantic relationships.

This is a no-logic kind of debate but this is my realistic way of thinking lol",0,2022-10-08T05:56:04Z

@cherylg.s7920,"Okay, but like, for the first debate, I would probably go with everyone being immune to the cold, because, like, hear me out:


When you are immune to heat, yes, you wouldn't use appliances like fans, AC's, and whatnot, but that doesn't exactly end global warming, more like slow it down for a while. 

Look at it like this, why is everyone so careful around the fire? Because you can get hurt. So if you are immune to fire, you will tend to be more careless, and you need to remember that humans aren't the only things that can get burnt. So this may eventually lead to more fire-related accidents happening, and since we as humans won't get hurt, the stigma around fire-related accidents will be loosed up,  and it probably won't be seen as that big of a deal as it is when our lives are at risk. Not to mention the more burning of things will only make global warming worse.


Second, it is actually a very 'unwise' decision to ignore it when your devices are overheating, because *""When your phone is overheated, your battery will also not function as efficiently and will suffer worsened performance. The hotter the temperature, the more quickly your battery will lose its ability to store energy efficiently. Hot temperatures can also cause long-term damage to your battery.""* So being immune to heat will mean you won't be able to tell when your device is overheating and off it, so it can cool down.  This leads to damage to the device and you might have to replace the battery often or maybe even get a new device.

Then you might be able to tell when you have a fever or you might not even get fevers, which is kinda concerning if you consider the fact that the heat produced during fevers is your body heating up to fight the germs, right? but what if you can't? 

Also being able to eat all the ice cream I want whenever without getting sick is a bonus. :D",0,2021-05-19T16:32:56Z

Yoon Jeonghan — Libra, known for being balanced, charming, and beautiful.
Wen Junhui, Kwon Soonyoung — Gemini, known for being playful, curious, and extremely intelligent and witty.

Cold Immunity:
Freezing can be really unpleasant.
You can get sick with hypothermia.
Wear less clothes takes less time.

Heat immunity:
If a person is very hot, then he may become dizzy, tired and weak.
If you're hot in the summer, saving coolness may not be enough.
If you are a little susceptible to the sun, you can do without sunscreen.

@EldaBerhaneyessus-v8f,"from the standpoint of a national debater (pf, policy & ld), here's my picks for who won:
(winners will be in bold)

*Immune to Heat* VS Immune to the Cold
On a standpoint of logicality, saving people has more magnitude then feeling the warmth of human emotion. Both arguments are viable, but Jun made the incredible argument in which magnitude trumps all: being able to save people from fires.
but hoshi with the wallet had me on the floor istg.

*Teleport* VS Time Slip
from what had happened so far, I think that team teleport will win solely because of the brief statement at the beginning of their argumentation about saving transit costs by briefly teleporting to retrieve an item. I think that argument is really heavy on magnitude and feasibility.",11,2020-11-30T16:13:41Z

@jocelyngarcia5654,"My opinion is gonna be in jeonghan's side. 

Ice can be as hot as fire. If they are immune to hot that means with just a small snow can be a small fire to them. What I mean is, a cup of cold water will be equivalent to boiling water, if you are going to be immune to ice, that means they can hold a fire but they can't hold a block of ice, (fire will be an equivalent of block of ice to them) means they will be dead if winter comes. ( my opinion will only apply when you are immune to hot and dangerous to cold ) ( counter for jun's opinion )

And another thing is, all of us like hot foods but if they can't feel heat that means all of their food will be forever cold. That's not a good thing. Hot makes food taste new and enjoying, but without feeling hot makes some food boring.",0,2020-10-04T14:58:27Z

If you never realized you had a fever because you can’t feel heat, you’re less likely to know how sick you are. A lot of diseases and poisons can go undetected that way. Heat immunity is dangerous to have when the body uses fevers as an alarm system. :D",292,2020-08-21T11:46:33Z

@thddPdnjs0124,"지갑 가지러 순간이동 한다 했을 때 급 반박 논리 떠올라서 끄적여봅니다ㅋㅋㅋㅋ

순간이동은 원하는 곳으로 이동하죠. 근데 우리가 보통 뭔가를 잃어버린다면 어디서 잃어버렸는지 정확히 기억하지 못합니다. 그럼 지갑을 잃어버렸을 때, 민규씨는 잃어버린 줄도 몰랐는데 지갑을 어디서 잃어버렸는지는 어떻게 알까요?? 만약 잃어버린 것 같은 장소로 이동했는데 지갑이 없다면? 그럼 쿨타임은 10시간인데 시간을 버린 셈입니다. 위 영상에서 나온 것처럼 방송 시작 시간이 딜레이 될 수도 있고요. 만약 누군가와 함께 가지 않았다면 지갑을 못찾았는데 어떻게 다시 돌아올 수 있을까요? 대중교통을 이동하려해도 물건을 잃어버린 사람이 핸드폰결제수단을 쓰고 있지 않다면? 그럼 더더욱 시간은 늦춰져만 가는 겁니다. 그러므로  그 발언은 논리적이지 못하다고 봅니다.

With the cold side when Jeonghan said they could save the people on Everest that isn’t true because yes they wouldn’t be affected by the cold but they would be affected by the lack of oxygen which is one of the main concerns when it comes to Mount Everest,0,2020-07-08T13:24:50Z

@nursefroppy8187,"as someone who's done debates for over 4 years, i can say that this is the most proudest i've ever been when watching a debate with people who aren't trained for it.

the ones who stood out to me was; seungkwan, jun, jeonghan

seungkwan naturally has a way to speak and is really smart with his words, especially in this part: 10:20 - 10:31 he was able to deliver his words in a way that was able to fool his enemy and get them to admit/prove his point, which from my experience is really hard especially for a person like jeonghan, so mad props to seungkwan on that part! also yes im aware this is just how seungkwan normally just speaks but: i love the way how he presents his words and how he talks, from his voice and tone to his gestures, it really felt legit ksdjsk

jun is really good and super smart! i feel like most of the comments already talked about him and its pretty self explanatory. jun has his ways of making someone just stop and rethink their points because jun brings up really good points and questions.

jeonghan is really interesting to watch, he has a really nice way to present his points and the tone he uses is really persuasive, even i had to stop for a minute and just process everything. jeonghan also is really good at contradicting other's arguement and also brings up really good questions.

i also want to add that dino, minghao, joshua, and vernon has really good potential to improve and be really good at doing debates. dino and minghao bring really good points but lets others talk which makes me sniffle :(( i also had a vibe with joshua, he seems like the type to like these types of things and be really good at it! maybe its because he's shy or he just chooses not to talk, but i kinda hoped he would talk a lot more. vernon is just the same with my point with joshua, he seems like the type to be really good at these kinda of things! i also think its a disadvantage for joshua and vernon with their korean (+ minghao)

hoshi, mingyu, s.coups, woozi really made me proud! i was kinda surprised at woozi, i didn't think he would be really good at debates but he brought really good points and was able to execute them really well. mingyu and s.coups also shocked me, mingyu just like woozi- i wouldn't have ever thought he would be into/be really good at these kinda of things, im a bit upset s.coups couldn't talk that much but i understand because he is the type to let others talk then letting himself talk which is just adorable.

hoshi was nearly one of the three that stood out to me, i really liked his tone and his gestures. yes, he was joking and not being that serious in this debate (which is understandable sdkjs) but i genuinely think with a few improvements here and there i would bet that hoshi would be really good at debates. dk to me was really interesting to watch, he was entertaining to watch and i actually think he woud be really good at debates if he wanted to be.

and we cannot forget the main man himself- wonwoo, he truly shined. a queen. we stan a quen like him that can literally be so patient with svt even when they are literally yelling at each other-

anyways i know this was really long but idk have a good day, thanks for stopping by my ted talk.",1695,2020-06-16T13:57:45Z

@rosiet9990,"ok but, even if you're immune to heat, that just means u don't feel the sensation, that won't stop you're body from being physically burnt. same goes with cold. thing is, most people are way more likely to get a burn of some sort over frostbite, meaning being immune to heat the more dangerous one, especially when cooking and eating. when cooking, you never cook something that could give you frost bite, if u were holding ice, it'd eventually melt, not give you frostbite. the same cannot be said for heat. also, small burns can be hard to spot as well, where as frostbite would be pretty obvious. 
on the other hand, if we are talking money wise, like heating and air con, air con is way more expensive, and if u have a shit ton of blankets and clothes, you can survive a cold room. 
altho, what id wonder, is if they r immune to warmth, but can still feel coldness, they still have varying temperature ranges. they would just have a different heat gauge. they'd prefer to live somewhere colder, as they can tell temperature changes. there's a lot more places to live in the world who get cold flushes over those that are mostly heated.

Lots of love for you, Moon Junhui! 

I wonder was Dino drinking just because he likes it, or he wants an escape from something. Dino, alcohol can damage your brain because of how hard it is the impact. Please try not to drink it to much, unless you drunk on juice, milk, tea, or coffee. But not too much. Everything that is too much isn't good either. Believe me, you are precious Dino!

@Misoraaauninininiii.,"y'know I'd prefer being immune to cold, why? Well you can only have so many clothes on while still being able to move properly. What if you are hiking and a wild bear runs after you? You can't run away fast enough from that if you are bundled up too much. 
Also sun burn comes from the sun, I can just use an umbrella when I am outside. Or sunscreen, they never said that sunscreen wouldn't work. Also I already burn easily because of my pale skin so I don't go outside when it's hot too much so I wouldn't have to worry about it. Just think of this scenario: you are ice skating on a frozen lake, the ice cracks and you fall in and if you are immune to heat you will get frostbitten right away but if you were immune to cold you'd be able to escape. 
Therefore, cold is better. ThaNk you fOr listening to my ted talk.",1,2020-06-05T19:38:55Z

@bananagirl3844,"for the first topic I think being immune to heat is better, mingyu was right when you're cold you can add more layers as you want but when you're you can't just take all your clothes off plus if you're outside that's expose you more to the sun which will make it worse, heat generally wouldn't be good not good for skin not good for hygiene and def not good or sleeping, i cannot sleep when it's hot and we sleep faster and easier and better in low temps, not to mention the mental effect it'll have and c'mon you can't beat playing with fire! 
for the second topic while teleporting is cool but it could be very dangerous, everyone has haters and as idols they're already exposed to sasaengs, imagine your hater teleports right to you could kill you and goes back in  10 seconds, also what's cool abt time slip is you can avoid ever losing in rock paper scissor and we all know how important that is to survive tasks in svt  lol you and even if you goo to the futur it's only a 10% chance you can use time slip again, if you mess up on stage you can go back and do it right, and for everyday situations imagine all the embarrassing moments undone, slipping in a public place, giving wrong answers in class it's just more practical, and that's my take on the topics.",0,2020-06-04T01:29:15Z

1:56 [Mingyu : Saying some random things]
4:07 [Drank yogurt]
5:46 [You can bottoms up a hot bowl, and get applauded by other customers in the restaurant]
7:41 [Undutiful son 1] [Undutiful son 2] [Pigeon 1]
7:51 [Representing the pigeons]
10:49 [Not listening to serious talk]
11:37 [You can hold a roasted sweet potato really calmly, and look swag]
11:45 [Being hypnotized]
13:29 [Calculating the worth of his wallet]
13:39 [His pose is weirder]
(at 13:59 I'm pretty sure Hoshi is rifling through Mingyu's wallet and at 14:03 he's laughing at Mingyu)
14:03 [Vitamin expert] followed by 14:12 [Boogi expert]
14:50 [Finished calculating his wallet's worth]
15:10 [Mingyu (CEO with 2.3 billion won) - Note: Doesn't have money to buy sweet potato]
20:24 [I don't care for anything but the wallet] 
20:52 [a.k.a. Chance to find the wallet]
21:08 [Mingyu (CEO with 2.3 billion won) - Characteristic : No money to buy sweet potatoes, no wallet]
(Dino's face at 21:58 is worth noting)
23:04 [Previous owner of Cuckoo]
24:14 [A sir who controls time]

Further they asked which team we""ll support. I'll go with the theam kikikikikikikiki both ways beacause sure as hell without feeling the warmth no one can deliver the best of their emotion to anyone closer to them. and teleportation  well i guess you can just help anyone like the operations or not that level then just old people around you. 3 seconds of past or future is a bit less of the time.

It is evident that Jeonghan, Hoshi and The8 think quickly and the members help each other to make their arguments stronger. So much that those silly banters would become a good rebuttal. On the other hand, Team Hold Up is good at presenting the advantages and salient  points in their topic. Junhui really shined on this part, he makes good rebuttal and always added advantages and examples that are beneficial to their side. 

P.S. In the first topic , I really think that warmness of the environment has more disadvantages rather coldness. In winter, the person sleeping next to you will be like warm pack giving you more heat, but in summer, it will be another body with 37 degrees heat next to you. Winter will be much bearable due to technological advances and clothes.",0,2020-06-02T03:58:16Z

@phoenixsky1264,"(I'm sorry my science-loving self went off, I'm on Hold Up's side for immunity to heat)
As someone who cares deeply about climate change I have to go with Hold Up's arguement for being immune to heat, both for the sheer mention of it, thank you Seungkwan, and (someone can correct me on this because I'm working off stuff/memory I learned like 2-3 years ago) also because a/c is really bad for the environment due to cfcs (greenhouse gases basically) and whatnot and also opening windows is only effective to a certain extent, but there are green ways to heat your home >> electrical heating running off green energy sources.  But science-ing aside, I agree with Mingyu's arguement on clothes, you can put on layers for the cold but in the heat you can only take off so much (like it's been 26°C-ish here and I want to crawl out of my skin but I can't). Also concentration is negatively affected in the heat, so being immune would be useful when working.",0,2020-06-01T23:19:45Z

@es-do1xd,I think being immune to heat would be better. The main reason is that one would be able to save many people/animals as a fire fighter (just as Jun said). Obviously there are also some cases when someone is in danger in a very cold place but this occurs way less than fires. The only places I can think of are in the mountains/north/south pole but saving someone in the mountains requires more way more skill than just being immune to cold and there are barely any people living in the north/south poles.,0,2020-06-01T17:46:50Z

@cherryvt4815,"The topic was really good. However, I had to read the eng-sub as fast as I can. WAHAHAHAHAHAH...

Anyway, JUNHUI ...!!!! I'm soooo proud of you! One thing I like about when it's his turn. I got excited to hear is opinion. His conclusions are on point. I can say, Jun stans out more in this episode. 

I would also like to highlight Jun. 
Some carats think he looks so immature, and a playful weirdo type. But when he gets serious. Guys! I tell you. He is very a different person. We all know that Jun can speak korean fluently but sometimes he can mispronounce some words. The reason why he doesn't talk that much bcoz he's just listening and observing. And sometimes he had this thoughts but can't express coz people who are watching this, especially in korea will misunderstood him. But for the show he tried his best. He knew he is good at this. And If you want to know him more. You can search more about #JUN. Especially when his getting along with his Chinese friends. So you can also easily spot the difference. All I know, he's very comfortable, and when he do weird stuffs or joking around. They find him very funny and cool. While ( i just dont want to drop their names coz some carats might get offended when it comes to their biases, so i dont want some fights) what I'm trying to say, some members can't get along Jun's jokes and weirdness. And their reactions towards him are not that good. So some of the fans of JUN thinks that some members doesn't like him. And they felt offended in behalf of Jun. But please, don't misunderstood that. JUN know's more about his team, and he can handle himself. So how you feel for him. Surely, he felt that too. Maybe he just laughed at it bcoz cameras are everywhere. But I don't think
He is ignorant or numb about what's happening.  I believe he knows that. And what matters to him. They are family, they care for each other, maybe fight sometimes, or teasing around. But they love one another. 
 So just leave it like that. ^^  

Oh soo sorry. This is very long.

@rxargyros2137,"Did they ask us to choose which is better in this Comment section ?? If yes, this is my answer ...
Honestly, I would prefer Immune to The Heat. Cuz you already know that, how about when you go to countries with tropical weather for your concert tour, when it's summer, but you only stay for 2 to 3 days, so your feelings might not be so hot, or 'Ah this is just for 3 days, I'll be right back home' and you can still turn on the Air Conditioner in your room, I mean your stress only for 3 days. But we who live in this kind of country feel stressed all day in the summer! Sometimes I hope it will snow at that time. FYI Cuz during summer, the weather will be very hot from sunrise to sunset. Even at night it will still be a little hot. But when it's winter, even though I'm cold I still like it, cuz I can still sleep soundly wearing a blanket and lighting the fireplace. But if it's summer I will be very upset cuz it's still hot when going to sleep at night, it's very easy if I have an Air Conditioner but I don't have it, cuz the price is very expensive😢😂😂

And about Jeonghan-oppa's words about Antarctica, Polar Bears, and Mount Everest, in my opinion as a human being even though I feel very hot and very stressed, I will not go far there just to neutralize my burning sensation and my stressed mind so that I meet the dangerous Polar Bear, even to climb Mount Everest alone, I have no interest. Cuz it's dangerous, even if you stand the cold doesn't mean you will be friends with the Polar Bear, and it's fine to be on Mount Everest alone. NO! Besides that, the cost would be very expensive to go to Antarctica, I would fail to become a CEO like Kim Min Gyu..😢😂😂

This content is very interesting, You guys are like salesmen who make me consider both, and finally choose.😅😅",0,2020-06-01T16:49:22Z
@mirla4850,"Because Wonwoo want our opinion about this argument so, 

I cant be too cold and also cant be too hot.. So i dont want to immune in any of those immunity.. 🙂 thank you next ❤️

I'd like to choose teleport ❤️ because people tend to forget something.. Like u sometimes will forget to bring book to school,  so in other to not being scold by ur teacher u can just teleport to ur home and take ur book.. This will save a lot of time,petrol and energy.. But if u travel time for 3sec, and couldn't find where ur book it will just waste ur time.. 3sec is a short time.. U barely do anything..

@jeviely,"As a fellow debater that had been participating in a lot of debate competitions, in my opinion, the winner for tonight's debate is Hold Up Team. My reason is Moon Junhui's sexy brain support his team for a win.

Since the 1st Debate Night, I acknowledge Jun as a good debater. The way he delivers his arguments or rebuttals is good and unexpected. I'd give him the 2nd or 3rd speaker position in real debate.

By the way he delivers his rebuttals, I can see that this man is capable to turn the table and trying to take the opposite team's arguments as his advantage to attack back. The backlashes that the opposite members are saying are being pointed out by him. I can tell that he's a quick thinker, that's why I dare to say that he would make a good 3rd speaker (3rd speaker needs the ability to think fast and can do multiple  tasks at the same time, which are: listening to your opponents, writing down points, and thinking of rebuttals).

While Jeonghan, I can't say that he's that good, but I can surely say that he has potential. He listens to what the opposition team says. And, he has the confidence and that's really important in the debate world. But his arguments and rebuttals, in my opinion, are sometimes weak and backlashes his team. And that's bad because the Hold Up Team has Jun to point out his backlash. But I have to admit that he's persuasive, he just need to be more polished.

Anyways, I'm expecting a lot for the next episode of this 2nd Debate Night. Good job, Seventeen for always entertaining us, CARATs. Thank you.",491,2020-06-01T16:23:02Z

@kimmingyu8491,"*CARATS ATTENTION !!!*

Seventeen will make a comeback on June 22. 
Carats we are a huge fandom. We are that fandom who sold out 1M for an ode, we are that fandom who had the second most sold out kpop album of 2019, We are that fandom who sold out 4 domes under 24 hours that holds up to 55 thousand seats. We should not be struggling so much when it comes to vie₩s. 
Seventeen always works so hard for us and gives us the best content and it's our turn to show them how much we love, support and care about them. It's our turn to show them that they're special and important to us.

*PLEASE READ THIS COMMENT, EVEN IF IT'S TOO LONG*

*HOW TO STRE@M-*

*DO'S-*
•make sure you're log in onto your account.
•make sure your search and watch history is not on pause.
•search for the mv on your title bar 
•watch the video on 480p or 720p 
•like the video
•make sure your volume is 50+ 
•after you're done watching the mv, watch other seventeen music videos for about 10 minutes and then come back to stre@m the new mv.

*DONT'S-*
•Do not skip ads, yes even if it's 3 minutes long. Do not skip it.
•Do not skip the video, watch it without skipping.
•Do not clear your watch and search history.
•when you comment, censor the words ""stre@m"", ""stre@ming"" and ""vie₩s"".
•Do not use emojis.
•Do not press the replay button.

*Step by step-*
•make sure you're log in onto your YouTube account
•make sure your search and watch history is not on pause.
•search for the mv on the title bar
•do not skip ads
•make sure the volume is 50+ and the quality is 480p-720p
•like the mv
•watch the mv without skipping
•do not press the replay button
•after you finish watching the new mv, stre@m other seventeen music videos for about ten minutes and then come back to stre@m the new mv.
•Do not clear your search and watch history

*Another option-*
You can create multiple accounts to stre@m. So in between those 10 minutes you can switch from an account to another account to stre@m the new mv.

Thank you so much if you have read this long ass comment lol. 
Let's unite, let's stre@m very hard this time.
*CARATs our goal is more than 10M vie₩s within the first 24 hours, I believe we can do this for our SEVENTEEN. Let's get it.*

If you have any other question regarding stre@ming, feel free to ask. I'll try my best to respond.

*Let's stre@m hard and show seventeen that we love them a lot*

*stre@ming shouldn't be frustrating, it's fun because after all you'll be doing it for seventeen.*",2,2020-06-01T15:59:06Z

@audreydym,"안녕하세요. 이 글을 보실 분이 있을지 없을지는 잘 모르겠지만 글을 남깁니다. 저는 자카르타에서 사는 커럿인데요. 여기서는 거의 맨날 덥습니다. 학교에서 집에 돌어오는 길에 항상 친구과에 대화는 이거 빠질 수가 없습니다. 더운 날씨. 맨날 더워 죽겠어요. 그래서 우리는 집에 돌아가는 길에 항상 상상을 해봅니다. 날씨가 조금이라도 시원하다면 얼마나 좋을까? 혹시 가을과 겨울에 살면 더 좋을까? 왜냐하면 더우면은 어쩔 수가 없는 것 같아요. 민규오빠 말씀하신 것처럼, 더울 때는 한계가 있어요. 실내에서 에이컨이라도 틀 수 있지만, 밖에서는 거의 답이 없는 것 같더라고요. 그냥.....더워요. 추우면은 그래도 껴 입을 수가 있으니까요. 승관이가 말하는 것처럼, 더우면 가만히 있어도 더워요. 그리고 더우면 스트레스를 받아요. 그래서 맨날 더우니까 스트레스를 얼마나 받겠어요. 그래서 저는 더위 면역을 더 탐 나네요.

그리고 저는 초능력을 가질 수 있다면 항상 순간이동을 갖고 싶었거든요. 여기가 차가 엄청 막혀서 어디로 갈 때마다 거의 1-2시간씩 정도 걸려요 (출퇴근 합쳐서 3-5시간씩ㅠㅠ). 그래서 목적지 도착하기 전에 벌써 지치고 힘들어요. 이동시간이라도 줄이고 싶어서 미치겠어요ㅠㅠ 그런데 여기서 순간이동은 제가 상상했던 순간이동이 아니었네요 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 거의 쓸데가 별로 없네요 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 그래서 저는 타임슬립이 더 설득 당한 것 같네요 ㅋㅋㅋ 

오늘 주제가 개인적으로 와 닿았던(?) 것 같아요 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 제가 평소에 상상하고 생각했던 거라서 보는 내내 끄덕끄덕하면서 웃었어요. 약간 저기 어디 구석이라도 껴주고 싶었어요 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

좋은 콘텐츠를 만들어주셔서 항상 고마워요. 오늘도 힐링을 받고 갑니다. 특히 요즘 영어자막뿐만 아니라 인도네시아자막까지 넣어주셔서 너무 재미있게 봤어요! 자막도 너무 예쁘게 딜아주셨어요!!",0,2020-06-01T14:37:54Z

나는 네가 적어도 우리 아랍 캐럿들이 이해할 수 있도록 아랍어 자막을 열일곱 번 째에 붙이기를 간절히 바란다.

배려해줘서 고마워.

Thank you for always giving us a lot of content for seventeen but of course all of you know that seventeen isn’t just a kpop group, they're already international artists which have international fans too and they keep growing.

I highly hope that you would put arabic subtitle on going seventeen at least for us arabs carats  to understand.

I really wish that his stylist could keep this on forever LOL XDDDDDDDDDD It's also great that he's starting to speak a lot because honestly doesn't mean that he's not talkative means he knows nothing. He's actually the wisest in their group and manliest if you're a fan and have been watching them you know what I mean. He had his own struggles and doesn't really talk about it much because he prefers his bright side and that is also the reason why others view him as weird but very adorable. I guess Hit the road ep 13 is really his and I wish for once he could talk about his real concerns or problems not trying to pry into his life. It's his privacy and I respect it and I certainly wish others would as well but surely wouldn't hurt to see him actually saying what he feels. I kind of see my father in him which is why I know he's gonna be a really great one in the future but still kind of worried if he'd always just stand by the sideline quietly and shower all of us with his grace and love.

웃다가 정신차리니까 다음에 또만나요네
우선 플디 영상팀 고셉 피디님들
제가 정말 온마음다해 존경하고 사랑합니다
도대체ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
저런 드립은 어디서 나오는거래욯ㅋㅎㅋㅎㅋㅎㅋㅎㅋ
또 짤 한가득 주워가겠고만

1. 더위면역 Vs 추위면역
일단...나는.....
7월에 태어났고... 땀이 많고.. 다한증이 있고...
더운거 싫어하고... 에어컨 틀어놔도 땀흘리고 ㅎㅋㅎㅋㅎㅋ
열이 많아서 홍삼도 먹으면 안되는 사람이라
더위면역이 좀 있었으면 좋겠어요🤭🤭
솔직히 추우면 입으면 되는데
덥다고 벗을순 없자나...😅😅
그래도 우리 멤버들은 다 주세요
추운날 무대의상입고 딸기코로 무대하고
추운 촬영장에서 핫팩끼고 촬영하지 않게
해 강한 날 긴 촬영시간에 틈틈히 썬크림 못발라 타지않게
더운 여름에 무대해도 탈수로 힘들지 않게
더위면역도 추위면역도 다가져가라🤗🤗얍

2. 10초 순간이동 Vs 3초 타임슬립
상대적으로 10초 순간이동이 위험요소가 적어
국장님이랑 회의하다가 말실수를 했어
3초 뒤로가려다가 앞으로 가봐....(오마이갓)
근데 내가 회사에 뭐 놓고와서 순간이동을 했어
못돌아 오더라도 택시타고 집에 올수 있잖아?
내 의도대로 사용되지 않더라도
10초 순간이동이 위험요소가 훨씬 적다 이말이야
그리고 순간이동 했다가 안돌아오면?
그냥 도라에몽 어디로든문마냥 가고싶은데로 간거다 이말이야
(사실 공짜로 여행가고싶음 ㅍㅍㅍ)

그래서 나는 더위면역과 10초 순간이동에 한표!!!!

정말 논리나잇 너무 레전드야 너무재밌어
다음주 2편도 기대할게요~🤣🤣🤣

(그리고 피디님들 옛날에 런닝맨 보시면요
겁많은 유재석씨 스카이다이빙시키려고
4D라고 거짓말하고 헬기태운 몰카있는데
약간 역몰카로 리얼이라하고 4D체험을 노려보시는건

@sorewasore9730,"Logic Night season 2 is basically just Logic Night season 1 but with more 'personal' attacks XD Aight I'll edit this comment later to share which team I am more persuaded by for both topics (but will you guys really read this? Oh well I'll just do it for fun, for those who will read it if they're interested in my point lol)
*Topic 1: Immunity towards Heat vs Immunity towards Cold*
I support: *Immunity towards Heat*
If I were to be truthful, I think a person can be persuaded by either team based on where they live/ the kind of weather that exists in their area. So for someone who lives in a region with tropical weather, naturally for me, I was more easily convinced by *Hold Up* group's arguments
- All year round tropical weather would mean that the degree of coldness I would feel during October to March would be way different than say someone who lives somewhere with four seasons :D Also this immunity may probably be a blessing in disguise for you if you live in Australia too, since summer there takes place in in the middle of October to March :D
- (Ace Moon Junhui you have won me!) To have immunity towards heat, where one can't sweat easily is appealing to someone like me who sweats easily and is concerned about my appearance in public and my financial spending. Sweating less also means spending less time managing laundry and instead use that time for other matters. 
- Also this may be gross of me to mention (but nevertheless it is still logical), the inability to sweat easily (due to the heat immunity) can be compensated by other methods to eliminate bad stuff from the body (though I have to admit that this probably means more frequent toilet trips in daily life XD)
- I am someone who frequently needs to help my parent in the kitchen these days, and she would always nag about my clumsiness when cooking sometimes. I guess if I had the heat immunity my family wouldn't need to worry about me accidentally getting burnt from the stove or hot pots and pans when I'm in the kitchen or handling hot food :D
- HECK YEAH, HEAT IMMUNITY FOR REDUCING GLOBAL WARMING!!! 
- Wow by Hold Up's logic, having heat immunity means you are an ideal candidate to be firefighters //point acknowledged...//
- It may be a materialistic argument, but Mingyu has a point about how this ability allows one a valid reasoning for the need buy quality and good-looking coats (and clothes) to survive the winter :O",0,2020-06-01T13:44:32Z
