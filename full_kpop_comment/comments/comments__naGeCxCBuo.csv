I'd like to add on this one.

That's true, and we should always remind ourselves that *it's okay to see happiness as a good thing, but don't value happiness as a good thing* bcs then, you will start to chase it.

@Koed313,"This episode was so nice. I would love to sit and have a chat with Minghao, they just feel so genuine and heartfelt. It would be right up my alley.

Having said that, I also wanted to say something unrelated here so don't mind me. I really, really loved the lightning during the third rounds in Dino, DK, Minghao and Joshua, Hoshi and Vernon's rooms. It was such a mood and even made their conversations seem so much cosier. And if and when I get my own place, that's what the setting I would want to be for my bedroom. I really really love those kind of lights, the dim but bright enough, yellow illumination with ac on and some peaceful quiet. I absolutely love bright lights but those (above-mentioned) are totally my vibe too.",1,2023-06-27T03:59:36Z

@debonairepan4192,The8 saying finding happiness in the program that it doesn't come to him naturally. Finding it means you can't see it now - so his not happy with the program at the moment but will find happiness in small details. That's... sad. Hoshi working so hard even during breaks - that's so relatable to me. Good one Soonyoung❤,0,2023-06-23T23:15:12Z

@azurechanel,"The conversation between Minghao and Soonyoung meant so much to me to hear. It was so deep and serious, and that’s something I really appreciate about The8. He’s deeply introspective, but he also reads others well — especially the members — and he has this gentle way of getting to the core of what you need to hear. I also really love seeing Hoshi in moments like this, because it’s a reminder that there’s a lot of ambition, dedication, focus, and thought behind his sunny, energetic persona (and I love all of it 😊)",2,2023-06-16T07:10:17Z

@randomstuff3542,"The last part got me teary-eyed. Felt like Minghao was talking to me. I think a lot of us can relate when it comes to wanting excellent results that we often miss out on the joy of the process itself and ignore other aspects of life.  As a design student, I always feel overwhelmed and easily burnt out because I tell myself I'm not good enough and I need to work harder. Thus, putting pressure on myself when designing to make it perfect. In the end, I don't enjoy the design process which is what I'm actually passionate about. I've had time to reflect on myself and it's like I'm just existing for the sake of existing and not actually living which is something I wanna change. So, Thank you Minghao for letting Hoshi hear what he and the rest of us needed to hear.",4,2022-09-28T13:25:01Z

The car rides were also fun to watch, Gyu and Vernon just taking naps they deserve, and especially Minghao and Hoshi's talk about happiness, resting/relaxing and work-life-balance.

@dotdotdot...176,"- it's so hilarious how they seem tipsy/act drunk after drinking just water or the non-alcoholic versions of drinks 
- I love how playful and active Woozi was in this episode, really cute, endearing and entertaining
- 3D team (Dino, DK and ""Dee8"") is so funny
- Mingyu, Wonwoo and Coups are literally the rappers yet big ballad fans so it was perfect for them to end up together 
- Vernon going to see an animated movie but there's mostly little kids is very relatable
- Josh being shocked at a fan being born in 2007 is also very relatable; I'm still young but that makes me feel old lol
- I enjoyed all the skits from DK and Dino to Jeonghan and Woozi, I love that in this universe Woozi has a daughter Iseul lol
- The Jun impressions were hilarious, especially when he impersonated himself and the call with Jungwoo seemed really wholesome and cute 
- Minghao and Hoshi's heart to heart really touched me... I too am trying to find happiness in the simple things 
- to be honest it's kinda sad that Dino doesn't know the standard for his age, since he's been in the spotlight as an idol since so young he doesn't experience what the average person his age feels like",226,2022-09-08T23:57:04Z

@Ateezmultikpopstan,I love the serious talk between Minghao and Hoshi about finding happiness and Hoshi needing to rest when he has time off work and not just work all the time. I wonder if Minghao is meditating because that is when I learned about opening my heart and enjoying the moments and breathing to stay in the moment. I love their friendship,2,2022-09-08T23:11:33Z

Team Dino: Has mafia vibes and trying hard to get drunk but to no avail.

Team S.coups: The singers.  Mingyu being the drunken puppy, Wonwoo just being Wonwoo and S.coups laugher is just so healing.

Team Jeonghan: Fake maknae June and his famous aegyo, Woozi the actor. And as always if there's Seungkwan and Jeonghan there is always FUN!

@camillac.5695,"I had a really tiring day today at school so I came home and felt so happy to see a new Going Seventeen episode, and after watching it I feel reenergized and ready to study and do homework. I’m seriously so thankful to all the members, they put in so much hard work, passion, and overall effort into what they do and I respect them so much for it. At the end when Hoshi was talking to Minghao about some of his current concerns and troubles I couldn’t help but wish I could give him a warm hug him, he’s such a hard worker and doesn’t take many breaks, I hope he can find comfort and peace I hope he can rest and most importantly I hope he knows that he’s enough and amazing just the way he is. I appreciate all of the members so much, I also admire them, I’m so glad that I got to see them in concert recently as it was one of the most memorable and precious moments to me. I hope carats continue to show their love to the members, all 13 of them need to know how much carats love, appreciate, and respect them for all that they do. 💗",5,2022-09-07T23:28:59Z

@karv02,"things to keep it with you :
""You can't give up without trying""
""If you chase happiness , you won't find it""
""Don't get excited because you'll be disappointed""
-To see the result of your hard work , you need to rest.
- If you want to improve yourself , you need to stop and start again. 
Things you can relate to :
""The world keeps going after all""
""I still don't feel like I'm an adult"" 
- If you want to give up, if you struggle, you should know that the world will not wait for you, time flies and will never come back
 -Living a hectic life, don't make you feel like growing up

The8 is quiet, very observant but his words are full of truth. I believe that I, as well as other people who saw this Gose felt identified with Minhao's words.

@karenceciliano8413,"Watching this after yesterday's concert feels heartwarming. I have a newfound love for these guys! I may never meet them personally, but I am cheering for them as if they were my friends or siblings! Minghao, you are so right - chasing our personal happiness means so much, even if it's found in the stillness of time. I've learned that from making sense of reality over these past two years. Like Wonwoo, I also don't feel my age yet - I will be 25 next month, but it feels like I'm still 21/22. But maybe age isn't something to focus on, but personal growth. No matter the position or career in life, we must find that internal joy to be truly fulfilled. Thank you Seventeen for being true to yourself in this world of make-believe and pretentiousness. My heart and mind feel right after watching your content and listening to your music. You did amazing yesterday - the last day of your NA tour, and I want to say that I am proud of you and admire your hard work and humility which is constant no matter where you go!

@devlinadas3686,"I conencted with Dino and Wonwoo the most, because first of all I am the same age as Dino and I am the younger sibling, I just got a job and today I finished my first month at work and got my payment and believe me, I realized that I need to grow up now, I still myself as a 17 year old just like Dino said...but somehow, time has always been flying for me, my 15 years of school seemed to finish in a jiffy, so did my college, and now I am working...
Guys, try to live like Minghao as you grow up...I also agree with the others that the ones born after 2001 seem so odd to someone who was lucky to be born at the last moment of the 20th century...being a teacher it was really odd for me on the first day that the children were born 4-5 years after I was born...

@비유-s4h,"요즘 고잉에 아쉬운점이 많아 댓글 남겨요.
저번편까지만해도 2탄을 기대했는데 도히려 실망이 많은화였어요. 물론 좋았던 장면이나 대화들도 많았지만 그만큼 아쉽고 실망인 부분이 커지는 것 같아요. 승관이의 의도가 그렇지 않다는것 그리고 타 지인분도 그렇겠지만 외국인 멤버의 당사자와의 오케이 사인이 있었다고해도 보는 시청자 입장에선 충분히 불편하고 도를 넘었다고 생각할 수 있는 사안이라고 생각합니다. 고잉정도면 이제 자컨을 넘어서 꽤나 유명해진 하나의 컨텐츠라고 생각 되는데, 이런 사적이고 문제가 될 요소는 충분히 사전에 편집하고 자꾸만 화자되는 이야기들에대해 경각심을 가져야 한다고 생각합니다. 이번화와 별개로 계속 사회적 이슈나 자꾸만 도를넘는 발언이 종종 눈에 띌정도라면 그건 문제겠죠?
계속 쉬쉬하며 덮어주던 시절이 아니란건 모두가 알고 있잖아요.

@karitthasun290,"I have to give it up to the Going Staff team. At first, I thought the concept of a company dinner with no alcohol, filmed in the middle of the day would be the most awkward content ever produced. There were some moments that I went ""Eek... this could be more awkward than the Carnival"". But after finishing both episodes, I was like this is so raw and so nice. I got to see new sides to the members and even get to hear behind-the-scenes, the everyday life of Seventeen when they meet up with each other. I get to see: 
-  different expressions of Wonwoo in this episode
- the cute 3-poses from Jun
- the raw and caring side of The8
- the humble and reflective side of Hoshi as he listens to The8 even though he's the older one
- the easily drunk-on atmosphere Mingyu
- the skit-lovers Jeonghan and Woozi
- Seungkwan and his friendship with NCT
- Dino and his growing confidence and cheerfulness
- Joshua and his preference for movies over dramas
- the favorite playlist of Scoups - Tattoo
- Vernon and his insights into movies especially on Inception - I'm going to watch it to see the ring 
- of course, how much I would love to have drinks with DK - mood maker, deep listener, empathizer, reliable friend. I have got a whole POV of what can happen when we drink together LOL",2,2022-09-07T14:05:29Z

I do notice that whenever it's the two of them there's always that gentle warm feeling (not saying that you can't see that on other members), like on their In the Soop episode where Hoshi asked Minghao to explain the book he's reading, it's just so precious.

고잉도 진짜 아이돌이 한다기엔 너무 예능같고 재밌음레전드 장면도 많고 다른 사람들도 고잉안다는게 너무 신기하고 기분 좋고 그럼.. 😆 아이돌인데 이렇게 재밌고 실력도 좋은 아이돌중에 세븐틴이 가장기억에 남았던거 같음.. 앞으로 오래 캐럿하고 싶고 팬이 아닌 타팬였을때도 세븐틴이라는 그룹을 알았고 그만큼 얘들이 연습생 부터 지금까지 열심히 해준다는게 너무 좋음.. 멤버들 개인도 색다르고 케미도 좋고 대뷔초 영상볼때마다 뭔가 좀 뭉클함.. 점점 성장하는 세븐틴보면 언제나 행복한모습 보여서 뿌듯함 😢 서로 의지하고 항상 캐럿생각하는것도 눈물남.. 오늘 고잉도 재밌게 볼께 보는중이지만 벌써 다음주가 기대된다 히히
