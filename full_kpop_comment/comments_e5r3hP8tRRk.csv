I was worried when he made the formal apology at the police station and I am even more concerned about the extreme language he is using in this letter....it's too much. I pray for his mental health.  I pray that all the members of BTS are fully supporting him as best they can and that none of them feel he has hurt their name.  I don't know who pushed him to do the formal apology at the police station....I was shocked that he complied.....but he must be deeply in pain to write this letter and I am very concerned.  I'm praying that the August D we know....appears.,20,2024-08-25T18:17:33Z,UgyIbwFDzaJtP7OwJbN4AaABAg,0

Yoongi: riding a scooter that a 12 yr-old can ride no license required) with a helmet & on a sidewalk; tripped on a sharp turn & fell
JT: argued with police officers at the scene
Yoongi: apologetic to police & to fans
JT: smug-looking on mug shot
Yoongi: head bowed on pictures
JT: 5 days later, perfomed at a concert; no apologies
Yoongi: 20 days later, still being villified by K-media, antis & haters

I know Yoongi‚Äôs scooter thing has already been talked to death. 

However, there is a detail that I‚Äôve not seen anyone talk about yet, and it might change the perspective for some folks. 

Yoongi wasn‚Äôt just out getting wasted on any random Tuesday‚Ä¶.  I think it‚Äôs more than coincidence that the incident happened Aug 6th.  Because, August 6th was the half-way point for his service.  

I think he was celebrating a milestone with friends, like anyone would.  It was late, he had to go to work in the morning‚Ä¶and so he took the scooter instead of walking.  Not that he needs an excuse to have a drink with dinner (and I also understand that this doesn‚Äôt excuse breaking a law), but I think the context might make the whole thing more relatable for some folks‚Ä¶

Anyway, I‚Äôm sharing my thoughts in the hopes that folks with a big platform, like yourself, might add this idea to the narrative (I know we don‚Äôt know it to be fact, but it seems like an awfully big coincidence otherwise‚Ä¶)

Please share if you feel similarly.

As this goes on and on, I‚Äôm becoming concerned about how this will probably haunt him for years to come.  Will he stop drinking in public out of fear?  Will we loose Suchwita because of the link to drinking?  Will they ALL have to revert to early days attitudes of pretending that they don‚Äôt drink because it might upset someone‚Ä¶?  I‚Äôm not concerned specifically about the alcohol part of this, but what it represents as a whole.  After all this time, any one of them feeling like they need to hide part of themselves (more than the things that they just keep private because they want to)‚Ä¶ the thought makes my heart hurt.",0,2024-08-27T00:23:46Z,,0

Now I have a question though. What ever happened to the baseball player who was actually in a freaking car accident? I don't hear anything about him. It's like they just took everything about him and put it aside because they are too damn no good. They have no time for him because they are too stuck on an accident that happened in front of his house. 

I'm getting so sick and tired, wait, I'm pass sick and tired of this nonsense. It's like c'mon everybody, let's hang Suga for some stupid sh**. They have nothing else to do. 

Yes Jos`e it's like me, I just can't wait for 2025 for all of them to be out and healthy by God's grace. I'm happy that Hobi will be out in 2 months, at least there'll be another shoulder to lean on.

I can see Kookie crying in there about Suga. I know he must be feeling real bad about the situation and Jiminah too. That's ok, Suga will be just fine, because us ARMY'S WILL NEVER let him down. We'll ALWAYS have his back. We are ARMY'S, we leave no man behind.

It is you who manufactured this black mark against them, which I'm sure you will gleefully bring back up any time any of the members reveal themselves to be human. 
However, all you have achieved is that these past 3 weeks, Min Yoongi has been THE MOST LOVED PERSON IN THE WORLD. Not a single other person among 8 billion has been as loved and supported as he is. I don't even think Kamala Harris can claim this much love.
So, enjoy your puny little victory, or what I'm sure you perceive as a victory, while it lasts, because in the end, our love will be stronger and endure much longer than your hate.

(1) We all know the story of Yoongi's parents not being supportive of his music in the beginning, but even though ARMYs all over the world are loving him & supporting him & cheering him on, I HOPE that his PARENTS are doing the same, if not MORE. Does anybody think Yoongi's hearing the WORST of it from them?üòüTHAT would be heartbreaking.üò¢ (2) Part of Yoongi's mystique & allure is his ""cool cucumber""üòépersona, wrapped around a warm, caring heart.üíú He's our ""savage"" catüê±, with a heart of gold who always gives it to us straight & honest.üôÇ Does anybody think that whipping himself with shame & remorse, HIGHLY disproportionate to what he actually DID, has taken the ""FIGHT"" & love of music out of him?üòü (3) I was already prepared for the Boysüíúto be ""somewhat"" changed when they returned from the military & not so much like hyper puppies anymore, but . . . Does anybody think Yoongi/Suga/Agust D will be a SHELL of himself when he reunites with his brothers again?üòüThe line that REALLY scared me in one of Yoongi's apologies was when he wrote, '. . .I'll live a life of repentance.'  WHAT?!üò≥ Yoongi, NO!ü•∫ We're ALL flawed humans!üò® If THAT will be Min Yoongi's attitude moving forward, will he EVER be able to create music again?  Smile again?  Accept love from his brothers again?  I HOPE & PRAY that EVERY lyric in Yoongi's songs & the lyrics from Namjoon's, Jin's, J Hope's, Jimin's, Taehyung's & Jung Kook's songs that spoke of love & strength &  courage -- he NOW turns those lyrics on HIMSELF & ALLOW himself to HEAL & be LOVED for who he IS.üíú Remember Yoongi, what your brother Namjoon said in ""BUTTER""?üé∂ 'We've got ARMY right BEHIND us when we SAY so!'üíú BELIEVE us Yoongi!üíú  ARMY, I apologize for my long comment, but I just HAD to air these worries out or I was going to burst with frustration!üò≠ If anybody got this far, this Pennsylvania girl thanks you SO much for lending me your ""ears"".ü•¥ Ugh!

They ALL need to know....KARMA IS ARMY!!!  Army have been reaching out and supporting him the only way we can, streaming and posting our butts off to show THE WORLD how much we love and support him and BTS! Yesterday, BTS & Army (one and the same) made history AGAIN! Not only did we make an 8 year old song #1, (as well as many other of his songs charting) but the calculated support of Army bombarding social media with our support of Suga CHANGED THE ALGORITHIM! K-media & netizens who were trying their best to spread negativity about Yoongi with reports all over social media, and they were SHUT DOWN on 2 major platforms, Twitter & Naver! You could not find the posts/articles about his appearance, interviews, photos yesterday unless you specifically searched for them. (check out vid by Asian Entertainment and Culture https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5674X4KK0dI which basically called K-media irrelevant compared to Army support) I have never been more pissed by all the Bulllshi*t about this one small human mistake, or more ARMY PROUD by all the love and support that is literally drowning the negative narrative! I'll say it again in case you didn't hear or know......KARMA IS ARMY!!!

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out to you regarding the recent situation with Suga from BTS. I know you're already aware of the incident and his recent apology letter, but there's something weighing on my mind that I wanted to share with you. 

As a fellow fan, I couldn't help but notice that Suga's apology letter, while genuine, felt eerily similar to what someone might write if they were contemplating something much more serious. Even though there are no direct hints of suicide in the letter, the tone and the context, especially considering Suga's past openness about his struggles with depression, make me feel deeply concerned. It's heartbreaking to think that he might be in a really dark place right now, especially with how the media has blown this incident out of proportion. 

I'm worried that if this goes unnoticed, we might be facing a tragedy that could have been prevented. I strongly believe that Hybe, or whoever has the most direct access to Suga right now, needs to ensure that he has someone physically with him for support throughout this entire situation. This isn't something that should be taken lightly, and having someone there to make sure he's safe, both mentally and physically, could make all the difference. 

You have a large platform and a dedicated audience, many of whom are as concerned for Suga as I am. I was wondering if you could help spread the word and encourage others to reach out to Hybe or the appropriate authorities to ensure that Suga is getting the support he needs. It's not about assuming the worst, but rather about being proactive and making sure that our favorite artist is okay. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I know it's a heavy topic, but I truly believe that your voice could make a huge impact in ensuring Suga's safety. Please let me know what you think, and thank you for all the work you do for the BTS community.",1,2024-08-25T21:17:17Z,,2

I would not want him to wake up every morning feeling bad and hating himself because he disappointed others. We grow from our mistakes and that is a healthy response. Yoongi is a good man. He has a kind heart. He has so many wonderful qualities. I wish people would think how they would feel if that was their family member and had to watch helplessly as the media tries to garner more money by hurting someone in this way.

Yoongi does NOT have to apologize any more than he already has done so sincerely. The man is *obviously* being DRAGGED mercilessly for the twisted, opportunistic pleasures of shameless, evil hypocrites at the expense of SUGA/BTS. F*@!%$ them. 
Suga's in his 30's, scooting along on a kickboard scooter (something that he no doubt had little chance to do in his 20's), w/ a safety helmet on, drops his scooter in front of his own damn house otherwise without incident or harm. He was not and should not be asking to be excused for being intoxicated while on his kickboard scooter, and has taken above and beyond sincere responsibility for the lapse in judgment. SUGA DID NOT LIE. Yet K-media/antis (whatever those moronic trolls can be referred to) act as if he represents the level of *their* lost morality and integrity, and therefore can't make human mistakes. Goddamn, how ""perfect"" is he supposed to be to those money-grubbing asshats? I'm not the only one who LOVES Yoongi for his imperfections because he is the REALEST. He shows us how a life can be genuinely lead with honesty, that we are ok for being imperfect humans, but also how we have the ability to process and learn from our shortcomings, to grow from our life experiences moving forward, without disregard to the past. What K-media/haters are doing on Yoongi's expense, however, is astonishingly shitty, petty and opportunistic AF - they'd only cheer at a sniff of his demise (especially if they successfully cause it thru lies), treating him like he's the monster that he's not, if it lines their pocket$. 
What sensationalist K-media/haters do only exposes the worst in what SUGA/BTS (and other celebs) have been subjected to constantly. Although goodness will overcome, it is always attacked by hatred - that's what we can expect. And that's what justifies why we should be protective over Yoongi in this overtly harsh treatment of him. He's done so much for his country already and millions more outside of it. He deserves better treatment than this. 
I'm choosing to continue to celebrate Yoongi/SUGA/BTS, for all their flaws and perfections; for all their humanity and how they remind us of ours; for teaching millions how to love our better selves within us and dare to act accordingly. These haters/K-media that are trying to embarrass/take down SUGA for this ish, instead look foolish and pitiful to the rest of the world for their petty ass behavior over what would otherwise be considered a fairly minor infraction, all details considered. Yoongi is an honorable person who made a mistake. He should've been let off with a warning and a fine, imo. But this shit? Tsk. SMDH. Shame on K-media/haters for their own embarrassing actions... LIARS. May karma give you what you deserve.

Other peoples troubles and wrong doings seem to be what fuels media whether it be traditional news on TV or content makers on the various social platforms.  I am sure because of this, that this ‚Äúscandal‚Äù has persisted much longer than it would have if it wasnt a BTS member.  Anyone who knows Yoongi, anyone who has followed Yoongi, will know that he was sincere in his regret from his very first text over what had happened that night.  For Yoongi to feel that he needs to apologize more than once shows just how deep his remorse is, but it also shows the pressure he must be under from all that is being said through the media that he feels more than one apology is needed.  I hope and pray that Big Hit and Hybe are aware of this and will look out for Yoongi‚Äôs mental state.  As for ARMY, I suggest that we boycott the media outlets that are dragging this incident out.  We also should boycott any brands that disassociated themselves from Yoongi without first finding out the truth of the incident.  We should put our viewership and dollars toward those media outlets and brands that stood by him through this.  Let‚Äôs continue to send Yoongi our strength and love so that he knows that he has a real ARMY behind him!",3,2024-08-25T19:11:54Z,,0

I see ANY apology after the first one as a badge of honour that Yoongi is wearing. EVERY apology he has made or will make in the future is a badge of honour because it reflects the character of Yoongi. All the members have shown us who they are - caring, honest, humble and normal flawed human beings, this proven by how Yoongi is handling this situation. No different to any other person on the planet who makes mistakes in their lives and shows true character when they admit they made the mistake and apologise for it. If Yoongi wants to apologise again then that‚Äôs up to him and for me it will just solidify my admiration for how he has handled this situation. The haters could learn lessons from Yoongi in how you own up to your mistake and apologise when you ranted and raved on fake information, I don‚Äôt see any of the akgaes now apologising for their hate comments after the real footage disproved their argument. And no matter what haters do, BTS and ONLY BTS will decide on their future and their members. If you don‚Äôt support it or like it move along, there is no room for you as a fan and quite frankly the fandom needs a major clean out of the antis within.

If there's  one thing I hate, it is bullies. I had heard of BTS but didn't really know much about them. My sis and her kids are fans , so I showed her the article, and I commented on how mean the media photographers were. She said BTS has always been treated much worse
Since then, I have done major research  and have been disgusted at how badly BTS  has been treated.  their music has got me listening to music again not just their music but the ones I listened to when I was young. I love BTS, Suga is my fave however.  BTS has done nothing but brought positive attention to their culture,.and music. They have earned honors and awards galore but they are still treated badly. Why? Envy? Jealousy? These men are national treasures and should be treated as such
 They went through such hard times even after they debuted. They have all been through so much. Army has their back and always will. I may be a newbie but I know that Suga is a strong man, and as much as I hate what is being done to him, I know He will be ok. Ive been watching youtube videos, reading the 10th anniversary book. They make me laugh, but Ive cried a lot too. I will keep praying for him and BTS. I don't have a time machine handy, would I use it to go back so I could see them when they started? I sometimes wish I could, but I think that I ""discovered"" them when I needed them. I have been under  a lot of stress because of health issues and other things, watching their  funny videos  and listening to their music  has helped me a lot. And for that, I will stand by them. #EverythingIsGoingToBeAllright. SUGA, I PURPLE YOU üíúüíúüíúüíúüíú",26,2024-08-25T18:21:34Z,,2

The ways yoongi kept apologizing to the fans and the members is heartbreaking and the fact yoongi thinks he ruined BTS and ARMYs precious memories hurts so much. Reading that letter literally made my heart ache and made me cry bc I can tell Yoongi is really going through a hard time.

""Regarding your remorse towards the members, my first thought was that they admire you and we can see the love you all have for each other so I can‚Äôt imagine them feeling anything but anger and concern over how you‚Äôve been treated.  You started a show to support their solo endeavors for goodness‚Äô sake.  Who does that except for a stand-up person with amazing character and love for their brothers.""

I feel so bad for Suga and admit that I'm now really afraid for his mental health.

And, then everyone fakes surprise and sadness at their deaths when they are the ones who ""encourage"" it to happen. Just like what recently happened to the Parasite movie actor, who, after his passing, was found to not have committed the offense he was accused of.
