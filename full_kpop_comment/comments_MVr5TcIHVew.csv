Everyone worked hard and this music remains iconic. Even if there's a disturbing element, let's try to focus on the positive.
I will continue to love and listen to this song. While I understand the disgust and sadness of czennies, please continue to support NCT. I hope you'll be able to appreciate old music again.",10,2024-09-21T14:27:03Z

I loved his singing, especially his high note nearing the end. It's so beautiful. But now that man has seriously ruined everything for me. I genuinely can't listen to this song without feeling nauseous and want to throw up. I really hate him for this. I hope they can recreate this song without him.

Encima ver todos los comentarios positivos sobre él... después de tanta injusticia y dificultades que ha tenido que pasar para poder llegar donde esta... Ten,  lo estas consiguiendo, lo estas haciendo genial. 
Por otra parte, quiero decir que me alegro de haber empezado a stanear NCT desde rookies... haberlos conocido fue una de las mejores cosas que he hecho. Gracias a ellos mis días son mejores y mis oídos son bendecidos con sus temazos, yendo de lo más soft a lo más cañero <3",16,2021-12-14T18:16:41Z

The bridge was done beautifully!! It's such a heavenly feeling when he sings in low tones, he also sang similarly in superms song so long and I loved that. I would probably end up liking any song that he gets to sing in cause I love his voice damn too much!
Also SM please give him the solo album already! He's more than ready and us fans are eagerly waiting for it..",185,2021-12-14T16:50:19Z
