@하은-g8u2t,"관이는 딱 정석인 것 같음..깔끔하게 떨어지는데 이어지는 동작들이 다 부드러움. 한국 무용 같은 거 해줬으면 좋겠다..
가벼우면서도 툭툭 묵직하게 던지는 느낌이라 마냥 가볍다고 보기엔 사뭇 다른 것 같아서 보는 맛이 있었음
몸을 전체적으로 가볍게 쓰면서도 강약조절 확실한 편..근데 부드럽게, 바로바로 이어주는게 물 흐르듯 자연스러워서
딱딱 끊는 찬이랑은 또 다른 느낌.
찬이도 깔끔하게 떨어지는데 끊는 거 진짜 잘하는 것 같음(박자) 곡 이해도 높은 것 같음 분위기 잘 살림 ㄹㅇ,,
게다가 섬세한 디테일 하나 하나 빠짐 없이 다 챙김과 동시에 부드럽게 강약조절. 그래서 호시랑 있을때는 부드러운 면이 크게 보이는 것 같음. 약간 칼박+부드러운 선 이라 해야하나.. 동작 하나 하나에 부드럽고 깔끔 다 있음..",0,2024-10-05T14:09:27Z

@もちのり-q5x,"スングァンがマイクを置いたら…歌→ダンスに置き換えたら、こんな風になるのか！というのを思い知りました。新しい一面を見て泣いています。
一方で、ディノのカウントの取り方はとても正確で、ダイナミックかつ無駄のない所に誠実さすら感じました。真のダンサーなんだなと感じました。ディノにもっとコレオをして欲しいです！本当に素晴らしいダンスを見せてくれてありがとう🫶私も仕事頑張る気持ちになったし、ダンスもしたくなったし、何よりLIVEで会いたくなりました❤12月会えるので楽しみです😊",2,2023-10-09T18:44:16Z

@alora754,"While I'm literally amazed by how good of a performer boo is I'd still say if there's only one who can be in performance unit, dino is taking that position
Not saying seungkwan isn't an excellent performer but you gotta acc6that dino has fluidity that only some rare ace dancers would have. Each beat, each roll, each wave is clearly visible and that's something many of the performers miss too. Suengkwan is definitely an all-rounder to nearly match these levels but I'm gonna stick to the view that Dino got it better. Although it makes sense too since Dino is actually a member of performance unit. Although boo actually danced better than most of the vocals out there and actually better than even like half of the actual performers, so you gotta give the man credit for it

Although I really don't understand the sense of having units in svt. I've seen their performance units sing better than many vocals. I've seen their vocal unit dance better than many of the actual dancers. I've seen their hip hop line dance n sing like like they're the vocals and dancers. And let's not even talk about visuals. They're all all-rounders so why are there even specific units?",2,2023-09-13T12:36:42Z

It's not just focus on the upper & lower body movements or too focus on the extremities. His choreographies are very versatile~ it can either be powerful or soft, sensual or ascetic, smooth or controlled and many more. That's why kudos to uri Dino.",1,2023-07-24T15:41:42Z

@mai4717,"I often see main vocalist getting so shy and timid when asked to dance even tho they can do it if they are confident.

@azphine2681,"Dino exudes energy of being effortlessly captivating, look at how small but impactful his movements are. He also emphasizes the beat soo well, look at his left leg at 0:18. And Seungkwan did better than I expected, there were some moves where it felt like he couldn't keep up, but since he had big movements, he never slipped my mind. He was weirdly good, like, I never expected a main vocal to be able to dance so well next to a main dancer.

**When I talk about Seungkwan not being able to keep up, look at 0:18 again for example, Seungkwan has black clothes so it's hard to see, but he isn't able to make his leg move to the beat as Dino is able to. It also seems like he doesn't have much flexibility in some of his body parts, like, he seemed stiff in some areas compared to Dino, but then again it's comparing a main vocalist to a main dancer.",17,2022-08-01T05:49:35Z

@thatsookayb2425,"here after listening to chan's high five -- he's an amazing dancer, rapper, singer, choreographer, and now he's exploring writing and producing, there's no stopping him! so excited for the next danceology, I hope people realize its quality is equal to or greater than studio choom's artist of the month because he choreographs these performances himself !!!

I also love how this shows yet another side of boo, his variety sense is well-known and his vocals are amazing, plus I love seeing his athletic side on gose and even during racket boys (man that turned me into a boosadan HAAHAHA) but as one of the members said recently (I can't remember which one huhu), where can you find a main vocal who can dance this well?

This danceology is the best one so far (I say like I don't say the exact same thing for every danceology that comes out). Seungkwan was also amazing, it was kinda weird seeing him dance clear like this since I don't watch fancams and don't focus on every single member when I watch performances or dance practices, so I kind of forget who am I watching. So this was really refreshing to see him like this. Dino made another amazing choreo but what else is new.",102,2022-03-13T02:18:32Z

Seungkwan (the one in black) is one if seventeen’s main vocalist, but you could see how he could also pass off as one of the main dancers.

@ayuannur9557,"I can tell which one is Chan. Judging from the strong movements, amazing body control, and the one who looks so powerful. 
Our beloved Dino won't ever read this. This one is just one of comment among thousand comments for him. Dino started his career as my bias wrecker since SVT summer camp, when he slept in front of tent, wearing sunglasses and singing by himself under the sun. I don't know what he's thinking at that time but yeah he captivates me. It's not even by his dance did I notice him, but it's his voice first. When I looked back, oh, I already noticed Chan since then. Since Boom boom era.
Here's the part that could turn every Carats to him as their bias wrecks :

@evamariegapulan3510,"Seungkwan has always had potential to be a main dancer, I knew this from the first time I saw him freestyle (the iconic un haeng il chi freestyle). This man can MOVE I mean look at him perfectly matching the movements of one of kpop's best dancers ever. And ofc, how can I not talk abt dino on a danceology video like it blows my mind that someone can actually move this way like how is it even possible to dance like that?? And this choreo?? One of the best I have ever seen no exaggeration, dino just continues to prove himself as the actual future of kpop.

@RestFromTheStreets,"The choreo is AMAZING. So interesting to see Dino dancing next to Seungkwan ― one clear difference I spotted is that Seungkwan keeps his gaze forward, like a proper idol looking for the camera, while Dino uses his head and gaze to emphasize the choreo, even if that means not facing the camera. This is why I think Dino’s good enough to be a back-up dancer ― he knows how to dance just for the sake of dancing, not just for the sake of a performance.",111,2022-03-07T14:19:15Z

@Jessica-il5kl,"Dino of course is such an amazing yet underrated dancer. He deserves more credit and content for his choreography.

Seungkwan though was a really pleasant surprise to me. Of course all seventeen members are great dancers, but for seungkwan to pull this off somehow made me think if i had not appreciated his talent in dancing enough and REALLY seeing how good he is at performing 

More dino and seungkwan moments please ❤",173,2022-03-07T14:18:12Z

And Seungkwan too, by watching this vid only nobody could ever guess that his position is actually the main vocallist, I mean look at his so smooth moves.

@to.tuteng,Idk why but i wasn't able to see Seungkwan's name. Thought he was their backup dancer or smth. I was focused on Dino. But Seungkwan really grew so much became a great dancer compared to being not confident in his dancing skills 6 years ago and even contributes to choreographies. I really love him and all members as well! 💖,2,2022-03-07T11:42:26Z
