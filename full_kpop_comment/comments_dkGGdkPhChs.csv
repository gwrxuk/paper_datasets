Just my thoughts but since he's departure from the military he's been charming so many older Koreans with his tv appearances like Running Man & being the torch bearer at the Olympics I think he has a great chance appealing to local Koreans more not that he doesn't get World Wide attention cuz he does but frankly older Korean gp are a tough audience for BTS to crack because of the way they are treated in Kmedia & Korean TV. Because of them being lied about & minimized in the Korean media lots of Korean gp still don't get why BTS are popular, they still think of them as just another Kpop group not the huge artists they actually are. So I think Jin has a unique opportunity to charm Korean gp who previously have misunderstood BTS completely but again just my opinion, I will support whatever he wants to do with his music.",1,2024-10-16T21:18:24Z,UgwRhhO_5BcWQ44_Ihl4AaABAg,0
