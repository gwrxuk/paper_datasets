@윤슬-k8o,"팬이 아니라서 세븐틴 하면 아직도 부승관 말고는 몰랐는데
호시 때문에 요즘 세븐틴 영상 파는중이라.
세븐틴은 멤버들도 말했듯 춤 구멍이 1도 없는거같네
유난히 돋보이는 멤버나 묻히는 멤버가 있기 마련인데
세븐틴은 참 각각 멤버들이 매 앨범마다 잘 보이는듯.
매번 신인같은 패기 느껴지는것도 좋더라~",5,2023-02-27T17:31:17Z

@ghsqnf,wooooooah i know nothing about dancing but it doesn’t exactly feel like an easy feat for 13 people to dance in perfect synchronicity but svt manages to! love how every member keeps up such high energy and power throughout the song u can’t pinpoint a weak link at all! and having many members becomes a real advantage when it comes to formations—everything looks so much more fancy when everyone is moving rapidly across the stage going from occupying the whole scene to crowding together in 0.1s (a.k.a when seungkwan ended the first chorus) or the splitting up into smaller formations so cool kudos to svt and the choreographers!!!!,4,2023-02-08T21:47:08Z

@choose2bekindd,"“The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.”
‭‭2 Peter‬ ‭3:9‬ ‭NIV‬

ROMANS 10:9-11 “If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. As Scripture says, “Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame” 

Matthew 11:28-30  “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”

“For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.””
‭‭Luke‬ ‭19:10‬ ‭

God wants us to believe in His One and Only Son, Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior, who died for our sins :D When we truly believe in our hearts that Jesus is the Son of God, who died for our sins so we could have eternal life with God, we are saved from the eternal fire and have eternal life in Christ Jesus!! 💖 May God bless you all!! 🤗💞",0,2022-07-02T10:49:19Z

@eloisaodiadamusic,"I understand now why they included PIONEER (meaning the first to explore/innovative/first to apply a new method or activity) as a concept in their Face the Sun Album. They've already topped themselves over beyond compare. Hoshi even said, ""We know we're the best."" He's so unbothered and yet they still want to keep going farther than who they are now and to what more they could do.",29,2022-06-09T02:11:26Z

I like SVT but I wouldn't consider myself a Carat. I just pop in now and then when they have a comeback. That's why I didn't expect him to be so... wow. I just imagine him standing next to me hahaha. I'm a 21 year old female student from Poland and 175 cm tall (5.7 feet). So he really would be tiny next to me considering that he's ,,apparantly'' 164 cm (5.5) but I think that he's smaller since I saw them live and he's definatly not 164 cm but smaller hahaha. This song has benn stuck in my head since it came out tho. It's soooo good.",0,2022-06-08T12:18:18Z

어떻게 저렇게 춤추는데 노래까지 안정적으로 하는거죠?
진심 다들 폐를 한 3개쯤 보유하신 느낌인데;
난 가수의 본분은 노래라고 생각해서 무조건 가창력 따지는 사람입니다만
솔직히 인간적으로 세븐틴만은,
춤출 때 립싱크해도 쌉인정
댄스만으로도 이미 110점

@adimaibolewaqainabete2010,Wish Hybe would invest in better camera setup or expertise for their practice/choreography videos. It really improves the watching experience and can return meaningful dividends (eg. YG practice videos charting like MVs). Seventeen is such a complete group that you miss the impact of the quality of their presence with a static camera from 10 meters away. Love you Seventeen.

@hiroha_channel,セブチのどのダンスを見ても、何でそんなにみんな揃うの？ってぐらいピタッと揃っていて、見てて気持ちがいいのと、セブチ皆の中に同じカウンターがあるんじゃないかってぐらい、本当に凄いシンクロ率。ずっとダンスやっているからか、体幹もしっかりあって、誰一人とよろけたりもない。めっちゃ大変なはずなのに、みんな、簡単に楽しんでやってる感が凄い。,0,2022-06-01T04:18:08Z

@eyza8107,"Eisa capturing all the attention all on him and then suddenly spreading  it like a Domino throughout Seventeen made me realize once again why they are called “The Performance Powerhouse of Kpop.” Coming from RWY’s choreo where it feels like each second is a time to lose something, RWY keeps us out of breath, hanging by the edge of our seats, running together to reach something that could disappear quickly.  HOT, on the other hand, exudes such smoothness and self-assurance. The attention to detail to every beat makes the overall choreo radiate confidence which is complimented with the power of every movement. In conclusion, Seventeen are confident in their art & Hot & they’re very aware of that.",1,2022-05-31T15:27:31Z
