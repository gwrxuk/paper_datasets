To Jeonghan and Seventeen, I'll always wait for you. I will be a Carat till the last ""say the name"" and see you all complete again. 

3:04 ""But still, don't cry. Though it will be sad, I will faintly stay here for you."" The lyrics comforts me alot.Thank you Seventeen.🥺💖",6,2024-06-08T05:28:41Z

@cheolchwe5763,"It's been 4 yrs since I first heard this song and it's still my most favorite. It's in a way so comforting that no other song can be to me. It's an absolute gem of a song, the lyrics, the vocals is so unbeatable. Atp even if I don't speak their language, I guess I've got the lyrics memorised by heart by just listening to it so many times. Pinwheel will always have a special place in my heart.

@shadeofpink-is1bi,"[English Translation]

I waited for you
From far away
Cold wind keeps blowing
A very small pinwheel
Just blanking standing there
Looking so lonely as if it’s looking for someone
Felt like I was looking at me

Many things happen
So busy without a breath to catch
Because of this damn world
If I say that’s why we grew apart
Feels like I’m making it up so I have no faults
So I can’t say that
I’m just facing the wind

In the future
So I won’t be sorry
I want to always be waiting
That makes me feel better
Even if you get lost
And it takes you a while
Come round and round back to me
Even if it’s far ahead in the future

People only see the outside
And ask if the wind is cold
They just ask and pass by
Why ask if you’re gonna forget anyway?
Feels like wind from you
So without a word, I’m just waiting

Many things happen
So busy without a breath to catch
Because of this damn world
If I say that’s why we grew apart
Feels like I’m making it up so I have no faults
So I can’t say that
I’m just facing the wind

In the future
So I won’t be sorry
I want to always be waiting
That makes me feel better
Even if you get lost
And it takes you a while
Come round and round back to me
Even if it’s far ahead in the future

Feels like time has hidden
And taken you too
Can’t I see you?
Sometimes, I get bad thoughts
I start to forget you

But don’t cry
It may seem sad
But I’m here
For you

Even if you get lost
And it takes you a while
Come round and round back to me
Even if it’s far ahead in the future

@Qrayyyyyyyyy,"너를 기다리다 바라봤어
저기 저기 멀리 어느 샌가
찬 바람이 계속 부는 거 같아
아주 작은 바람개비
혼자 서서 그저 멍하니
누군갈 쓸쓸히 애타게
찾는 게 꼭 나 같아
이런저런 일들 숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐 같은 세상 땜에 너와 내가 멀어진 거라 둘러대면
Um 괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아 그러진 못하고
바람만 맞으며 서있어
먼 훗날 너에게
미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래 그래 그게 더 맘 편해
오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도
사람들은 다를 겉으로만
바람이 차지않냐 물어봐
그냥 그렇게 묻곤 지나가서
다 잊어버릴 거면서 왜 물어봐
너에게서 부는 바람 같아서
그저 아무 말없이 기다릴 뿐인데
이런저런 일들 숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐 같은 세상 땜에 너와 내가 멀어진 거라 둘러대면
괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아 그러진 못하고
바람만 맞으며 서있어
먼 훗날 너에게 미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래 그래 그게 더 맘 편해
오는 길을 잃어 오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도
이 시간은 저 편에 숨어버린 것만 같아 널 데리고
Um huh 이대로 널 볼 수 없을까
가끔은 안 좋은 생각도 들어 난
네 모습이 잊혀져만 가
그래도 울지마
슬플 거 같지만
희미하게 남아
있는 너를 위해
오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면 돼

@camillebaluyot,"This is actually the first Seventeen song I fell in love with. I didn’t know them before but this has been in my playlist & liked song for a long time already (thankful to TWICE Jeongyeon for recommending this song). I know it’s from SVT but tbh, I never had an interest in knowing them because I’m a Kpop GG enthusiast. 2 months ago I came across with game caterers hybe special because of le sserafim. After watching it, I immediately looked for more SVT contents because they stole my heart in that show!! Hoshi & Seungkwan caught my attention (I still want to baby them until now!!) but after knowing all the SVT members, watching their MVs, GoSe, etc., I became a Jeonghan stan. 😂😂 and to my surprise, Pinwheel is a sub-unit song from the vocal unit! All this time I thought all the members sang it. There are a lot of things to explore about SVT, and I’m really happy bcos I made the right choice— Seventeen as my first ever kpop boy group to LOVE. ❤",10,2023-07-21T15:01:25Z

@aindhilla2426,"너를 기다리다 바라봤어
저기 저기 멀리 어느 샌가
찬 바람이 계속 부는 거 같아
아주 작은 바람개비
혼자 서서 그저 멍하니
누군갈 쓸쓸히 애타게
찾는 게 꼭 나 같아
이런저런 일들 숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐 같은 세상 땜에 너와 내가 멀어진 거라 둘러대면
Um 괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아 그러진 못하고
바람만 맞으며 서있어
먼 훗날 너에게
미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래 그래 그게 더 맘 편해
오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도
사람들은 다를 겉으로만
바람이 차지않냐 물어봐
그냥 그렇게 묻곤 지나가서
다 잊어버릴 거면서 왜 물어봐
너에게서 부는 바람 같아서
그저 아무 말없이 기다릴 뿐인데
이런저런 일들 숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐 같은 세상 땜에 너와 내가 멀어진 거라 둘러대면
괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아 그러진 못하고
바람만 맞으며 서있어
먼 훗날 너에게 미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래 그래 그게 더 맘 편해
오는 길을 잃어 오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도
이 시간은 저 편에 숨어버린 것만 같아 널 데리고
Um huh 이대로 널 볼 수 없을까
가끔은 안 좋은 생각도 들어 난
네 모습이 잊혀져만 가
그래도 울지마
슬플 거 같지만
희미하게 남아
있는 너를 위해
오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도

During those lonely nights where I would breakdown and cry, I would always play this song after I've calmed down from my negative thoughts and feelings. Pinwheel in those moments felt like a hug, a reassurance that everything is going to be alright and they were right. After listening to this song, I would fall asleep with all my worries washed away then the next thing I knew, I was more than ready to face another day with my head held high.

@bella5012,its still a comforting and a soothing song that tells a person to hold on with their head heald high even with the critisisms that a person faces even with the closest person to him/her/they/them. it gives me the courage to go even the hardest of days in the front of me. this is really one of the best music of vocal unit of seventeen that you will come back to even after all this years and this is what all seventeen is songs you can come back too even when so many years has passed.hats off to seventeen and the vocal team to bring this song,129,2022-12-09T04:23:48Z

@ataya1,"너를 기다리다 바라봤어
저기 저기 멀리 어느 샌가
찬 바람이 계속 부는 거 같아

아주 작은 바람개비
혼자 서서 그저 멍하니
누군갈 쓸쓸히 애타게
찾는 게 꼭 나 같아

이런저런 일들 숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐 같은 세상 땜에 너와 내가 멀어진 거라 둘러대면
Um 괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아 그러진 못하고
바람만 맞으며 서있어

먼 훗날 너에게
미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래 그래 그게 더 맘 편해
오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도

사람들은 다를 겉으로만
바람이 차지않냐 물어봐
그냥 그렇게 묻곤 지나가서
다 잊어버릴 거면서 왜 물어봐
너에게서 부는 바람 같아서
그저 아무 말없이 기다릴 뿐인데

이런저런 일들 숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐 같은 세상 땜에 너와 내가 멀어진 거라 둘러대면

괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아 그러진 못하고
바람만 맞으며 서있어

먼 훗날 너에게 미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래 그래 그게 더 맘 편해
오는 길을 잃어 오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도

이 시간은 저 편에 숨어버린 것만 같아 널 데리고
Um huh 이대로 널 볼 수 없을까
가끔은 안 좋은 생각도 들어 난
네 모습이 잊혀져만 가

그래도 울지마
슬플 거 같지만
희미하게 남아
있는 너를 위해

오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도",0,2022-11-14T09:31:29Z

This song, these boys, this fandom reminded me that I have a dream and I have a life to live on. I found my comfort, my home. It's really true that you can find Seventeen when you needed them the most. Together, to the future, even though it will take a long time, I'll patiently wait and grow with you.

@angelam.remoriata200,"Lyrics:

I've been waiting for you
너를 기다리다 바라봤어

Where are you going over there?
저기 저기 멀리 어느 샌가

It feels like the cold wind keeps blowing
찬 바람이 계속 부는 거 같아

very small pinwheel
아주 작은 바람개비

Standing alone and just blankly
혼자 서서 그저 멍하니

For someone else, lonely and longing
누군갈 쓸쓸히 애타게

I'm just looking for
찾는 게 꼭 나 같아

busy with various things
이런저런 일들 숨가쁘게 바쁜

Because of this kind of world, you and I are far apart.
이 뭐 같은 세상 땜에 너와 내가 멀어진 거라 둘러대면

Um, as if I'm not at fault
Um 괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼

It seems like I'm making up, I can't
꾸며내는 것만 같아 그러진 못하고

I'm standing in the wind
바람만 맞으며 서있어

to you in the future
먼 훗날 너에게

not sorry
미안하지 않게

I'll always wait, yeah that's more comfortable
늘 난 기다릴래 그래 그게 더 맘 편해

get lost
오는 길을 잃어

even if it takes a long time
오래 걸린대도

Turn around and come back to me
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면 돼

even in the distant future
먼 훗날이라도

people look different
사람들은 다를 겉으로만

Ask if it's not windy
바람이 차지않냐 물어봐

I just asked and passed
그냥 그렇게 묻곤 지나가서

Why do you ask, saying you'll forget everything
다 잊어버릴 거면서 왜 물어봐

like the wind blowing from you
너에게서 부는 바람 같아서

I'm just waiting without a word
그저 아무 말없이 기다릴 뿐인데

busy with various things
이런저런 일들 숨가쁘게 바쁜

Because of this kind of world, you and I are far apart.
이 뭐 같은 세상 땜에 너와 내가 멀어진 거라 둘러대면

As if I'm not wrong
괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼

It seems like I'm making up, I can't
꾸며내는 것만 같아 그러진 못하고

I'm standing in the wind
바람만 맞으며 서있어

So that I won't feel sorry for you in the future
먼 훗날 너에게 미안하지 않게

I'll always wait, yeah that's more comfortable
늘 난 기다릴래 그래 그게 더 맘 편해

Even if I lost my way and it took a long time
오는 길을 잃어 오래 걸린대도

Turn around and come back to me
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면 돼

even in the distant future
먼 훗날이라도

This time seems to be hiding on the other side, taking you
이 시간은 저 편에 숨어버린 것만 같아 널 데리고

Um huh can't I see you like this
Um huh 이대로 널 볼 수 없을까

Sometimes I have bad thoughts
가끔은 안 좋은 생각도 들어 난

I'm just forgetting you
네 모습이 잊혀져만 가

don't cry though
그래도 울지마

I think it's sad
슬플 거 같지만

remain dim
희미하게 남아

for you who are
있는 너를 위해

get lost
오는 길을 잃어

even if it takes a long time
오래 걸린대도

Turn around and come back to me
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면 돼

even in the distant future
먼 훗날이라도

저기 저기 멀리 어느 샌가
찬 바람이 계속 부는 거 같아
아주 작은 바람개비
혼자 서서 그저 멍하니
누군갈 쓸쓸히 애타게
찾는 게 꼭 나 같아
이런저런 일들 숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐 같은 세상 땜에 너와 내가 멀어진 거라 둘러대면
Um 괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아 그러진 못하고
바람만 맞으며 서있어
먼 훗날 너에게
미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래 그래 그게 더 맘 편해
오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도
사람들은 다를 겉으로만
바람이 차지않냐 물어봐
그냥 그렇게 묻곤 지나가서
다 잊어버릴 거면서 왜 물어봐
너에게서 부는 바람 같아서
그저 아무 말없이 기다릴 뿐인데
이런저런 일들 숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐 같은 세상 땜에 너와 내가 멀어진 거라 둘러대면
괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아 그러진 못하고
바람만 맞으며 서있어
먼 훗날 너에게 미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래 그래 그게 더 맘 편해
오는 길을 잃어 오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도
이 시간은 저 편에 숨어버린 것만 같아 널 데리고
Um huh 이대로 널 볼 수 없을까
가끔은 안 좋은 생각도 들어 난
네 모습이 잊혀져만 가
그래도 울지마
슬플 거 같지만
희미하게 남아
있는 너를 위해
오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면 돼

@SliverOfSilverStars,"I'm a really anxious person. Especially lately. My body is almost always tense somewhere and I find it difficult to relax that tension. I'm working on finding a therapist. But this song is incredible. When I first discovered seventeen, I would listen to this song almost every night while trying to sleep. I haven't done that for a while now but tonight I was feeling really anxious and decided to watch the Pinwheel MV. It's incredible, the moment I hear the beginning piano notes, I can feel so much tension release from my body and a sense of calm washes over me. I just love this song so much and am really grateful that woozi once had a dream about a small pinwheel on a hill and turned it into a song.",4,2022-04-09T11:15:24Z

@nicuzoia,"This song feels so nostalgic; it reminds me of my baby carat self looking up some SEVENTEEN songs I should listen to while memorizing their names and units where they belong. You see, I became a Carat almost a year after this song's release, and this song is one of the greatest reasons why I chose to be one. I am so happy to the point that I feel like crying while looking back to those days (╥﹏╥) 

And even after almost 5 years after release, and 4 years of being a carat, Pinwheel, still, has a very special place in my heart.",24,2022-01-22T20:52:00Z

@pbtjasmine4217,"너를 기다리다 바라봤어
저기 저기 멀리 어느 샌가
찬 바람이 계속 부는 거 같아
아주 작은 바람개비
혼자 서서 그저 멍하니
누군갈 쓸쓸히 애타게
찾는 게 꼭 나 같아
이런저런 일들 숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐 같은 세상 땜에 너와 내가 멀어진 거라 둘러대면
Um 괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아 그러진 못하고
바람만 맞으며 서있어
먼 훗날 너에게
미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래 그래 그게 더 맘 편해
오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도
사람들은 다를 겉으로만
바람이 차지않냐 물어봐
그냥 그렇게 묻곤 지나가서
다 잊어버릴 거면서 왜 물어봐
너에게서 부는 바람 같아서
그저 아무 말없이 기다릴 뿐인데
이런저런 일들 숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐 같은 세상 땜에 너와 내가 멀어진 거라 둘러대면
괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아 그러진 못하고
바람만 맞으며 서있어
먼 훗날 너에게 미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래 그래 그게 더 맘 편해
오는 길을 잃어 오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도
이 시간은 저 편에 숨어버린 것만 같아 널 데리고
Um huh 이대로 널 볼 수 없을까
가끔은 안 좋은 생각도 들어 난
네 모습이 잊혀져만 가
그래도 울지마
슬플 거 같지만
희미하게 남아
있는 너를 위해
오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도",1,2021-11-03T04:09:16Z

@anotherofme5832,"I waited for you
From far away
Cold wind keeps blowing
A very small pinwheel
Just blanking standing there
Looking so lonely as if it’s looking for someone
Felt like I was looking at me

Many things happen
So busy without a breath to catch
Because of this damn world
If I say that’s why we grew apart
Feels like I’m making it up so I have no faults
So I can’t say that
I’m just facing the wind

In the future
So I won’t be sorry
I want to always be waiting
That makes me feel better
Even if you get lost
And it takes you a while
Come round and round back to me
Even if it’s far ahead in the future

People only see the outside
And ask if the wind is cold
They just ask and pass by
Why ask if you’re gonna forget anyway?
Feels like wind from you
So without a word, I’m just waiting

Many things happen
So busy without a breath to catch
Because of this damn world
If I say that’s why we grew apart
Feels like I’m making it up so I have no faults
So I can’t say that
I’m just facing the wind

In the future
So I won’t be sorry
I want to always be waiting
That makes me feel better
Even if you get lost
And it takes you a while
Come round and round back to me
Even if it’s far ahead in the future

Feels like time has hidden
And taken you too
Can’t I see you?
Sometimes, I get bad thoughts
I start to forget you

But don’t cry
It may seem sad
But I’m here
For you

Even if you get lost
And it takes you a while
Come round and round back to me
Even if it’s far ahead in the future",0,2021-10-29T08:15:40Z

@georgie740,"I'm getting goosebumps on an unhealthy next level after actually understanding the lyrics and tbh,I just found out that pinwheel symbolises childhood innocence, so they're actually referring to their lost self and it sooooooo fuckn makes sense to the point of tears 😢😭❤

Also Woozi being a fellow INFJ,..Omo I can totally relate to him writing songs like that. I've always been able to connect to music on a heavenly level..and I always wanted to be a musician but I just know that people won't let me....it hurts that I can't seem to express my emotions like him on paper and notes 🎼 🥺..but at least I'm more than happy to find SEVENTEEN and the way I always can relate to them is just breaking my heart into pieces like how the in hell sth can be relatable sooooooooooooo freakn much 🥺🖤🖤🤍🤍💖💖",1,2021-08-17T15:21:36Z

I didn't like this song before but when i discover the meaning of song i began to like this song until it became my fav song of seventeen. Whenever i feel sad, remembering my Dad i'll always search this song. This song was about longing for someone you can't be with anymore.. Whenever i listen to this i feel like I'm telling to my dad some words or phrases that i didn't tell him when he was here.

So to those Carat's/ people like me who lose of their loved ones, go to this song and you will be comforted.",7,2021-07-03T18:41:47Z

@moyadana2694,"너를 기다리다 바라봤어
저기 저기 멀리 어느 샌가
찬바람이 계속 부는 거 같아

아주 작은 바람개비
혼자 서서 그저 멍하니
누군갈 쓸쓸히 애타게
찾는 게 꼭 나 같아

이런저런 일들
숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐 같은 세상 땜에
너와 내가 멀어진 거라 둘러대면

괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아
그러진 못하고
바람만 맞으며 서있어

먼 훗날 너에게
미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래
그래 그게 더 맘 편해

오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게
다시 찾아와주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도

사람들은 다들 겉으로만
바람이 차지 않냐 물어봐
그냥 그렇게 묻곤 지나가서
다 잊어버릴 거면서 왜 물어봐

너에게서
부는 바람 같아서
그저 아무 말없이
기다릴 뿐인데

이런저런 일들
숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐 같은 세상 땜에
너와 내가 멀어진 거라 둘러대면

괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아
그러진 못하고
바람만 맞으며 서있어

먼 훗날 너에게
미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래
그래 그게 더 맘 편해

오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게
다시 찾아와주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도

이 시간은
저 편에 숨어버린 것만 같아
널 데리고

이대로 널 볼 수 없을까
가끔은 안 좋은 생각도 들어 난
네 모습이 잊혀져만 가

그래도 울지마
슬플 거 같지만
희미하게 남아
있는 너를 위해

오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게
다시 찾아와주면 돼

먼 훗날이라도

@fayethalia9258,"Pinwheel English Lyrics

I waited for you
From far away
Cold wind keeps blowing
A very small pinwheel
Just blanking standing there
Looking so lonely as if it’s looking for someone
Felt like I was looking at me
 
Many things happen
So busy without a breath to catch
Because of this damn world
If I say that’s why we grew apart
Feels like I’m making it up so I have no faults
So I can’t say that
I’m just facing the wind
 
In the future
So I won’t be sorry
I want to always be waiting, that makes me feel better
Even if you get lost
And it takes you a while
Come round and round back to me
Even if it’s far ahead in the future
 
People only see the outside
And ask if the wind is cold
They just ask and pass by
Why ask if you’re gonna forget anyway?
Feels like wind from you
So without a word, I’m just waiting
 
Many things happen
So busy without a breath to catch
Because of this damn world
If I say that’s why we grew apart
Feels like I’m making it up so I have no faults
So I can’t say that
I’m just facing the wind
 
In the future
So I won’t be sorry
I want to always be waiting, that makes me feel better
Even if you get lost
And it takes you a while
Come round and round back to me
Even if it’s far ahead in the future
 
Feels like time has hidden
And taken you too
Can’t I see you?
Sometimes, I get bad thoughts
I start to forget you
 
But don’t cry
It may seem sad
But I’m here
For you
 
Even if you get lost
And it takes you a while
Come round and round back to me
Even if it’s far ahead in the future

@danielleflores5514,"I waited for you
From far away
Cold wind keeps blowing
A very small pinwheel
Just blanking standing there
Looking so lonely as if it’s looking for someone
Felt like I was looking at me
 
Many things happen
So busy without a breath to catch
Because of this damn world
If I say that’s why we grew apart
Feels like I’m making it up so I have no faults
So I can’t say that
I’m just facing the wind
 
In the future
So I won’t be sorry
I want to always be waiting, that makes me feel better
Even if you get lost
And it takes you a while
Come round and round back to me
Even if it’s far ahead in the future
 
People only see the outside
And ask if the wind is cold
They just ask and pass by
Why ask if you’re gonna forget anyway?
Feels like wind from you
So without a word, I’m just waiting
 
Many things happen
So busy without a breath to catch
Because of this damn world
If I say that’s why we grew apart
Feels like I’m making it up so I have no faults
So I can’t say that
I’m just facing the wind
 
In the future
So I won’t be sorry
I want to always be waiting, that makes me feel better
Even if you get lost
And it takes you a while
Come round and round back to me
Even if it’s far ahead in the future
 
Feels like time has hidden
And taken you too
Can’t I see you?
Sometimes, I get bad thoughts
I start to forget you
 
But don’t cry
It may seem sad
But I’m here
For you
 
Even if you get lost
And it takes you a while
Come round and round back to me
Even if it’s far ahead in the future

저기 저기 멀리 어느샌가
찬 바람이 계속 부는 것 같아
아주 작은 바람개비
혼자서 그저 멍하니
누군가를 쓸쓸히 애타게
찾는 게 꼭 나 같아

이런저런 일들
숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐같은 세상 땜에 너와 내가 멀어진
거라 둘러대면
괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아 그러지 못하고
바람만 맞으며 서있어

먼 훗날 너에게
미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래 그래 그게 더 맘 편해
오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와 주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도

사람들은 다를 겉으로만
바람이 차지 않냐 물어봐
그냥 그렇게 묻고 지나갔어
다 잊어버릴 거면서 왜 물어봐
너에게서 부른 바람 같아서
그저 아무 말 없이 기다릴 뿐인데

이런저런 일들
숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐같은 세상 땜에 너와 내가 멀어진
거라 둘러대면
괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아 그러지 못하고
바람만 맞으며 서있어

먼 훗날 너에게
미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래 그래 그게 더 맘 편해
오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와 주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도

이 시간은 저 편에 숨어버린 것만 같아
널 데리러
이대로 널 볼 수 없을까
가끔은 안 좋은 생각도 들러 난
니 모습이 잊혀져만 가

그래도 울지마
슬플 것 같지만
희미하게 남아
웃는 너를 위해

오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와 주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도",1,2021-03-08T11:49:31Z

저기 저기 멀리 어느 샌가
찬바람이 계속 부는 거 같아
아주 작은 바람개비
혼자 서서 그저 멍하니
누군갈 쓸쓸히 애타게
찾는 게 꼭 나 같아
이런저런 일들
숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐 같은 세상 땜에
너와 내가 멀어진 거라 둘러대면
괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아
그러진 못하고
바람만 맞으며 서있어
먼 훗날 너에게
미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래
그래 그게 더 맘 편해
오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게
다시 찾아와주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도
사람들은 다들 겉으로만
바람이 차지않냐 물어봐
그냥 그렇게 묻곤 지나가서
다 잊어버릴 거면서 왜 물어봐
너에게서
부는 바람 같아서
그저 아무 말없이
기다릴 뿐인데
이런저런 일들
숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐 같은 세상 땜에
너와 내가 멀어진 거라 둘러대면
괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아
그러진 못하고
바람만 맞으며 서있어
먼 훗날 너에게
미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래
그래 그게 더 맘 편해
오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게
다시 찾아와주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도
이 시간은 저 편에 숨어버린 것만 같아
널 데리고
이대로 널 볼 수 없을까
가끔은 안 좋은 생각도 들어 난
네 모습이 잊혀져만 가
그래도 울지마
슬플 거 같지만
희미하게 남아
있는 너를 위해
오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게

When i first listened to this song, i felt some kind of feeling i havent experienced feeling yet. The lyrics are so beautiful and the instrumental is just as beautiful as the lyrics (my favorite parts of the instrumental were the piano parts lol). I might get hated because of this but I think Pinwheel is better than DWC but they're still all beautiful on their own ways",9,2021-01-22T18:10:07Z

@Seokminl,"At this point i only trust seventeen about everything. About my feelings, Emotions, Pain, Hardships, Happiness they became my breath when i don't have anyone. I reached the point that i don't need anyone. Just them. Only them. Others find comfort with someone. But me i find my comfort zone with them. Funny how many people left me behind but Seventeen never did that to me. Being introvert person and unexpressive one is really hard it feels like you hold your emotions and you don't have the rights to show them what you really feels because you're scared hear painful word. I don't need someone who comforts me with 'It's okay everything will be fine just think other people having hard problem than yours' istg that's not helpful you're just adding salt to wounds. Sometimes quiet ones need to understand too. Not everything you see is the truth. Behind those smiles there's millions or even billion tears pouring down every single night.",2,2020-12-07T17:16:56Z

@alyssawinesti2289,"너를 기다리다 바라봤어
저기 저기 멀리 어느샌가
찬바람이 계속 부는 거 같아
아주 작은 바람개비
혼자 서서 그저 멍하니
누군가 쓸쓸히 애타게 찾는 게
꼭 나같아
이런저런 일들 숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐 같은 세상 때문에
너와 내가 멀어진 거라 둘러대면
괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아
그러지 못하고 바람만 맞으며 서있어
먼훗날 너에게 미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래 그래 그게 더 맘편해
오는 길을 잃어 오래 걸린데도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면돼
먼훗날이라도
사람들은 다들 겉으로만
바람이 차지 않냐 물어봐
그냥 그렇게 묻곤 지나가서
다 잊어버릴 거면서 왜 물어봐
너에게서 부는 바람 같아서
그저 아무 말없이 기다릴 뿐인데
이런저런 일들 숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐 같은 세상 때문에
너와 내가 멀어진 거라 둘러대면
괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아
그러지 못하고 바람만 맞으며 서있어
먼훗날 너에게 미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래 그래 그게 더 맘편해
오는 길을 잃어 오래 걸린데도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면돼
먼훗날이라도
이 시간은 저편에 숨어버린 것만 같아 널 데리고
이대로 널 볼 수 없을까
가끔은 안 좋은 생각도 들어 난
니 모습이 잊혀져만 가
그래도 울지마
슬플 거 같지만
희미하게 남아
웃는 너를 위해
오는 길을 잃어 오래 걸린데도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면돼
먼훗날이라도",0,2020-11-27T02:29:21Z

Also let’s stream Home;Run and semicolon. We said we would get 50 million in just a week, but we haven’t even gotten it to 40 million and it’s been a month. I want the members to see the love and support we have for them, even more than we are showing them. And if possible even stream all the other music videos. We haven’t gotten “very nice” “manse” “adore u” “clap” “fear” “hit” “oh my” or “left and right” at 100 million yet and we said we would. There is so much more mv that I know we can get on top. And let’s even get dwc to 200 million. I know we can do it because I see the huge amount of love the boys get each and every day. Seventeen are the 2nd biggest bg rn, so let’s show everyone else the amazing music and content Seventeen give us.  

Ps. This wasn’t meant to offend anyone in any way. I love so many groups, but I see that Seventeen don’t get the recognized they deserve. And yes I know they got an award recognized by the president of sk, so let’s show everyone why they got the award for changing the culture and arts.",5,2020-11-24T21:36:56Z

@윌리웡카-u4b,"안녕하세요. 볼 수 있을 지는 모르겠지만 댓글 남겨 봅니다. 
세븐틴 노래중 [바람개비]라는 노래는 정말 저에게 힘이 되준 노래라서요.. 
이 노래가 나왔을 당시 저는 고등학생이었고, 
가정불화때문에 상담을 다닐 정도로 정신적으로 많이 지쳐있는 상태였어요.
그 불화는 아직도 나아지지 않아서 어제도 출가를 하네마네 아빠를 이해하라는 둥 심각하게 싸웠습니다.
싸웠다고 하기도 묘하네요... 일방적으로 제가 모욕을 들었습니다. 
이런 가정이 저 하나만 있을 거라고 생각하진 않아요.
아무튼 그렇게 힘들때마다 이 노래가 많은 힘이 되었어요. 
3년전부터 꾸준히 우울할때마다 이 노래를 듣고 울었습니다.
처음 나왔을때부터 듣고 울었어요... 저한테 해주는 말 같아서.
'그냥 그렇게 묻곤 지나가서 다 잊어버릴 거면서 왜 물어봐'
이 가사를 듣고 정말 펑펑 울었습니다. 제 상황 같아서...
좋은 노래를 만들어주셔서 정말 감사합니다. 앞으로도 세븐틴의 활보를 응원해요. 화이팅!",1,2020-11-18T02:45:49Z

@rochellegaytano8412,"너를 기다리다 바라봤어
저기 저기 멀리 어느 샌가
찬 바람이 계속 부는 거 같아

아주 작은 바람개비
혼자 서서 그저 멍하니
누군갈 쓸쓸히 애타게
찾는 게 꼭 나 같아

이런저런 일들
숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐 같은 세상 땜에 너와 내가 멀어진
거라 둘러대면
괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아 그러진 못하고
바람만 맞으며 서있어

먼 훗날 너에게
미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래 그래
그게 더 맘 편해
오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도

사람들은 다를 겉으로만
바람이 차지않냐 물어봐
그냥 그렇게 묻곤 지나가서
다 잊어버릴 거면서 왜 물어봐
너에게서 부는 바람 같아서
그저 아무 말없이 기다릴 뿐인데

이런저런 일들
숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐 같은 세상 땜에 너와 내가 멀어진
거라 둘러대면
괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아 그러진 못하고
바람만 맞으며 서있어

먼 훗날 너에게
미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래 그래
그게 더 맘 편해
오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도

이 시간은 저 편에 숨어버린 것만 같아
널 데리고
이대로 널 볼 수 없을까
가끔은 안 좋은 생각도 들어 난
네 모습이 잊혀져만 가

그래도 울지마
슬플 거 같지만
희미하게 남아
있는 너를 위해

오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도",1,2020-10-31T09:07:35Z

@nooraziela3645,"너를 기다리다 바라봤어
저기 저기 멀리 어느샌가
찬바람이 계속 부는 거 같아

아주 작은 바람개비
혼자 서서 그저 멍하니
누군가 쓸쓸히 애타게 찾는 게
꼭 나같아

이런저런 일들 숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐 같은 세상 때문에
너와 내가 멀어진 거라 둘러대면
괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아
그러지 못하고 바람만 맞으며 서있어

먼훗날 너에게 미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래 그래 그게 더 맘편해

오는 길을 잃어 오래 걸린데도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면돼
먼훗날이라도

사람들은 다들 겉으로만
바람이 차지 않냐 물어봐
그냥 그렇게 묻곤 지나가서
다 잊어버릴 거면서 왜 물어봐

너에게서 부는 바람 같아서
그저 아무 말없이 기다릴 뿐인데

이런저런 일들 숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐 같은 세상 때문에
너와 내가 멀어진 거라 둘러대면
괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아
그러지 못하고 바람만 맞으며 서있어

먼훗날 너에게 미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래 그래 그게 더 맘편해

오는 길을 잃어 오래 걸린데도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면돼
먼훗날이라도

이 시간은 저편에 숨어버린 것만 같아 널 데리고
이대로 널 볼 수 없을까
가끔은 안 좋은 생각도 들어 난
니 모습이 잊혀져만 가

그래도 울지마
슬플 거 같지만
희미하게 남아
웃는 너를 위해

오는 길을 잃어 오래 걸린데도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면돼
먼훗날이라도",1,2020-10-21T13:59:36Z

@user-gl8ck6ps6h,"سمعتها....
كنت امشي في الحديقة وحيدة فجاة وقعت..... بكيت بشدة لاني تألمت. 💔
حاولت الصراخ لكنني تأكدت انه ما من جدوى من كل هذا....  لقد كنت وحيدة بحق في ذلك الوقت. 💔 حاولت بصعوبة النهوض من على الأرض و رأيت الدماء تنزف من قدمي لم أصدق انه بسبب خطأ صغير في المشي وقعت. 💔
لقد صدمت حقا إلى أن وصلت للبيت. اخيرا لكن لم يكترث احد لي لقد اعتقدوا انه مجرد جرح بسيط. 💔💔💔
لقد وددت الذهاب للمستشفى في تلك الليلة لكن بعد محاولات مع اهلي لم أستطع. 💔
لقد كنت اتألم طول تلك الليلة و حاولت تعقيم جرحي وحدي. 💔
لقد منعت من الخروج بحجة انني أقع كثيرا بحجة انني لا أعرف المشي. 💔
مشكلتي الوحيدة انني لم أجد أحدا يدعمني. 💔💔💔
في كل ليلة كنت اتأمل في القمر 😞
كنت أحاول بشدة ان افهم لم يحدث لي هذا؟؟؟
لم الجميع يكرهني؟؟؟؟
لم لا يود الجميع ان يساعدني؟؟؟؟
هل اعيش في حلم تافه و تعيس!!
لم لا اموت؟؟؟
بعد لحظات سمعت أحدا يصرخ في غرفتي......
- إستيقظي إنها بداية يوم جديد
لقد حاولت أن أفسر هذه الكلمات بيني وبين نفسي؟ كيف لأمي التي كانت توبخني  بالأمس ان تأتي بكل بساطة و توقظني؟.  لم لازالت تتكلم معي؟ اعلم انني لم اخطئ في شيء لكن عائلتي دائما ما يحاولون جعلي نادمة في كل فرصة تسمح لهم. 💔✋
بعدها بثواني سمعت صوتا اخر.....
- لارا استيقظي لقد تأخر الوقت.!!
 هنا بالفعل أدركت انني لست بحلم
.....
و ما ان حاولت الإستيقاظ حتى لويت قدمي بالخطأ و بدأت بالصراخ....  أسرعت امي وهي تقول بهدوء لقد قال الطبيب أن عليك ان تحاذري في خطواتك قبل ان تتعافي صغيرتي... ✋
هنا بدأت تتبادر الى راسي افكار غريبة ثم تراجعت عن ان اقولها لها ثم قلت...:
امي ايمكنك ان تحكي لي ما حدث بالأمس بالتفصيل منذ ان عدت للبيت؟
ضحكت امي و قالت بالطبع عزيزتي لقد عدتي للبيت و كانت قدمك تنزف جدا و كانت ملابسك مبللة ثم اغمي عليك لانكي تمتلكين فوبيا من الدماء ثم اسرعنا بك للطبيب و أخبرنا انها لا تستطيع المشي هذه الفترة لكن الحمد لله كانت مجرد إصابة طفيفة غير عميقة ثم ضمد جرحك و عدنا للبيت و غطيتي في نوم عميق.... 💚
ثم قلت ماذا.!! ايعني ان نصف المشاهد كانت مجرد كوابيس غبية حلمت بيها.؟
استغربت امي وقالت : ماذا اي مشاهد تتحدثين عنها....
ضربت راسي بخفة و إبتسمت و قلت لا بأس سأجهز نفسي و انزل للطابق السفلي 😔💘
عندها وقفت امي عند باب غرفتي و قالت.... اه في الحقيقة قبل ان تنامي لقد كنتي جالسة على الكرسي تكتبين كلمات بلغة في الحقيقة لم افهمها.؟
لقد حاولت ان ابحث كثيرا عن معاني هذه الكلمات لكنني لم افهمها بحق.!
ثم قلت :- ماذا اي كلمات هذه 🙂
قالت امي: لا بأس لا يهم غيري ملابسك و انزلي عندي مفاجأة لك...امي تعلم انني احب المفاجأة و بشدة أيضا لذلك تحمست كثيرا. 😔
غيرت ملابس نومي و غسلت اسناني و مشطت شعري و نزلت في الدرج بكل هدوء.... الى ان وصلت للاسفل و رأيت م صعب عني تصديقه من الوهلة الاولى..... 😭
ثم قلت في نفسي البوم. 💔😔؟",0,2020-10-01T23:31:13Z

@rochellegaytano8412,"I waited for you
From far away
Cold wind keeps blowing

A very small pinwheel
Just blanking standing there
Looking so lonely as if it’s looking for someone
Felt like I was looking at me

Many things happen
So busy without a breath to catch
Because of this damn world
If I say that’s why we grew apart
Feels like I’m making it up so I have no faults
So I can’t say that
I’m just facing the wind

In the future
So I won’t be sorry
I want to always be waiting
That makes me feel better
Even if you get lost
And it takes you a while
Come round and round back to me
Even if it’s far ahead in the future

People only see the outside
And ask if the wind is cold
They just ask and pass by
Why ask if you’re gonna forget anyway?
Feels like wind from you
So without a word, I’m just waiting

Many things happen
So busy without a breath to catch
Because of this damn world
If I say that’s why we grew apart
Feels like I’m making it up so I have no faults
So I can’t say that
I’m just facing the wind

In the future
So I won’t be sorry
I want to always be waiting
That makes me feel better
Even if you get lost
And it takes you a while
Come round and round back to me
Even if it’s far ahead in the future

Feels like time has hidden
And taken you too
Can’t I see you?
Sometimes, I get bad thoughts
I start to forget you

But don’t cry
It may seem sad
But I’m here
For you

Even if you get lost
And it takes you a while
Come round and round back to me
Even if it’s far ahead in the future",9,2020-09-20T07:44:00Z

I waited for you
From far away
Cold wind keeps blowing
A very small pinwheel
Just blanking standing there
Looking so lonely as if it’s looking for someone
Felt like I was looking at me
 
Many things happen
So busy without a breath to catch
Because of this damn world
If I say that’s why we grew apart
Feels like I’m making it up so I have no faults
So I can’t say that
I’m just facing the wind
 
In the future
So I won’t be sorry
I want to always be waiting, that makes me feel better
Even if you get lost
And it takes you a while
Come round and round back to me
Even if it’s far ahead in the future
 
People only see the outside
And ask if the wind is cold
They just ask and pass by
Why ask if you’re gonna forget anyway?
Feels like wind from you
So without a word, I’m just waiting
 
Many things happen
So busy without a breath to catch
Because of this damn world
If I say that’s why we grew apart
Feels like I’m making it up so I have no faults
So I can’t say that
I’m just facing the wind
 
In the future
So I won’t be sorry
I want to always be waiting, that makes me feel better
Even if you get lost
And it takes you a while
Come round and round back to me
Even if it’s far ahead in the future
 
Feels like time has hidden
And taken you too
Can’t I see you?
Sometimes, I get bad thoughts
I start to forget you
 
But don’t cry
It may seem sad
But I’m here
For you
 
Even if you get lost
And it takes you a while
Come round and round back to me
Even if it’s far ahead in the future",3,2020-09-04T16:16:14Z

1. Make a list of what we need to stream. 
2. Playlist on youtube, spotify.
3. Loop
4. Play it when you're free or cleaning, washing, reviewing, bored, focus on each member, memorize the song, the dance, the angle of their faces, how their hair moves, count the screen time of each member, appreciate the visual, vocal and the choreography. And last, make your final decision of which bias are you.

@Undercover_Carat,"so i don't really expect anyone to respond but i need to write my heart out rn because i don't know who to talk to. so my parents are getting a divorce and at the beginning i felt numb to it and i still kinda do. they always had their little issues and my mom would complain to me every now and then just like i had my own complaints about how my father acted. but i think my mom finally decided that they needed to separate when he overreacted to something my sister did that was just too far. So i know i've been stressed because i've been stress eating and i've probably gained 15 pounds or so in the last month in a half but i didn't understand for sure why i was stressed. like i didn't feel anything when my parents said they were divorcing while my siblings were crying. but i haven't been able to fall asleep very easily this last week or so and i don't know if it's finally hit me but it's like 3:30 am and i started wondering if their divorce could really be the reason i was stressed and just thinking about the divorce, tears starting streaming down my face. Even while typing this i don't know how to feel about it but i keep crying and am close to bawling and i don't know what to do because now i have to manage the stress from the divorce on top of all my schoolwork i got and i just won't stop crying. i really want someone to talk to and seventeen makes me feel a bit better, especially this song. i don't know why but i'm hoping someone will talk to me and tell me why or if everything will be fine or just something. i feel like the only stable thingi have is seventeen and taeyeon. well bye i guess for now",9,2020-08-28T08:28:02Z

But ya some people didn't know abt Svt then know this song. Some of them even say it's their taste.

@queenievillodres3772,"PINWHEEL LYRICS 

I waited for you
From far away
Cold wind keeps blowing
A very small pinwheel
Just blanking standing there
Looking so lonely as if it’s looking for someone
Felt like I was looking at me
 
Many things happen
So busy without a breath to catch
Because of this damn world
If I say that’s why we grew apart
Feels like I’m making it up so I have no faults
So I can’t say that
I’m just facing the wind
 
In the future
So I won’t be sorry
I want to always be waiting, that makes me feel better
Even if you get lost
And it takes you a while
Come round and round back to me
Even if it’s far ahead in the future
 
People only see the outside
And ask if the wind is cold
They just ask and pass by
Why ask if you’re gonna forget anyway?
Feels like wind from you
So without a word, I’m just waiting
 
Many things happen
So busy without a breath to catch
Because of this damn world
If I say that’s why we grew apart
Feels like I’m making it up so I have no faults
So I can’t say that
I’m just facing the wind
 
In the future
So I won’t be sorry
I want to always be waiting, that makes me feel better
Even if you get lost
And it takes you a while
Come round and round back to me
Even if it’s far ahead in the future
 
Feels like time has hidden
And taken you too
Can’t I see you?
Sometimes, I get bad thoughts
I start to forget you
 
But don’t cry
It may seem sad
But I’m here
For you
 
Even if you get lost
And it takes you a while
Come round and round back to me
Even if it’s far ahead in the future",327,2020-07-13T17:27:22Z

@emiscommentingaccount96,"Sorry if I come off as annoying but guys, please stop using em0jis and censor the words f4n f4ct + vi3ws + str3aming because it might be why the vi3ws are frozen for SVT's M/Vs. Just a friendly reminder for those who don't know/forgot: the best way to str3am is to not use playlists- instead, search for the M/Vs manually, watch in 720p or higher, watch 10 min worth of other SVT M/Vs before returning to this one and leave positive comments in the comment section (ex: encouraging other Carats to join in on the str3aming).
Some vids to str3am (the goals are just estimations; I tried to be realistic):
DWC (167.8M) -> 170M ; Clap (76M) -> 80M ; Very Nice (77M) -> 80M
Thanks (47M) -> 50M ; Oh My! (46.8M) -> 50M ; Home (46M) -> 50M
Mansae (43.9M) -> 45M ; HIT (41M) -> 45M
Fear (33M) -> 35M ; Adore U (32M) -> 35M ; Left & Right (43M) -> 60M ; Getting Closer (26M) -> 30M
Just Do It (4.1M) -> 10M ; Snap Shoot (3.7M) -> 5M ; Us, Again (1.9M) -> 4M ; The8 Falling Down (768k) -> 1.5M

@jacklee5399,"I can’t believe I am actually going to write this in public but I just feel like I needed to.

Last year was the toughest time of my life, I had a lot of ups and downs but sadly I ended up in a very bad state of mind where I considered myself worthless and useless always comparing myself to others. I kept up like that for 4 and a half months, until one midnight when I was faintly listen to music looking outside the window. I haven’t even noticed the song changed and went to the next one which was Pinwheel and without me even realizing I was already daydreaming about my future plans my dreams and goals like I usually do when I listen to music I really enjoy, a feeling that at the time I haven’t been feeling for a long time. I couldn’t believe it, this song was making me feel better, this song helped me when I was feeling like shit and miserable. This song, the best, the bridge, the chorus, the lyrics... basically everything about it made me feel better and actually love myself much more. So I just wanted to say that I owe the vocal unit especially Jihoon for writing and producing such a great song that was able to get over my awful memories.

So I just wanted to say, guys, never keep the things that are bothering you from pelope. Talk to someone, trust me it will make you feel better and it’s actually pretty healing to hear support from others.

Peace out, stay cool, don’t take life so serious every time and bye-bye 👋🏻 💛🤍",306,2020-07-07T23:41:25Z

너를 기다리다 바라봤어
저기 저기 멀리 어느 샌가
찬바람이 계속 부는 거 같아
아주 작은 바람개비
혼자 서서 그저 멍하니
누군갈 쓸쓸히 애타게
찾는 게 꼭 나 같아
이런저런 일들
숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐 같은 세상 땜에
너와 내가 멀어진 거라 둘러대면
괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아
그러진 못하고
바람만 맞으며 서있어
먼 훗날 너에게
미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래
그래 그게 더 맘 편해
오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게
다시 찾아와주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도
사람들은 다들 겉으로만
바람이 차지 않냐 물어봐
그냥 그렇게 묻곤 지나가서
다 잊어버릴 거면서 왜 물어봐
너에게서
부는 바람 같아서
그저 아무 말없이
기다릴 뿐인데
이런저런 일들
숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐 같은 세상 땜에

돌고 돌아 내게
다시 찾아와주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도
이 시간은
저 편에 숨어버린 것만 같아
널 데리고
이대로 널 볼 수 없을까
가끔은 안 좋은 생각도 들어 난
네 모습이 잊혀져만 가
그래도 울지마
슬플 거 같지만
희미하게 남아
있는 너를 위해
오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도

I scrolled down the comments and found out why, but honestly, Jeongyeon is right, it's a good song, so who cares? No matter what the reason for coming here to enjoy the song, as long as you enjoyed it, came to like it, then that's all that matters :) As much as I hope to see the comments back to talking about how great this song is being on top when i return again in the distant future, that's probably not gonna happen...

@howlmeow,"너를 기다리다 바라봤어
저기 저기 멀리 어느 샌가
찬 바람이 계속 부는 거 같아

아주 작은 바람개비
혼자 서서 그저 멍하니
누군갈 쓸쓸히 애타게
찾는 게 꼭 나 같아

이런저런 일들
숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐 같은 세상 땜에 너와 내가 멀어진
거라 둘러대면
괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아 그러진 못하고
바람만 맞으며 서있어

먼 훗날 너에게
미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래 그래 그게 더 맘 편해
오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도

사람들은 다를 겉으로만
바람이 차지않냐 물어봐
그냥 그렇게 묻곤 지나가서
다 잊어버릴 거면서 왜 물어봐
너에게서 부는 바람 같아서
그저 아무 말없이 기다릴 뿐인데

이런저런 일들
숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐 같은 세상 땜에 너와 내가 멀어진
거라 둘러대면
괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아 그러진 못하고
바람만 맞으며 서있어

먼 훗날 너에게
미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래 그래 그게 더 맘 편해
오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도

이 시간은 저 편에 숨어버린 것만 같아
널 데리고
이대로 널 볼 수 없을까
가끔은 안 좋은 생각도 들어 난
네 모습이 잊혀져만 가

그래도 울지마
슬플 거 같지만
희미하게 남아
있는 너를 위해

오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도",1,2020-05-03T03:01:22Z

@72EELS,"Vocal unit is always aesthetic. This mv too, I guess.",1,2020-03-11T14:14:14Z
@brain-eatingamoeba,"jeonghan - looking for something unknown, hence unable to exert much effort in his exploration.

joshua - waiting for something, but there is uncertainty whether or not that something will come.

woozi - doesn't know where he is physically, maybe even mentally and so on, but he definitely already has a goal in mind.

dokyeom - reminiscing events from the past wherein he visits the empty court, doesn't look sad at all, almost appearing bittersweet and having no regrets of what his past contained, just sits there and listens to some tunes while he's at it.

seungkwan - looks like he's in the stage of suffering, what caused him pain must've been really big because he spends a lot of time brooding inside his car that was broken down in the middle of the road. it's evident that he tries to seek help at first that time when he gets out of the car, but eventually gives up, gets back in the car and proceeds being in his gloomy state.

thank you for reading this! this is just my opinion on what i observed in this mv. 

have a nice day~! :'>",1,2020-03-11T05:51:54Z

@reina1015reina,"너를 기다리다 바라봤어
저기 저기 멀리 어느샌가
찬 바람이 계속 부는 것 같아
아주 작은 바람개비
혼자서 그저 멍하니
누군가를 쓸쓸히 애타게
찾는 게 꼭 나 같아
이런저런 일들
숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐같은 세상 땜에 너와 내가 멀어진
거라 둘러대면
괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아 그러지 못하고
바람만 맞으며 서있어
먼 훗날 너에게
미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래 그래 그게 더 맘 편해
오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와 주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도
사람들은 다를 겉으로만
바람이 차지 않냐 물어봐
그냥 그렇게 묻고 지나갔어
다 잊어버릴 거면서 왜 물어봐
너에게서 부른 바람 같아서
그저 아무 말 없이 기다릴 뿐인데
이런저런 일들
숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐같은 세상 땜에 너와 내가 멀어진
거라 둘러대면
괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아 그러지 못하고
바람만 맞으며 서있어
먼 훗날 너에게
미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래 그래 그게 더 맘 편해
오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와 주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도
이 시간은 저 편에 숨어버린 것만 같아
널 데리러
이대로 널 볼 수 없을까
가끔은 안 좋은 생각도 들러 난
니 모습이 잊혀져만 가
그래도 울지마
슬플 것 같지만
희미하게 남아
웃는 너를 위해
오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와 주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도",1,2019-11-15T08:46:16Z

@Laura.hrtmnn,"When I listen to this song I feel like it's Fall and I'm sitting in an old Bus driving down a lonely english country road. It's definitely not warm outside, but it's not really cold either and I can feel a light breeze streaking my face. When I look up to the Sky I see a field of light grey clouds, so it's conceivable that it'll rain today. I rest my head against the cool windowpane and suddenly I want to get off the bus. Slowly I walk to the front and ask the driver if it would be okay to stop the bus for a second. The middle-aged man gives me a blank look, but stops the vehicle, so a few people start mumbling, because of the unplanned stop in the middle of nowhere. I take a step and am now surrounded by cool, pure Fall air. The last thing I hear is the door of the old vehicle, closing behind my back with a squeaking, unpleasent noise and then I watch the Bus in which I was sitting just a minute ago, slowly disappearing in the distance and suddenly I realize that I'm now alone on this lonely road. Nobody else. Not a single soul. Miles far. Along the road endless, long meadows of knee-high, fresh, dark-green grass are spreading, like a carpet on countless hills and valleys. And then I walk. Not knowing why I took this path with an unknown end, but I walk. And this song is playing in my head.
Btw sorry for my grammar I suck at English lol",1,2019-08-04T22:33:47Z

[Verse 1: 정한, 승관]
너를 기다리다 바라봤어
저기 저기 멀리 어느샌가
찬바람이 계속 부는거 같아

아주 작은 바람개비
혼자 서서 그저 멍하니
누군가 쓸쓸히 애타게 찾는게
꼭 나같아

[Pre-Chorus: 도겸]
이런저런 일들 숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐 같은 세상 때문에
너와 내가 멀어진 거라 둘러대면
괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아
그러지 못하고 바람만 맞으며 서있어

[Chorus: 우지, 조슈아]
먼훗날 너에게 미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래 그래 그게 더 맘편해

오는 길을 잃어 오래 걸린데도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면돼
먼훗날이라도

[Verse 2: 도겸, 조슈아]
사람들은 다들 겉으로만
바람이 차지 않냐 물어봐
그냥 그렇게 묻곤 지나가서
다 잊어버릴 거면서 왜 물어봐

너에게서 부는 바람 같아서
그저 아무 말없이 기다릴 뿐인데

[Pre-Chorus: 승관]
이런저런 일들 숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐 같은 세상 때문에
너와 내가 멀어진 거라 둘러대면
괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아
그러지 못하고 바람만 맞으며 서있어

[Chorus: 우지, 정한]
먼훗날 너에게 미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래 그래 그게 더 맘편해

오는 길을 잃어 오래 걸린데도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면돼
먼훗날이라도

[Bridge: 도겸, 승관]
이 시간은 저편에 숨어버린 것만 같아 널 데리고
이대로 널 볼 수 없을까
가끔은 안 좋은 생각도 들어 난
니 모습이 잊혀져만 가
[Pre-Chorus: 우지]
그래도 울지마
슬플 거 같지만
희미하게 남아
웃는 너를 위해

[Chorus: 정한, 조슈아]
오는 길을 잃어 오래 걸린데도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면돼
먼훗날이라도",7,2019-04-11T15:09:22Z

@o0o-d4b,"너를 기다리다 바라봤어
저기 저기 멀리 어느 샌가
찬바람이 계속 부는 거 같아

아주 작은 바람개비
혼자 서서 그저 멍하니
누군갈 쓸쓸히 애타게
찾는 게 꼭 나 같아

이런저런 일들
숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐 같은 세상 땜에
너와 내가 멀어진 거라 둘러대면

괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아
그러진 못하고
바람만 맞으며 서있어

먼 훗날 너에게
미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래
그래 그게 더 맘 편해

오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게
다시 찾아와주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도

사람들은 다들 겉으로만
바람이 차지않냐 물어봐
그냥 그렇게 묻곤 지나가서
다 잊어버릴 거면서 왜 물어봐

너에게서 
부는 바람 같아서
그저 아무 말없이
기다릴 뿐인데

이런저런 일들
숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐 같은 세상 땜에
너와 내가 멀어진 거라 둘러대면

괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아
그러진 못하고
바람만 맞으며 서있어

먼 훗날 너에게
미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래
그래 그게 더 맘 편해

오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게
다시 찾아와주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도

이 시간은 저 편에 숨어버린 것만 같아
널 데리고

이대로 널 볼 수 없을까
가끔은 안 좋은 생각도 들어 난
네 모습이 잊혀져만 가

그래도 울지마
슬플 거 같지만
희미하게 남아
있는 너를 위해

오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게
다시 찾아와주면 돼

먼 훗날이라도",3,2019-03-17T10:02:43Z

I've just been a carat for three months and I've just listened their title tracks songs 
It's becuz I thought that if the songs are not attracting
But I'm wrong
Even though it is not their title songs, it is still so AMAZING
I'm slowly listening all of their songs now, especially the songs from vocal team
I can't describe how talented and amazing of all their songs
They really used all their heart and effort to all their songs
I really really love them and they are also giving all their best to us
Stan talent, stan SEVENTEEN 💎

@황지영-b6m,"너를 기다리다 바라봤어
저기 저기 멀리 어느 샌가
찬바람이 계속 부는 거 같아

아주 작은 바람개비
혼자 서서 그저 멍하니
누군갈 쓸쓸히 애타게
찾는 게 꼭 나 같아

이런저런 일들
숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐 같은 세상 땜에
너와 내가 멀어진 거라 둘러대면

괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아
그러진 못하고
바람만 맞으며 서있어

먼 훗날 너에게
미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래
그래 그게 더 맘 편해

오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게
다시 찾아와주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도

사람들은 다들 겉으로만
바람이 차지않냐 물어봐
그냥 그렇게 묻곤 지나가서
다 잊어버릴 거면서 왜 물어봐

너에게서 
부는 바람 같아서
그저 아무 말없이
기다릴 뿐인데

이런저런 일들
숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐 같은 세상 땜에
너와 내가 멀어진 거라 둘러대면

괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아
그러진 못하고
바람만 맞으며 서있어

먼 훗날 너에게
미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래
그래 그게 더 맘 편해

오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게
다시 찾아와주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도

이 시간은 저 편에 숨어버린 것만 같아
널 데리고

이대로 널 볼 수 없을까
가끔은 안 좋은 생각도 들어 난
네 모습이 잊혀져만 가

그래도 울지마
슬플 거 같지만
희미하게 남아
있는 너를 위해

오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게
다시 찾아와주면 돼

먼 훗날이라도",0,2018-11-28T12:45:13Z

@carrot8576,"three truths of life:
3) the sun will always set
2) the sun will always rise 
1) svt vocal unit is under appreciated

hello since people don’t look at the replies and all these comments are stressing me out; when i made this comment i meant that i personally thought seventeen's VOCAL unit was underrated, not seventeen as a group. I KNOW that seventeen is not an underrated group and i am so proud of them for the success they have gained and the hard work they put in everyday. I just thought that the vocalists and their individual talents were going under the radar and people were missing out on their abilities because vocal unit songs like these were not getting nearly enough attention. Now I can see that is absolutely not the case because hell yeah our boys are b r e a k i n g records. I am happy to see that they are getting the attention they deserve and people are recognising the vocal unit. I'm sorry if i've gone and offended someone by saying that seventeen are underrated because they most certainly are not and I absolutely see that.",4907,2018-11-11T08:30:45Z

@greisly8114,"IMAGINE TIME!
It was late summer and it had been raining. Just a few hours ago you shivered in coldness as the hard shower suddenly poured on your way home, but now it had calmed down, the sky was still cloudy and grey, but it's nicer than the bright scorching sun. You walked out of the bus shelter and continued your way back home to your grandma's place in the country yard. 

Wide field of grass on your left and right as you walked on the old asphalt road where vehicle rarely pass give you a sense of peace. The cold air tickled your skin but it's okay. ""The summer really is ending."" You mumbled. 

You closed your eyes and hummed the song you always heard when you're still able to reach to youtube with your phone before spending your summer holiday in your grandma's house. A ring of bell made you jolt opened your eyes.

""Hi [Name]! It's pouring hard just now, right?"" A boy who's riding his bicycle slow down and step down from his bike to walk with you. You only nodded. The cold wind once again blow trough, making the water droplet on the leaves fall down. He shivered but smiled nonetheless. ""Summer is ending."" 

He sighed, ""you're going home soon."" He smiled sheepishly. You turned to face him, ""i can come again next summer."" He grinned, ""really? Will you come again next year?!"" You nodded.

And so here you are. 3 years later, never actually saw him again, even after coming back and forth every summer. ""He has been busy with his job for the past years"" they said. 

The rain poured again a few hours ago and you walk the same asphalt, except now being alone. Droplet of rain fall down the grass on the field on your right and left, a few puddles of water on the road create reflection of dull grey sky. You kicked the water on one of the puddle.

""Such a liar,"" you said to yourself. You can already see your grandma's house when a ring of bell make your eyes widen. You turn around. 

""Long time no see."" He said. You nodded. ""It's pouring hard just now, right?"" The wind blow trough his now different coloured hairs. ""The summer is ending."" 

""You're going home soon, right?"" You ask him. He smiled sheepishly. ""I can't promise i can come again next spring."" You closed your eyes and sighed. 

""Are you still hearing songs from youtube?"" You open your eyes and stare at him. ""Yeah, i do."" He grinned, ""i see,"" He fish out his phone from his pocket and show you a video. ""My group,"" He proudly stated, ""i thought that you may like this kind of song."" 

You giggled. ""Thanks."" The cold air blows again. ""I think i will come again next summer."" 

You tighten your grip on his phone and smile, ""i hope you can."" He patted your head and grinned, ""until that time, you can do what you want, but when it's time, make sure you're empty, kay? Because i'm the one who will fill your heart.""

You feel warm and can feel heat snuck up your face even with the cold wind blow trough. ""I'll wait, [Bias Name]""",0,2018-06-29T20:18:16Z
@haechan7653,"_this song_ makes me feel so nostalgic and really calms me down, these past few days have really been stressful.

_this song_ really just makes me want to run through a field of flowers, the sun shining really brightly and not really giving a care in the world. 

_this song_ makes me want to be hugged by someone special, to be told that everything is ok.

いつの日か君に心苦しさを感じぬよう

ぬる なん きだりるれ
늘 난 가다릴래
いつまでも僕は待っているよ

くれ くげ ど まむ ぴょね
그래 그게 더 맘 편해
その方が気持ちが楽だから


おぬん きるる いろ おれ ごるりんでど
오는 길을 잃어 오래 걸린대도
来る道の途中で迷い 時間がかかったとしても

とるご どら ねげ たし ちゃじゃわじゅみょん どぇ
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면 돼
巡り巡ってまた僕のところに来てくれればいい

もん ふんなりらど
먼 훗날이라도
いつの日にか



い しがぬん ちょ ぴょね すもぼりん こんまん がた
이 시간은 저 편에 숨어버린 것만 같아
この時間は向こう側に隠れてしまったみたいだ

のる てりご
널 데리고
君を連れて


いでろ のる ぼる す おぷするっか
이대로 널 볼 수 없을까
このまま君に会えなくなってしまうんだろうか

かっくむん あん じょうん せんがくど とぅろ なん
가끔은 안 좋은 생각도 들어 난
時々そんな悪い考えが浮かぶこともある

に もすび いちょじょまん が
네 모습이 잊혀져만 가
君の姿が忘れられていく


くれど うるじま
그래도 울지마
それでも泣いちゃだめだ

するぷん こ がっちまん
슬픈 거 같지만
悲しいかもしれないけれど

ひみはげ なま いんぬん のるる うぃへ
희미하게 남아 있는 너를 위해
かすかに残っている君のために


おぬん きるる いろ おれ こるりんでど
오는 길을 잃어 오래 걸린대도
来る道の途中で迷い 時間がかかったとしても

とるご どら ねげ たし ちゃじゃわじゅみょん どぇ

@caratsareablinktoarmy5287,"I decided to write whatever i thought abt the song (theory)


Here as you see the members are holding a ring,which is not theirs but another member's.All members are looking for a certain something except Joshua who is wondering in the empty roads, underground passage,etc.Jeonghan is writing a letter,Seungkwan is looking for Joshua while driving *he came to the road where Joshua was walking*,Woozi is in a city looking for something which is not a thing but a person (which i think its Joshua).and Dk is waiting.
Here the reason why think the members are looking for Joshua is bc he doesn't show his ring while the others do and he is slowly walking doesn't seem to be looking for something.in the end Joshua runs to get back to the members and the members (somehow has a feeling that he is coming and runs back to the place where everything started; probably where the piano is bc its the only place which properly shows them together)



Idk but it kinda makes sense.right?",57,2018-04-06T09:18:55Z

@gayatri-ydkh,"English Translation:🌿🌿🌿🌿🌧🌧🌧

I’ve been looking forward to see you , which ways, is Taht far away over there?
It’s like the cold wind keeps blowing

The very small Pinwheel standing alone
It’s like staring while waiting for someone desperately
It’s like me doing things breathlessly

With so many things , going around breathlessly
With type of world is this where we keep getting further away
It’s like I’ve done nothing wrong
It’s just like decorating but I can’t even do that
And just stand there while getting hit by the wind

To you is the distant future , I won’t be sorry
Always waiting for me yeah that’s easier

Losing the way here even it takes a long time
Turning round and round as long as you find me again in the distant future

People on the outside, ask me if I get hit by the wind
They just ask that and pass by
If you’re going to lose me again why did your ask

To you it’s like calling the wind ,
just waiting with no words


With so many things , going around breathlessly
With type of world is this where we keep getting further away
It’s like I’ve done nothing wrong
It’s just like decorating but I can’t even do that
And just stand there while getting hit by the wind

To you is the distant future , I won’t be sorry
Always waiting for me yeah that’s easier

Losing the way here even it takes a long time
Turning round and round as long as you find me again
In the distant future

This time it’s like hiding you by my side, to take you

I can’t see you like this
Sometimes I have bad thoughts
Like forgetting your appearance

But I still don’t cry even though it seems sad
Remain dim, smiling for you

Losing the way here even it takes a long time
Turning round and round as long as you find me again
In the distant future",1,2017-12-26T16:44:36Z

@dianamontoya6895,"This song I like very much, but after seeing the presentation in the MAMAS, of the song of BOA, I think it would be an excellent idea that the VOCAL TEAM had a more moving song. I love Woozi's ballads, but I would inject a lot of energy so they would have a more lively dance in a song style of the performance team. Finally, we already know that everyone is dancing very well and that would help them to be better known. Well, it's just an opinion, but it would be a golden dream for me to come true.

@_nyamnyam_,"너를 기다리다 바라봤어
저기 저기 멀리 어느 샌가
찬바람이 계속 부는 거 같아

아주 작은 바람개비
혼자 서서 그저 멍하니
누군갈 쓸쓸히 애타게
찾는 게 꼭 나 같아

이런저런 일들
숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐 같은 세상 땜에
너와 내가 멀어진 거라 둘러대면

괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아
그러진 못하고
바람만 맞으며 서있어

먼 훗날 너에게
미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래
그래 그게 더 맘 편해

오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게
다시 찾아와주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도

사람들은 다들 겉으로만
바람이 차지않냐 물어봐
그냥 그렇게 묻곤 지나가서
다 잊어버릴 거면서 왜 물어봐

너에게서 
부는 바람 같아서
그저 아무 말없이
기다릴 뿐인데

이런저런 일들
숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐 같은 세상 땜에
너와 내가 멀어진 거라 둘러대면

괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아
그러진 못하고
바람만 맞으며 서있어

먼 훗날 너에게
미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래
그래 그게 더 맘 편해

오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게
다시 찾아와주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도

이 시간은 저 편에 숨어버린 것만 같아
널 데리고

이대로 널 볼 수 없을까
가끔은 안 좋은 생각도 들어 난
네 모습이 잊혀져만 가

그래도 울지마
슬플 거 같지만
희미하게 남아
있는 너를 위해

오는 길을 잃어
오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게
다시 찾아와주면 돼

먼 훗날이라도",0,2017-11-12T12:00:41Z

저기 저기 멀리 어느샌가
찬바람이 계속 부는 것 같아

아주 작은 바람개비
혼자 서서 그저 멍하니
누군가를 쓸쓸히 애타게
찾는 게 꼭 나 같아

이런 저런 일들 숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐 같은 세상 땜에
너와 내가 멀어진 거라 둘러대면
괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아
그러지 못하고
바람만 맞으며 서있어

먼 훗날 너에게
미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래 그래 그게 더 맘편해

오는 길을 잃어 오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아 와 주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도

사람들은 다들 겉으로만
바람이 차지 않냐 물어봐
그냥 그렇게 묻곤 지나가서
다 잊어버릴 거면서 왜 물어봐

너에게서 부는 바람 같아서
그저 아무 말없이 기다릴 뿐인데

이런 저런 일들 숨가쁘게 바쁜 
이 뭐 같은 세상 땜에
너와 내가 멀어진 거라 둘러대면
괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼
꾸며내는 것만 같아
그러지 못하고
바람만 맞으며 서있어

먼 훗날 너에게
미안하지않게
늘 난 기다릴래 그래 그게 더 맘 편해

오는 길을 잃어 오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도

이 시간은 저 편에
숨어버린 것만 같아
널 데리고

이대로 널 볼 수 없을까
가끔은 안좋은 생각도 들어 난
니 모습이 잊혀져만 가

그래도 울지마
슬플거 같지만
희미하게 남아 있는 너를 위해

오는 길을 잃어 오래 걸린대도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면 돼
먼 훗날이라도

@jrmy__,"This will be probably my favorite out of the 4 releases so far :)

1. *Pinwheel*
2. *Change Up*
3. *Lilili Yabbay* (my least fave SVT Perf song, I loved all their previous stuffs)
4. *Trauma* (i dunno why, i think their hiphop is not my cup of  tea, i didn't even liked their previous one, Check In(?))

And yeah btw I only recognize Woozi, Seungkwan, Vernon, S.Coups & Jeonghan and I still don't know and identify the others but I knew all the names even tho I'm not an actual fan . xD",6,2017-10-18T11:45:28Z

@kikis.video.service,"Honestly I have encountered so many Korean groups that were/are amazing so far, but I keep on coming back to Seventeen.
They never fail to surprise me with their talent, doing everything on their own and showing variety, always trying out new styles, always reinterpreting themselves and never letting the quality suffer whilst doing so.
Those boys are honestly one of the best, most hard-working and versatile bands I have ever seen and it hurts my little heart that a lot of people tend to overlook them only due to them being so many members...I pity those people on missing out on such talent and the sheer happiness that they bring. 
(And I am ashamed that I once was just as ignorant as them regarding the amount of members too). 
...All I know now is that I will continue to always come back to my one true family of 13 wonderful human beings that are talented and precious beyond words - keep on fighting, my 13 beautiful diamonds! I will always try to find you, even in the distant future! 😊💞",436,2017-10-17T21:02:20Z

1. Compass in DWC
2. Telephone in DWC
3. Piano in VERY NICE
4. Car in Pretty U
5. Soccer Field in Mansae
6. Walls/Fences in BoomBoom

Theories:
1. They run at the end, means running away from their old concepts. Changing up.
2. Summary of their hardships before Al1.

@carrietulip,"Okay so after I got over my general fangirling I started thinking about how heavily this video (particulary the ending) correlates with the Al1 teasers from before. I also earlier (probably stupidly) assumed that these songs were the bridge between Al1 and the next comback, but I feel as if it's obviously a prequel of sorts. I was confused that it was 0.5 when 1.5 would be more accurate if it was the bridge between chapter 1 and 2 but if it's set before Al1 I wonder how that fits within the narrative. Woozi is shown holding a stopwatch, likely the one Vernon was holding in his teaser, and the one DK was using when he was trapped in his time loop of sorts. Joshua is by a phone. In the teasers it was Joshua who left those sad voicemails. I'm not sure when/how this video fits into the narrative, if it's set before or after the teasers but either way there is something going on with the plot here. My memory might be a bit hazy about some of the details of the teasers and i'll re-watch them before we get new content but honeslty I think it's really clever of Seventeen and that we are stanning the right group. Thanks if you read all this, lol",1,2017-10-17T05:01:25Z

People talking about him and his visuals is a very rare occurence and now it's finally happening. i am so freaking happy. I am DK and Jun biased and in their units' MVs, carats have been talking about things that they rarely talked about them before (Jun's vocals, DK's visuals). Since early this year, my biases from other groups have been getting more and more recognition and I am so glad it's happening for my biases in svt as well. This has been a year for my biases and I can't thank y'all enough for hyping them up. They deserve this so freaking much. <3",368,2017-10-17T03:59:06Z

누군가 쓸쓸히 애타게 찾는게 
꼭 나같아

이런저런 일들을 숨가쁘게 바쁜
이 뭐 같은 세상 때문에
너와 내가 멀어진 거라 둘러대면
괜히 나는 잘못 없는 거처럼 
꾸며내는 것만 같아
그러지 못하고 바람만 맞으며 서있어

(우지)
먼훗날 너에게 미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래 그래 그게 더 맘편해

오는 길을 잃어 오래 걸린데도
돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와주면돼
먼훗날이라도

사람들은 다들 겉으로만 
바람이 차지 않냐 물어봐
그냥 그렇게 묻곤 지나가서 
다 잊어버릴 거면서 왜 물어봐

너에게서 부는 바람 같아서
그저 아무 말없이 기다릴 뿐인데

가끔은 안좋은 생각도 들어 난

@dianamontoya6895,"Estuve esperando al Vocal Team con ansiedad. En realidad, aunque todo el grupo me gusta mucho, no hay nadie que escriba mejores baladas que Woozi. Realmente este chico es genial y me parece que con cada canción que hace, se supera a si mismo. Amo la manera en la que se hace la introducción del piano con la primera toma de sus hermosas manos y me llena de expectativas que se van superando cada segundo según se van enfocando a cada chico.  Yo soy una persona de 20 años, pero mi espiritu es muy tranquilo y prefiero que no haya rap en las canciones, aunque repito, todas las canciones de SVT me agradan mucho y soy Carat con mucho orgullo. Los colores del video son inmejorables y ellos, que no son actores, nos dan una idea de la melancolía de la letra. Espero que, como siempre, tengan mucha aceptación y se vayan afianzando en el gusto de la gente como un grupo que, uniendo a los tres equipos, siempre trabaja y se esfuerza para entregar música hermosa y llena de talento.

One day I'll get older and I may not be a Kpop fan anymore or enjoy it like I used to but I'll never forget how this song and many others and these boys made me feel.,11,2017-10-16T20:30:49Z

@m.nyaaa_,"[정한] 너를 기다리다 바라봤어 저기 저기 멀리 어느샌가 찬 바람이 계속 부는 것 같아 
[승관] 아주 작은 바람개비 혼자 서서 그저 멍하니 누군가 쓸쓸히 애타게 찾는 게 꼭 나 같아
[도겸] 이런저런 일들을 숨가쁘게 바쁜 이 뭐 같은 세상 때문에 너와 내가 멀어진 거라 둘러대면 괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼 꾸며내는 것만 같아 그러지 못 하고 바람만 맞으며 서 있어
[우지] 먼 훗날 너에게 미안하지 않게 늘 나 기다릴래 그래 그게 더 맘 편해
[조슈아] 오는 길을 잃어 오래 걸린대도 돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와 주면 돼 먼 훗날이라도
[도겸] 사람들은 다들 겉으로만 바람이 차지 않냐 물어봐 그냥 그렇게 묻곤 지나가서 다 잊어 버릴 거면서 왜 물어봐
[조슈아] 너에게서 부는 바람 같아서 그저 아무 말 없이 기다릴 뿐인데 
[승관] 이런저런 일들을 숨가쁘게 바쁜 이 뭐 같은 세상 때문에 너와 내가 멀어진 거라 둘러대면 괜히 나는 잘못 없는 것처럼 꾸며내는 것만 같아 그러지 못 하고 바람만 맞으며 서 있어
[우지] 먼 훗날 너에게 미안하지 않게 늘 나 기다릴래 그래 그게 더 맘 편해
[정한] 오는 길을 잃어 오래 걸린대도 돌고 돌아 내게 다시 찾아와 주면 돼 먼 훗날이라도
[도겸] 이 시간은 저편에 숨어 버린 것만 같아 널 데리고
[승관] 이대로 널 볼 수 없을까 가끔은 안 좋은 생각도 들어 난 네 모습이 잊혀져만 가
[우지] 그래도 울지 마 슬플 것 같지만 희미하게 남아 있는 나를 위해

@DyahAzman,"English lyricsssss!!! I cried T^T its so beautiful 😭 the lyrics the melody everything is on point :')

[JH] I wait and hope to see you
On that day one day far ahead
Where the cold wind seems to keep on blowing

[SK] A very small pinwheel
Its standing alone and just blankly
Looking for someone anxiously and a bit lonely just like me

[DK] One thing and another with the busy world
Where even breathing is hard
What if I said they were why you and I become distant
As if I never made mistakes
It feels so made up that I cant do it
So Im just standing here while feeling the wind

Chorus *
[WZ] To you in the far future
Without regrets
I always wanna wait
That way, my heart will be at ease

[JS] Although you'll lose the way
Though it will be a bit long
While you're going round and round but its fine if you find me again
Even if it's far in the future

[DK] Everyone are just not involved deeply
They ask ""Isn't the wind cold?""
They ask that and walk away
If you're going to forget them all, why ask in the first place?

[JS] I thought the wind was blown by you
So i just keep waiting in silence

[SK] One thing and another with the busy world
Where even breathing is hard
What if I said they were why you and I become distant
As if I never made mistakes
It feels so made up that I cant do it
So Im just standing here while feeling the wind

Chorus *
[WZ] To you in the far future
Without regrets
I always wanna wait
That way, my heart will be at ease

[JH] Although you'll lose the way
Though it will be a bit long
While you're going round and round but its fine if you find me again
Even if it's far in the future

[DK] This time I feel like you hide in that side, I'll come for you
[SK] This way, cant i see you again?
These day where I also think of bad things
Only the face of you that's fading from my mind 

[WZ] But still dont cry
Though it will be sad
I will faintly stay here for you

[JH] Although you'll lose the way
Though it will be a bit long
[JH & DK] While you're going round and round but its fine if you find me again
[JS] Even if it's far in the future

@hannaraisyamuljawan,"The first time i heard this song, i got goosebumps from how melancholily beautiful the music is.
The second time i heard this song with the lyrics translation as a guide, i got goosebumps from how touching the lyrics actually were. 
The third time i hear this song while observing the MV closely, my heart squeezed.

I knew that SEVENTEEN has a way with emotions and such, but damn son this MV by far took the cherry to the cake! Vocal team never disappoint in terms of making the heart flutter!

SEVENTEEN has matured so much in terms of music, performance and as group. From the Adore U era 'till now, they've come a long long way. I couldn't help be excited yet scared of this quick development that they're constantly showing in every comeback. It feels like they're growing up too fast, like a child that suddenly became an adult... that kind of feeling. Haha looks like i didn't want to admit that they're no longer the monster rookie but already a veteran in the industry.",34,2017-10-16T09:29:56Z

@grace24690,"Attention Carats! Here are the View Count goals for this comeback. Make sure to like this so more carats can see! Let's work hard to get our boys the views and recognition they deserve! 

 We know first-hand how much work they put into DWC, and so we need to work extra hard this year with this comeback to ensure that next time, they get the recognition they deserve! 

Here are the goals for this comeback! These are the minimum, let's try and do all we can!

All separate unit video songs:

Change Up : 4.5 million views 
Trauma: 3.5 million views 
Lilili Yabbay: 2.5 million views
Pinwheel: 2 million views

For the comeback title track, we want to try and achieve 3.5 million views in 24 hours. I know we can do it!

 Let's give back to these boys and show them how much we appreciate their hard work. They've put so much into this for us and it's time we got them the recognition they deserve. Like this post so more carats can see and know what's up! Xx",15,2017-10-16T08:36:58Z

I know most carats will just sweep this under the rug and call me names, but this is serious.

It reminds me of a time when I wasn't able, or strong enough, to stop the bad things that happened to me, and I can only look at my past self in regret. But there's still hope. Life will push you around like wind going through a wheel, even when you've done nothing wrong except be yourself, so you just have to endure it for a while and get ""hit by the wind"". But you wont regret your endurance, for one day in the future you'll look back and be glad that you didn't let yourself be broken down by the wind i.e the judgements of others. Well that's at least how I interpret it...",2,2017-10-16T07:58:51Z

@eejunesoh7270,"I have so much feelings in this mv 😭😭😭😭😭
Just at the beginning i straight away know this is my kind of jam TT 
The piano OMG (Where's my wig OH NVM

Jeonghan is ALWAYS my ultimate bias 
He is just too beautiful as a human TT He is our fallen angel to purify our hearts 💕 I felt so clear and moved (?) after listening to his voice with the lines 
PS I like jh when he sings roughly(?) like the one in Decalcomanie and here in the chorus 💕💕💕 His voice is perfecti with this kind of concept 💯 
PS* I like that shot where jeonghan's fingers is touching the piano TT So SOFT!!!! TT 

Seungkwannie TT I saw someone on Twitter saying that he can be actress as well TT Totally agree!!! The one shot that he's in the car TT He looks so sad 😭 DID BONON HEART YOU TT 
His vocals is perfect as always That soft and hard kinda voice is what this song needs 😭😭😭 

Seokmin OMG What happen to his visuals???? I knew he was a gorgeous looking hot af but BUT!!!!!! He looks so soft with the sweater 😭😭😭 I wanna hug him HIS JAWLINE CAN KILL ME OMGGGGGG DOES SEOKMIN PARENTS KNOW THAT?? HE'S KILLIN PPL TT 
Sorry lemme just shocked for his visuals ahahah He's voice is beautiful as always That soft and calming voice will cure you from sadness I CANT GET OVER IT SEOKMIN AHHHHHHHH IM LOYAL TO JH BUT- 

JIHOON AGAIN OMGGGGGGG Tbh Jihoon is not really in my bias list before BUT BUT BUT after his hair dyed to maroon red he keeps on crashing my  bias list again (NOW OFFICIALLY I HAVE 1ULTIMATE BIAS AND 12BIAS WRECKER BLESS YOU YJH 
THIS CHORUS KILLS ME (UNTIL DK's part I still left with 10% ) JIHOONIE DADDY TT His part makes me cry LIKE REALLY TTTT WHO MAKES YOU BECOME THAT SAD WHOOOOOOOO 
PS That shot where he's in the middle of the road wearing that red suit is where I felt the most emotional TT 

Joshuji IM LITERALLY SHOCK HOW FINE HE IS 🚨 🚨 🚨 IS IT EVEN LEGAL???? HELLO POLICE- SHUAAAAAA His voice is like the last sip of a fav meal YOU FEEL SATISFIED AND WILL START THINKING WHEN IS THE NEXT TIME HAVING IT Makes a lerfect ending 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

SUMMARY: STAN TALENT STAN ANGEL STAN VISUALS STAN SEVENTEEN 

Thanks for reading such a long comment TT🙇🏻‍♀️🙇🏻‍♀️🙇🏻‍♀️🙇🏻‍♀️ This is my 2nd fav song after PRETTY YOU TT(Anyone???)  I LOVE YOU SVT TT No other groups can snatch my heart like you do",71,2017-10-16T07:58:02Z

@nicolelagunsad7841,"I HAVE COME IN PEACE WITH SOME THEORIES THAT I MADE (from Paola Mae 's comment) SO THAT WE ALL CAN CONTRIBUTE AND DISSIMINATE THE INFORMATION. IF I FIND SOME MORE, I'LL SURELY UPDATE THIS.

Joshua was trying to call Hoshi . Hoshi then tried to call him back but Joshua didn't answer ? (I blame bad middle of the highway reception). Seeing as they couldn't get a hold of each other, Joshua just left that message for Hoshi and then... We can see Jun descending down the stairs at the end of Hoshi's trailer. He founds the damned telephone plays it and tada~~~

I'll also be sharing a few of my observations:

~Isn't that Habit (instrumental ver.) playing at Jun's Al1 teaser? Please tell me that I'm not being delusional.

~ If this is CHAPTER 0.5 then why is Woozi in possession of Vernon's compass? Maybe the compass was Woozi's to begin with and he gave it to Vernon. Vernon returned it in the trailer because he found sense in life, his 'direction' using Woozi's compass and maybe its time he returned it to Woozi for him to find his way back to his direction. I dunno, fam. I dunno. 

~Why is Jeonghan holding a ring when he already got his? 0:20  I assume its from one of the members, but I looked at it and didn't see the edge of the square design of their ring. Yeah I would need some clarifications.

~Is it worth mentioning that Jeonghan is writing again? He is writing something from his trailer and he is writing something now.

~Is it also worth mentioning that there are fences and running ? Maybe Pinwheel's concept is similar to Young and Free by BTS. BTS is running away from the past and all that other things, but there is a difference. BTS are contained inside a maze , but Vocal team is staring at something from far away and the fence is keeping them from getting what they want. 

~Wonwoo at the end of Mingyu's Al1 trailer and at his Al1 trailer... You see some of his shots there are the same in those of Trauma. Maybe even before and during Al1 he is suffering from depression or some other kind, but I don't want to dwell much into it .

~ there are some things that needed theories in Trauma... one being the meaning of each of their rooms or 'boxes'. the mirrors. the members standing on each of the corners of the box platform thing.  Meanie tied to the rope. But then we just wait for more from Pledis and Seventeen to make sense if these things.

~I haven't checked out what things to be theorized in CHANGE UP because boi, I don't wanna go back there again. i'll drown with all those visuals. 

~In LILILI YABBAY (I prefer to call it that bc its fun to say), I have been thinking about the bystanders. I counted them they are 14 innocent people who are alive and having the time of their lives. Then they ended up on the floor at the end of LILILI YABBAY. I thought they are gonna be 13 because 1) 13 members and 2) 13 bystanders  + 4 dancing gods = 17 

THAT ENDS MY LITTLE SEGMENT! Thank you for wasting your time reading and comprehending this massive chunk of words. I'll edit this when new sht drops because you'll never know with Pledis. 

Have I ever told you that SEVENTEEN is VISUALTEEN ? That's all.

I HAVE FINALLY USED THIS BRAIN TO CONTRIBUTE MEANINGFULLY TO BUILDING THE NATION AND IMPROVING THE STATE OF TECHNOLOGY AND FINE STANNING! I can die in peace

UPDATE:

I'm alive and spotted some things in TRAUMA. 

~EACH ROOM HAS ONE WINDOW except Vernon's and S.Coup's roof holes. (I swear boi fix that dam roof)

~Vernon's room is designed to be that of a kid's. You can see that he has a door and an exhaust fan with a window. The sand is a symbolism for his childhood when he ' basically have no friends.' You can also see him using his earphones as his escape. This childhood room theory is supported by the cameo of Hiphop team in their rooms in one straight line shot where Vernon sits in his sand hill cross legged and listening to music thru his earphones.

~ Vernon lying down on those beds stands for him being lonely despite having all the comfortable things in life. 

~9 electric fans? Must be something special to Hansol.

~Mingyu's trauma or section or lines kinda sums up the story of the HIPHOP team: how their trauma inspires them to sing, how they sing to try and fight their trauma. 

~ I saw a shot of Mingyu beside Cheol's bed and infront of him is a fan so is it possible that Gyu experienced the same with Vernon and Cheollie.

~There was also a lit  lamp in Mingyu's room so I think he tries to fight his trauma by having a little hope.

~Seungcheol was obviously referring to the romance of the song to cover up their tracks. Seungcheol is seen in several shots looking at the light from the window. There is his light, his hope  and his way out but he is blinded and refuses to go. I DUNNO, MAN but I think this is Stockholm Syndrome.

~ Wonwoo, my poor baby. Whatever you do. i'll always be here for you. His references to depression breaks me. I have been there and it wasn't easy. So if y'all are having a bad time, i'll always be here for you ready to beat up a guy or two.

~Mirror room: reference to Claustrophobia but at the same time, it mirrors the boys and their own separate traumas. Making it seem unescapable.

CHANGE UP:

~ 10:10 references
~hints that SVT wants to lead the music industry in different countries
~SVT logo burning ~~~~ which one of you called Min Suga? 
~I have no theories for these because its a bop and this MV is basically SVT leaders saying they'll change up while still maintaining the SEVENTEEN style. (As shown with their table, its changing but the members don't)

@MegaYujing,"gosh I absolutely love this track 💕 I wonder if those of you that know Sung kyu's song in his '27' album, Alive, are like me and find that this song is very reminiscent of that track? The moment I heard that chord progression on the piano for this song my mind just flew to Alive. Both these songs are absolutely amazing, they hammer on my feels so much",0,2017-10-16T06:40:43Z

@czarahjadebazan8296,some of the basher commenters that I've read in some of seventeen video that seventeen group become hiatus if some of the members of seventeen would go to the military and will not be get popular like exo and bts.... but right now I observed what pledis did is a good job..... because if we analyzed what pledis did is to make super duper boyband not only as a 13 group to be recognized but also each unit group to become solid boyband in each unit that each unit would be recognized as boygroup so if time comes that few of the members would go to military the fans will not feel empty and the group will not go for hiatus because each unit has created solid impact for their fans and viewers and so this is a good job because you know I see a lot of kpop boyband that become hiatus and their popularity become decreased because some of fans leave them....,0,2017-10-16T06:35:11Z

Initially Pledis debuted them as self producing idols to save money, but now the members have that competing edge against other groups who have to wait for their company to come up with a good song and choreo. I hope their management really push Seventeen forward because they're really doing some solid things musically.",22,2017-10-16T05:35:00Z

After we got Change Up, Trauma and Lilili Yabay, our carat heart must be screaming like crazy..  So for the last vocal unit come to bless ur ears and soul ~ at first I thought the lyrics is abt something calm and comfort but then i read the translation its abt a sad feeling. I hope with this song, ppl will appreciate vocal unit more and realize tht their talent is beyond ur expectations ~ In seventeen overall, all of them are vocalist, dancers, rappers and visual ~ do not underestimate them cos they haven't show everything yet!  Please anticipate their next comeback on November 6 ~ sending love to the whole world ~

@reign252,"Now that this is out, I want to ask my fellow Carats a question.

I know that some of you are familiar with the account called “WONWOO JUSEYO” if you aren’t, then that account posts SEVENTEEN MVs after they’ve been posted on VLIVE. I think that that’s kind of wrong. That doesn’t help SEVENTEEN at all. That video is taking the views away from them. Sure, it may help Carats that don’t have access to VLIVE but real Carats can wait, it may actually increase the hype a bit. The only accounts that are allowed to post OFFICIAL MVs are SEVENTEEN and 1theK. Now, I want to know y'all's opinion on this. The account already deleted the video, but I’m almost 100% sure that they will post the comeback once it’s on VLIVE. That’s ruins everything. When BTS's DNA was leaked, there were a lot of angry ARMYs, that’s because the suspense was ruined. Their feelings, excitement, joy, pride, were toned down. Now it’s happening to Carats because of that one account. ARMYs are a big fandom, that’s why there are some immature ARMYs that ruin it for everyone else by leaking songs. Carats are getting bigger with every comeback, among those new fans are people who leak MVs before they’re supposed to be uploaded by OFFICIAL ACCOUNTS. When that one episode of GoT was leaked, people were mad, how is it any different with us?

TL;DR: “WONWOO JUSEYO” leaked this MV before it was uploaded by SEVENTEEN on YouTube. I was one of the commenters who told her to delete this and I was met with a lot of backlash. Video is deleted but she leaks every MV so she’s obviously going to do it again. 

Are we going to do something about this or not?

Edit: I’m so happy from all the support I’m getting and the support SEVENTEEN is getting because when I got a lot of hate on that video when I told them to delete it. I love this fandom because we support each other and we’re basically family.",108,2017-10-16T05:08:54Z

@christinegracehidalgobauti5687,"Jisoo's voice is like Jeonghan's but more refined. Jeonghan's is more angelic. DK's and Seungkwan's has a lot of similarities, but DK's can control more of his timbre, and seungkwan's alto is more refined and composed. Woozi's voice balanced everything on this song. He acts like the bass of the MV. Without him, the song will have an incomplete touch of harmony.

[도겸] 이런 저런 일들 숨 가쁘게 바쁜 이 뭣같은 세상 땜에 너와 내가 멀어진 거라 둘러대면

[도겸] 사람들은 다들 겉으로만 바람이 차지 않냐 물어봐 
그냥 그렇게 묻곤 지나가서 다 잊어버릴 거면서 왜 물어봐
[조슈아] 너에게서 부는 바람 같아서 그저 아무말 없이 기다릴 뿐인데

[도겸] 이 시간은 저편에 숨어버린 것만 같아 널 데리고
[승관] 이대로 널 볼 수 없을까 가끔은 안 좋은 생각도 들어 난 네 모습이 잊혀져만 가
[우지] 그래도 울지마 슬플 것 같지만 희미하게 남아 있는 너를 위해

@kristofferloistantano7801,"WOW. Okay that was just WOW. More than WOW, actually. 

I wanna write a letter for Carats, so I hope y'all meme experts take time and read this even if it might get long and emotional: 

I've said this before and I'll say it again, Seventeen never ever fails to impress. By just looking and listening at their new releases so far, from Change Up to this, they definitely deserve to be called as versatile artists. First they introduce us with Change Up through the leaders, and might I say it was a perfect introduction for what we Carats are really in for. For three weeks after that, they've been giving us masterpiece after masterpiece (and this does not even diminish how wonderful their previous releases are like daaaaayyuuummmm ""Well"" is still a personal fave). And what's great is that each song from each unit defines their group perfectly. Personal and emotional lyric-writing expressed in powerful raps and vocals? The Hiphop unit delivered! Complex yet more than pleasing choreography backed with a unique music, the Performance unit delivered! And now, a wonderful melody sang by five voices each having their own unique vocal color, the Vocal unit delivered! I'll say it all the time because I will never regret stanning Seventeen. We carats are so lucky to have them. As we all know they've been working nonstop. Other Pledis artists wore Hanboks for their Chuseok greetings, but they greeted in their prince costumes because they're still not done with the concert. I honestly didn't even think they'd have another comeback for this year. I thought the World Tour was their last major event for this year, but no, they'd release their second full-length album soon. They've been working really hard and as we'd seen their vlives, they never fail to mention how they are doing all this for us. I think Seventeen really wants to make Carats feel that this year is 20SVT. And this year isn't over yet, but I am more than satisfied already. I hope we all continue to support them and also, I love this fandom so much. Seventeen was the first Kpop group I seriously got in and poured my heart into to be part of it's fandom for a long time (right after Super Junior and wow that was a long time ago). I haven't been a carat for too long, only a little over a year, so I've never been there for them from the start, but wow I feel like I know every one of them now because they are all just so lovely. And I'm also very happy that the fandom I first truly belonged in was one that delights in peace, or at least tries to avoid extreme situations that are in no way beneficial to Seventeen at all. But despite all this, I know we are not a perfect fandom either. We get pressed, we get triggered too. But I really thank y'all because a fandom is really, really a big factor for me when stanning a group. And so far, I've been really contented with us. And I really really really hope that we could continue to be like this. Okay yes I might have said a lot. I'm sorry but y'all! Seventeen is pure talent! My wig has been snatched for the fourth time now! A proud fanboy has done talking. Thanks for your time! Have a good day.

Woozi has such a way to make songs so unique. Woozi deserves an award! His work and dedication is so admirable. Woozi of course always feels the burden but when he takes all that burden and combines it with the amount of wisdom in his mind... Guys its powerful. I instantly started crying when I heard him sing. He may be the shortest but he has so much strength, both physically and mentally. I only hope so much for him and his career. I can already imagine him walking away with a grammy. He is a bundle of pure talent. I hope he knows that. This masterpiece should be treasured. It comes from the hands of a true king.",48,2017-10-16T03:44:45Z

this song is delicately poised but it's so powerful at the the same time? i especially really really love the ""no matter how much time it takes, come back to me"" and that they would wait endlessly for it. quite akin to the hiphop unit's Trauma, this song feels like it's showcasing each member's different yet similar story. and vocal unit has succeeded in changing their concept every time, from 20 to 물래 듣지 마요, to 입버롯 to Pinwheel now. their songs are usually heartbreaking, but this felt like something else. it felt like nostalgia and hope. thank you seventeen, you never fail to amaze me.",0,2017-10-16T03:21:06Z

Most of them ended or started in black and white, so what if that was taken in the “past” point of view and Pinwheel takes place before the AL1 era? (It is 0.5 Chapter, after all). Perhaps Joshua was trying to reach out to Hoshi (but Jun heard his message instead), Woozi got lost, but still had Vernon’s compass, Mingyu’s piano is now Woozi’s (?), and when DK looks into the puddle, it connects to Joshua’s al1 teaser when he looks into the puddle too...When Seungkwan is in the car, what if he was trying to get to someone but got lost instead...Perhaps all of them were looking for one another (thus the running is present in both teasers and videos) But they had to go through struggles and different paths before finding each other?

I feel like there are so many different layers to this group to appreciate and they just prove it with each M/V they've put out over the past weeks. They're hard working boys who deserve appreciation for their works. Each unit. 

So many different aesthetics in 1 group. Idk how one can not stan. There's just about something for everyone.

@paopaomae,"Despite only getting into kpop this summer, I am so happy to have stanned SEVENTEEN as my first kpop group. The music and videos they put out are seriously masterpieces. The lyrics, composition, LITERALLY EVERYTHING...I am in love. I’ve been attached to western music for so long but kpop has given me a whole different perspective. Music truly breaks every boundary, even language. As the DWC era comes to a close, I hope that the new one will be full of energy and we carats will always support the boys!",53,2017-10-16T03:10:12Z

@hissoka,"Jeonghan has grown so much as a vocalist and my heart swells so much when he sings. I'm so proud of him. 

Joshua's voice is so refreshing and heart breaking at the same time. It's a talent to have emotion in your voice when singing and he has so much talent. 

Seungkwan's acting has improved too. His visuals are also out of this world.

Seokmin is so talented, I can't even. His voice, his visuals, his acting (Hoshi would be proud because DK is 10:10)

LEE JIHOON- the glue of our seventeen. I'm so proud of him. He has so much on his shoulders, but he never disappoints his members or his fans. This song is so well produced, composed and the music video itself is so amazing. I hope Jihoon looks back at his awards, his members and his fans and knows in his heart that this is all because of him. I'm so proud of him, and everyone in svt.",0,2017-10-16T03:07:00Z

@swaggiebaggieindahousetran406,"Theory 1.) Joshua is in the middle of the street, with a telephone. He leaves his last voicemail to jun “when we see eachother again.. oh nvm..” before he dies. Yes dies. Bc Seungkwan runs him over with a car. That’s why Seungkwan looks regretful in the MV. Seungkwan even walks backwards in the MV indicating that he wants to rewind his mistakes? Theory 2.) this is just logic. Joshua’s phone is unplugged so it doesn’t work. He calls hosh but like in hoshi’s teaser, the younger doesn’t hear anything, bc Joshua’s phone never worked in the first place. But he picked up bc he sensed something?
