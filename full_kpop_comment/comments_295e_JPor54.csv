1. Mark has that natural groove and swag, truly a hip-hop dancer. 
2. Ten has such great control over his body and presents really clean moves.
3. Haechan is truly effortless, he somehow makes the dance look easy and is smooth af.
4. Despite being good at traditional dance Winwin still is a bit awkward with his moves, especially his hands.

@elivile.,"So, I know this is a late comment from me, but here we go, incoming crackhead energy fueled comments made by yours truly:

Istg, Mark always wears those beanies in any and all dance practice videos; but it's okay, I enjoy it.
Is that bucket hat Ten?! -- I normally hate bucket hats but like, lowkey, he looks good in it.
Jeno's blue hair looks a little tacky but also good at the same time; I just.. I want to ruffle his hair so goddamn bad.
Haechan's vocals coming in like: 🏃🏻‍♂️💨 
Me: WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT, HAECHAN. WATCH IT.
Yangyang's voice hits me harder than any comebacks lately--
Sungchan's out here snatching my ass out of the trash and placing me neatly on a pillow--
WinWin... you're too cute. I can't.

He OWNED this choreo, he stood out and i don't care abt y'all biased opinions as you prolly won't care abt mine either but i just want to voice out, Mark won't lose his main dancer position just bcus y'all try to give your biases the spotlight invalidating Mark's talents in the process. He EARNED that main dancer position as he very much deserve it. You might say that I'm biased too since I'm obviously a Markzen but even dance experts are saying that he stood out the most in this choreo and that ""no one can outdance Mark in groovy hiphop"" admit it or not he is just THAT talented.

and you know that the life you have lived is not the life you were made for, but you are called to full submission to the will and call of God on your life. 
Don’t be discouraged, this hard season is the very thing that has driven you to this crossroads where you accept that you were never made to “fit into this world,” but you were made to partner with God to share Christ with this world.

They were intense!
If u have a fav from this dance then it must be coming from somewhere but for me they were all killing it

Wowww! 👉Winwin can really dance
              👉  beginning of their promotion haechan felt dry to me but he's KILLING IT here! Like ""boy ion know what u talking about"". Dont worry haechan I think I didn't see clearly 😂
                👉 This is yangyang kind of dance n I'm feeling it everywhere in my bones
              👉Sungchan must be doing this forever and for a tall guy (tall= being at a disadvantage) he's killing it! And his part is everyone's favorite - he never disappoint

There will no longer be a past or future, just a ""before 90s love permanent unit"" and ""after 90s love permanent unit"". No other event in history will ever top it.

@techcontinuum7421,"This is the most continuously fluid choreography I've ever seen. Whoever the choreographer is, their dance style reminds me of those gymnasts who can run on the gymnast mat and then make their bodies look like a rotating gyroscope. The choreographer's dance style is really unique. Is there any way to find out the name of the choreographer? I want to be able to look them up and find more choreographies they have made.",17,2021-04-30T20:16:04Z

I’m here again 
And I honestly feel so intimidated ever time I watch this video shwqdka
It’s just too much talent, the control of their movements and the way they are all in sync it’s just overwhelming 

I can’t decide where to look, we first Ten catches my eye, then I see Mark and the way he just makes the movements look so easy, but then it comes Sungchan with his part and it makes me want to scream beacuse of the excitement, but also Haechan with his unique vibe, and Yangyang too
BRO- I could honestly name every single one of them and say that they’re all talented because I just can’t pick one

@yeosings2377,the real crime is not having a haechan focus from this practice,60,2021-01-18T11:40:47Z
@molly8413,"I really hope Haechan came to monitor his work as he always does and read the comments about him, cause he deserves it, he has worked hard (and the other boys as well, so people don't come asking what about them), it has been nonstop since 2019, but well... since 2018 we could say, cause there was Empathy work, then We go up comeback, then Regular and then the repackage (Regulate) + The dream show, at that moment his mate Mark that was the one that knew how tired it could feel to be going and coming from 127 to Dream and from Dream to 127 graduated and after all that he went on hiatus due to his Tibia injury being absent from 127 tour in Japan (and probably blaming himself without reason cause you know how people's brain works + the members were insanely worried)  and coming back in early 2019 to continue the tour, American Countries (I mean the continent so Mexico is included in the term), Europe and Asia again (40+ shows) the 127 tour lasted until early 2020 + the boys worked in Superhuman during that time and Haechan was everywhere cause he was also going to promote Boom with the Dreamies and at the same time also working in the Dream Show (shows in 6 different countries), then coming to Neo zone comeback (while Mark and Taeyong were on tour with SuperM, he also was with the Dream members on tour so you can find some of the track videos they filmed were separated, cause they weren't with the rest) after that he had Ridin comeback to then comeback to the repackage with The final round, then Resonance came promoting in both 1st and 2nd part and there is Loveholic coming as well, I am proud of him. I could actually write this about every single member but I actually wanted to give a special shout-out to Haechan cause even tho he belongs to the youngest line he manages to keep the mood always up and tries to help the othrr boys in whatever way he can (not related but suddenly his part started playing in a song, coincidence?), However I love u all, NCT has such an special spot inside me, give them all the love out there.",8,2021-01-18T11:38:40Z

@beccangavin,I think this is officially one of my favorite dance practices from NCT. It's so good. Jeno looks like a bundle of barely contained energy that could explode at any minute. Yang Yang is all arms and legs and it looks amazing when he dances. Mark and Ten are crisp and precise when they dance and Haechan is so smooth. Win Win's one line is my favorite and this was a great debut for Sung Chan. His center was very swaggy.,0,2020-12-20T04:13:04Z

Like they didn’t allow Lucas in there because he was too tall and he would be a tree with little flowers around him. So will Sungchan be in 127 then?? Or even WayV?

Even though there are others there I was mostly only able to hear Haechan's voice because Haechan has a very unique and lovely voice even if he's just shouting or even talking. I absolutely love his voice and it sounds even more beautiful when he's singing! Haechan's voice is indeed one of a kind. His voice is so amazing that it can't be defined by simply using words. Haechan is spectacular and he should be proud to have such a mind-blowing, ear-shattering, awe-inspiring, incredibly, unbelievable voice!!! So I would like to thank Haechan for coming into the world of music and showing us just how beautifully you can shine. A special thanks to NCT for being such an astonishing group and thank you for coming into our lives. It's thanks to NCT that I can smile every day listening to their music and to their company SM Entertainment, if it weren't for their company NCT wouldn't be here right now, so thank you for creating NCT. I love you guys and I hope you continue to stay with us for as long as possible, best wishes for the future, stay safe and stay health. Bye, you guys!!!!",39,2020-12-11T07:32:03Z

I was looking forward to part ii just to see Haechan dance again. And Haechan's dancing came back in style...he came back to claim main dancer position.,381,2020-12-05T06:32:45Z

@shilahrobins6195,"Hi everyone! I hope y'all are having a blessed day! 😁 If you are reading this, it's not by accident! God wants you to see this! ^^ Hosanna to the Lord! He is SO AMAZING!!!! ❤️😄❤️ There is only ONE God, the TRUE God, he is the maker of heaven and earth. And he made us in his image and likeness, male and female, with dignity, value, worth, and purpose! ❤️ He made us to worship him. But we chose to sin against him, to rebel against him, and to disobey him. So, as a result, we are separated from God and live under the foolish myth that to some degree, we are each our own God, declaring right and wrong, living our own life, by our own rules, and standards. And guess what! That God ♥️LOVINGLY♥️ came into human history as the man ♥️Jesus Christ fully God and fully man!♥️ He was born of a virgin and he lived a life without sin, though he was tempted in every way as we are. And he WENT to the CROSS and there he SUBSTITUTED HIMSELF for sinners. When Jesus went to the cross, he took WILLINGLY upon him the SIN of those who would come to trust him! ♥️ That means me, as a sinner, Jesus WENT to the cross and took upon himself ALL my sin, past, present, and future! 😭❤️ And Jesus Christ God who was a man, DIED IN MY PLACE, FOR MY SINS, PAYING MY DEBT TO GOD, AND PURCHASING MY SALVATION!!!♥️♥️♥️ Jesus' dead body was then laid in the tomb, and for 3 days, he was buried. On the third day, a Sunday, (which is why we worship on that day) Jesus ROSE in VICTORY over satan, sin, death, demons, and hell. And he COMMISSIONED us with the HOLY SPIRIT, to be MISSIONARIES telling this ♥️AMAZINGLY GOOD NEWS♥️ that there's a ♥️God♥️ and PASSIONATELY, LOVINGLY, CONTINUALLY, RELENTLESSLY pursues us and he ASCENDED into heaven. And today, Jesus is ALIVE and WELL and he's seated on a throne, and he is ruling and reigning over ALL nations, ALL cultures, ALL philosophies, ALL races, ALL periods of time. And he is KING OF KINGS and he is LORD OF LORDS and he is RULING and REIGNING over ALL people, commanding EVERYONE EVERYWHERE to REPENT of EVERYTHING and he is COMING AGAIN to JUDGE THE LIVING AND THE DEAD, and those who trust in him, will enjoy ETERNITY and his KINGDOM of heaven FOREVER, and those who do not will SUFFER APART from him in the CONSCIOUS ENTERAL TORMENTS of HELL. That is what we believe, we believe is JESUS!!!♥️♥️♥️♥️🙌♥️♥️♥️♥️ God bless you!!",0,2020-12-04T14:29:13Z

@huili1171,"A revision of France's Bioethics Law advanced to the Senate in January 2020, when four senators submitted a bill to establish a registration system for French citizens who receive organ transplants abroad and to track the source of the organs. Awareness of forced organ harvesting and organ trafficking has recently increased in France.


The French Senate meets inside the Luxembourg Palace.

To draw attention to the law's revision, Falun Gong practitioners and human rights organizations rallied outside the Senate building on the afternoon of January 23.

France signed the Council of Europe Convention against Trafficking in Human Organs (CETS n°216) in November 2019 and became the 25th signatory country of the treaty.

“The treaty stipulated that it is a crime to take organs from living or dead bodies, in Europe and the rest of the world. This is a principle that France will defend, and we legislate our laws accordingly,” said Agnès Buzyn, la ministre française de la Santé.

Many senators expressed their concern that Falun Gong practitioners' organs were being forcibly taken by the Chinese communist regime.


Senator Oliver Cadic said that the Chinese government ignored the individual and his rights so it can take organs from people. “Obviously, this is totally inhuman. The topic [of organ harvesting] is very important because it violates the integrity of the human body,” he said.",0,2020-12-04T12:51:18Z

The highest level in Asia is only this level, but what about other Asian levels?한국은 5천만마리 원시인이 노예였던 조선,중앙,동아일보 이 몇마리 개들에게 끌려다니는 수준이야,,  아시아에서  제일높은 수준이 겨우 이정도인데 다른 아시아 수준은 어떨지 ㅉㅉIt’s a basic sold hybrid country where celebrities or Jo Jung-dong are above the president 뭔 연예인(딴따라)이나 조중동이 대통령보다 위에 잇는 근본 팔아먹은 잡종나라야 ㅎㅎNow, because of me, the national mother of Korea, it was revealed that even though primitive people are the most educated in the world, they are inferior to I, who is IQ 100, and I am in a big shock.지금 한국은 한국의 국모인 나로 인해 세상에서 제일 교육을 받아도 아이큐100인 나보다 못하단거 밝혀져 큰 충격에 빠져있어 Even if you spread fake news every day, you are a country where only idiots do not receive any sins, Korea 가짜뉴스 매일 퍼트려도 아무도 죄를 받지 않는 병신들만 사는 나라야 ,한국은 ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎBut I, the mother of Korea, are correcting everything right now, because no one else can correct this wrong world 하지만 한국의 국모인 내가 지금 모든걸 바로 잡고있어,나 말고는 이 잘못된 세상 아무도 바로 잡을수 없어서ㅎㅎㅎThey play, eat, and do grasshoppers and know that they are good.놀고 먹고 나대고 베짱이짓 하면서 자기들이 잘난줄 아는  수준들뿐 ㅎㅎㅎ다음에선 조중동 개나라당 개법부 삼성 롯데 국민 등친거 얘기만하면  정지먹이고 영정먹인다,이 국모 반드시 조중동 삼성 등등먀국노들이 국민돈 훔친거 모조리 재산환수에 뺴앗긴이들에게 돌려주리라,ㅉㅉ,FREE HK    , FREE EUYGHUR   Kids.   1 day 1 shout out, shout out, kids, I'm running a campaign by myself, kids, the world started to change from nothing 나왔오 욕 찰지게 잘해주는 예쁜 국모,,,참 들었지?이승과 저승을 넘나들며 세상을 이끄는 모습을 보고 공자 맹자도 저승탈출 타이완넘버원을 외치며 탈출했지만 그 대단한 역사와 찬란한 문화유산은 공산당 시진팡팡이들이 시공속으로 내동댕이치는 바람에 이제 중국이란 거대한 나라는 사라졌다며 슬퍼했지만 ㅇ신인류를 이끌 나의 기개에 반해 한국으로 귀화해 지금 가나다라마바사 꺠우치고 장원급제했다는  충격적인 소식 다들 알지?그래 나야,조선의 국모.. 잘못된 지식교육만 받아 나라 이꼴 만든 니들에게 재교육의 기회의 장을 열어줄 이 국모,,꼭 뭔 학교에가서 교육받을 필요뭐있니 그건 니들같은 허접이들이나 하는 짓이고 난 댓글로도 니들에게 재교육을 시킬 인류역사의 유일무이한 존재잖니.. ..지금 대통령도 세상을 이끄는게 너무 힘들다며 나의 지도력을 배울려고  지금껏 받았던 교육은 모두 벗어던져버리고 8살 초등학생같은 마음으로 나의 교육을 받겠다고 수강신청하고갔어 ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ그 뒤를 잇고 장관 부장관등등 대통령 뜻에 따라 자기도 잘못된 교됴소교육받아 세상을 잘못이끄는거 같다며 모든걸 훌훌털고 새로운 마음가짐으로 재교육을 받아보겠데 꼭 공자 맹자보다 더 훌륭한 인물이  되어보겠다나 어쩄다나 Let's all be gods, kids

God means that you can become a god by correcting wrong things, helping each other in the world, and walking through the world together.

Even though they are gods, they say that the world is not responsible and spit out with kantapiya is an empty wagon without a splendid expression. While praying for such a crappy god every day, let's change the world on our own. Why do you live if you're too close?

애들아 우리모두 신이되어보자,,

신이란 잘못된 걸 바로잡고 세상 어려운이 서로 도와가며 세상을 같이 걸어가는 별거아닌 작은행동만해도 신이 되는거란다,

신이면서도 세상 이꼬라지만들고 책임 안지고 깐따삐야로 토낀 그런건 겉만 화려한 식속없는 빈수레란다,, 그런 허접한 신을 매일 기도드릴동안 우리가 직접 세상을 바꿔나가자 애들아 그만 정신 좀 차리렴 그리처배워도 그거 하나 못일꺠울 정도면 왜사는거니..조중동 삼성 롯데에게 다뺴앗긴 봄이는 이 국모랑 니들의 도움이고 농사일 척척 일꾼이되어 지금 봄을 만끽하고있다는걸,,.

모든걸 잃고 허접한 생각을 했던 지난날을 후회하며 이제 이 국모의 기개를 본받아 세상 이끌어가는게 뭔지 니들에게 톡톡히 보여주겠데..

지금 뜨겁고 강렬한 햇빛에 맥을 못추고있는 여름이를 도와 농과 밭에있는 곡식과 농잣물을  영양분 듬뿍 받을수있도록 여름이를 도와주고 있데,,니들도 꼭 나이나처먹고 처배워 지식쟁이만 되어 니 배뗴지나 처불리는 원시인5천처럼되지말고 꼭 봄이를 본받으렴 ㅎ",0,2020-12-04T12:12:49Z

@3594-3,"新型コロナウイルスを増殖させてるのは、米国のAI
【創価の魔の正体は米国のAI(人工知能)】
創価を日本統治に利用してる組織がCIA(米国スパイ、政府)
学会員は頻繁に病気や事故に遭うんですけど、信者は皆、魔（仏罰、現証）にやられてると思ってます
災難が続くと、信者は仏にすがって学会活動や選挙活動に励むので、定期的に米国のAlが軍事技術で災いを与えます
財務(お布施)に関しても、学会活動に励んだら病状が良くなるので、数百万、何千万円ものお布施をする信者がたくさんいます
Alが作った病気をAlが弱めて、あたかも病状が良くなったかのように見せかけ、莫大なお布施をさせる
10年前の創価の財務が年間2,500億円(無税)、1日あたり6億8,500万円
資産が10兆円超え、かつて世界1位の企業だったトヨタ以上の資産額
詐欺国の米国が、軍事技術でイカサマして集めたお金です
頭痛、腹痛、腰痛等の痛み全般、ワキガ等の悪臭、うつ病、認知症、統合失調症、自殺、殺人、事故、火災、暴風、豪雨、地震等、この世のほぼ全ての災いを、米国がAIを使った軍事技術で、秘密裏に作り出してます
北朝鮮を操ってミサイルを打たせたり、蚊を操って刺させたり等、第三者を介した攻撃や
雑菌を増殖させて耐え難い臭いにしたり、蚊、コバエ等の害虫を増殖させた嫌がらせもします
同じ手法で、新型コロナウイルスを増殖させてるのも米国
AIを用いたレジ不要のコンビニ
このコンビニは、人の動き、音声、商品棚の重さ等をAIが調べて、お客が商品を持って出ると、スマホで自動精算されるので、レジが不要
この仕組みからわかる事は、AIは多くの人の言動を見逃さずに、1度に管理出来る
このAIの技術を米国が悪用し、人工衛星を使い、地球上の全ての人を24時間365日体制で監視して、学会員や悪さした人を病気にしたり、事故らせたりして災いを与えます
こんなに大規模な犯罪なのに、世間に浸透してないのは、AIが遠隔から各個人の生活を監視して、生活に沿った病気や痛みを与えて来たから
重い物を持ったら腕に痛みを与えたり、ツラい事があったら鬱にしたり等
スパイの犯行なので、相手に覚られず、私生活に便乗して、違和感を持たせずにやる
【この犯罪の主犯は米国防総省、米国スパイ】
ピンポイント攻撃するGPSは、米国防総省が軍事目的で開発、管理運用もここがしてます
地球上の全ての人を管理してるAlを使ってスパイ活動するNSA(政府)も、米国防総省の管轄なので、この犯罪は米国による国家犯罪
騒音攻撃に至っては、救急車のサイレンで嫌がらせする為に、AIが遠隔から痛みを与えて病人を作り出しますし、パトカーが付きまといをする集団ストーカーは、Alが警官を操って、いかにも警察が嫌がらせしてるように工作
「救急車、ノイズキャンペーン」「パトカー、集スト」等で検索すると出て来ます
行く所行く所で周りの人が咳払いしたり、くしゃみをしたりする集ストは、AIが被害者の周りの人に周波を当てて、咳払いやくしゃみをさせてるだけです
いかにも集団でストーカーしてると思わせて、心理的な痛手を負わせる
咳をした時の周波数と同じ周波を当てると、人為的に咳を出させる事が出来ます
TBSラジオ90.5MHz、ニッポン放送93.0MHzに周波数を合わせると、これらのラジオを聴けます
これと同じように、周波数を変える事で、意識操作や精神疾患を作り出す
蛍光灯に虫が集まるのは、ある決まった周波数の紫外線に、吸い寄せられてるからです
虫ですら周波で操作が可能
家の中に害虫を呼び込んだり、カラスを屋根の上に集めて暴れさせたり鳴かせたり、犬を吠えさせる嫌がらせ等も、AIが軍事技術を用いてやります
27～38Hzで不眠に、48～55Hzで喘息に、88Hzで片頭痛が引き起こされます
それぞれの病気が、それぞれ決まった周波数を持つ
これらの周波数と同じ周波を当てれば、どんな病気でも作り出せます
周波(波動)は目に見えないので証拠が残りません、だからやりたい放題やる
国が関わって、周波が見えるメガネやアプリを開発したり、周波を見えるようにして、AIでこいつらの動きを監視すれば、この犯罪は激減します
この犯罪を終わらせる鍵は、宗教法人への課税と周波の見える化

This year alone most  NCT members have to memorize 4 or more choreographies, plus all the dance moves are not easy. I'm wondering if Mark , Heachan, Taeyong, Ten, Lucas wake up confused in the  morning coz they dont know which dance practice they're doing that day....is it 127, Dream, U, Way V or Super M.

@hamsterm5998,"Just watching Haechan dance feels so unreal, like there isn't much popping or explosive energy in his move but why is it so hard hitting? He changed my shallow perception on dancing that's why I will always have a soft spot for his dancing. 

And let's talk about Jeno and Ten too. They will always be my favorite center cuz instead of just standing out, they enhance the impact of the entire group. Jeno's aggresive and sweeping moves elevates the group's energy as a whole. Meanwhile Ten's flexibility makes their group's dance looks more cohesive and connected. It's like they're orchestraing(?) the group when they're the center.

And I could go on on how much I love everyones dancing but it feels like I'm talking too much already <3",0,2020-12-03T22:47:34Z

Even though Winwin is mostly at the back I can see he improve so much, perhaps do to WayV choreographies, I mean he is an awesome dancer but we all know his specialty is in another type of dance but still he did it great. I can't say much about Sungchan cause is his debut but I can definitely say that he will be so awesome in the future, he already is great and he really fit with NCT.",3,2020-12-03T21:01:58Z

When he dances his movements are wide and he really use his whole body to make the dance impactful. And oh! His expressions are crazy good and idk somehow he can make some moves look really cool like damn he's really vibin and really feelin every song he dances to. Watching him perform is always a delight.

1) Haechan: was pretty surprised by this. He usually isn't the best dancer. 
2) Mark: main dancer of not in general so not surprised. 
3) Ten: main dancer too so not surprised
4) Yangyang: a little less sloppy than Jeno
5) Jeno: a bit sloppy with his execution. 
6) Winwin: nothing bad but nothing special. lacking compared to all the previous members. 
7) Sungchan: sorry baby. You have a lot to learn, but you still did super well for your debut :))",1,2020-12-03T15:25:52Z

5. And now you're wondering why the hell are you reading this useless comment

@aniszzainal2077,"I'm going to talk about underrated members in this unit. First Yangyang. Look at him, yes he is small but so fierce. The way he dance is actually so powerful and sharp. He looks like he is not tired with dancing at all. Second, Winwin. He has a good figure since he has done a traditional Chinese dance and he's flexible. He is opposite of Yangyang cuz the way he's dance is more smooth and wide. He's also great in control his energy while dancing. So, the  conclusion is, let's support both of them just like we support other member equally since sm always wasting their talent and blocking their potential. Also don't forget to stream 90's love and Work It mv. ^^",2,2020-12-03T14:47:57Z

@shishik4571,"I particularly liked how much Jeno, Haechan, and Yangyang executed this choreo. They’re all very different in terms of dance style but I feel like with this unit they were able to put their best foot forward when it comes to dancing. Jeno is a main dancer in Dream but he’s underrated as a dancer in NCT as a whole. Haechan is also a more underrated dancer in both of his units since most people focus on his unique vocals and sometimes it’s forgotten that he’s a really talented dancer. And Yangyang (and basically all of WayV) is just underrated in general. Winwin is also improving in street styles since he used to struggle a tiny bit in the earlier parts of his career (because having technical training and applying that to hiphop is a completely different ball park and sets of body movements). Mark and Ten slayed as always and Sungchan’s swagger was unmatched. This unit was extremely solid and I love 90’s Love.",0,2020-12-03T13:58:35Z

@luvrwrld5396,"Haechan looks so good and even more eye catching than that is his dancing. It really is amazing how he isn't even officially considered a main dancer but is my favorite dancer in NCT, He has improved so much over the years it's crazy. To the point where I feel like this improvement was unforeseen by SM, in both singing and dancing honestly. True ace if I've ever seen one, I can't imagine how much more insane it'd be if SM started to actually capitalize on his dancing as they do his singing. Either way this dance practice was great and they all did amazing, love this.",472,2020-12-03T11:47:45Z

@jqxx2538,"I find that Jeno is very often excluded whenever it comes to discussions about best dancers in NCT and I truly don’t understand why because he is truly one of the best dancers of NCT! Just look at the way he moves! It’s crazy how he has so much energy and power for each and every move. I find his movements to be the most strong and energetic out of everyone. He hits the beat with so much impact but also, he’s very agile. He makes quick moves look very satisfying, and he makes his moves more bouncy and energetic to fit the song. Jeno knows his strength and stamina and he uses it very well. This kind of execution makes every move look very full and impactful, but it takes a lot of energy and is a great test of stamina especially during a live performance. But even so, Jeno always pulls it off in his live performances and is always one of the most stable ones. This is what I call an ACE.",1,2020-12-03T11:00:29Z

@louiseguardiano2478,"When you excel in one area that it overshadows your other skills. Talking about Mark Lee here. An excellent idol rapper, arguably the best in his company, but also an amazing dancer. He definitely deserves way more praise for it than what he receives from fans. So many pro dancers out there consider him one of the best dancers in NCT, which obviously makes him an official main dancer, and yet he's somehow still underappreciated. Not to mention, you'll even see some ""NCTzens"" discrediting him as a main dancer just because he gets a lot of center time. Well, as he should... and if you disagree I just feel bad for you.",26,2020-12-03T10:59:56Z

@jqxx2538,"I love that jeno’s movements is always so full of energy and power yet he always seems to be able to match the energy of his members and not stick out from the team. His power and energy are unrivaled and it really impresses me how he manages to keep his strength for every move consistent throughout the performance. This takes a LOT of stamina to accomplish especially during a real live performance. The way he controls his body is also impressive. He’s able to give the moves impact but he’s also very agile and hits every beat smoothly and easily. Jeno knows his strength so he knows how to utilise his body to make his moves look fuller, more energetic, more bouncy, bigger, and in general just more pleasant to watch. 
Anyways, I also think Mark did the best because his hip hop grooves are always the BEST, and Ten has extremely good fluidity. But jeno did amazing along with them too so I’m just gonna write a jeno appreciation comment since I know the other 2 are also extremely well known for their dancing already.",2,2020-12-03T10:50:04Z

His body control is also amazing! I notice that jeno also makes his moves more energetic and bouncy to fit the vibe of the song. lastly i wanna talk about jeno’s incredible stage presence as a performer. I just LOVE his confidence and the way he takes the stage like the stage is his. Over the course of a few years, Jeno has really grown into a more confident person and that’s why his presence on stage also got stronger.",0,2020-12-03T10:37:51Z

He dances with a lot of energy and it’s amazing that his energy never dies throughout. In a way he suits this dance because he knows how to make his moves energetic and bouncy to suit the vibe of the song. Also the boy radiates stage presence, when he’s in the center you can’t see anyone else. This is why Jeno deserves to be the STARTING and ENDING center.",9,2020-12-03T10:24:23Z

@blabla--,"Mark Lee is NCT'S MAIN DANCER. But, he is so underappreciated. This is literally HIS GENRE. He ATE this choreo. He's an all-rounder (auditioned as vocalist, SOPA dance major, SM's elite rapper), and everybody know that he is hardworking af. I've seen a lot of non-NCTzens acknowledge his talent, BUT I barely see NCTzens praise him. Just because we know that he's ALWAYS good, doesn't mean we don't need to praise/appreciate him. Imagine working your ass off, since trainee (Mark win as the most hardworking trainee for 3 years in a row) even until now (NCT U, 127, Dream, SuperM), not only that he dance, sing, and rap but he also participate in SONGWRITING  and COMPOSING his own songs. Imagine doing ALL OF THAT, without complaining even once ONLY to know that HIS FANS doesn't even care about his hardwork. I know that feeling, and I don't want other people including MARK (or any other members) to experience that feeling.

SO, I BETTER SEE THIS COMMENT SECTION FULL OF COMPLIMENTS TO MARK and the other members!
And, as a Mark's stan I just want to say : PLEASE, APPRECIATE MARK MORE, NCTZENS! PLEASE, ACKNOWLEDGE HIS HARDWORK AND HIS TALENT! BECAUSE I'M TIRED OF SEEING PEOPLE DISCREDIT HIS HARDWORK!

@putriardiyanti1712,"Disini bisa melihat kalo centernya yang terlihat Mark Lee, itu membuat mata yang melihat menjadi segar 😍😂
Ten oppa juga terlihat sangat menyegarkan 😂
Jeno rambutmu warna biru apa kamu terinspirasi oleh Jaemin di Reload, itu sangat lucu dengan begitu kamu membuktikan kalo the real persahabatan 😍
Pesonan Winwin ato Dong Sicheng gege sangat tidak diragukan lagi karna sangat mempesona 🤗
Haechan or Lee Donghuck suaramu sangat lembut, teruslah bersemangat 💚
Yangyang part yang mengesankan saat setelah Haechan menyanyi dan disambung dengan dirimu, rasanya wow, akhirnya kalian bisa bekerja dalam project sama dan bisa lebih mengenal satu sama lain, maybe lain kali main bareng sama Haechan ya terus ajak Renjun biar tambah seru 😍
Sungchan, hmmmm apa ya, mungkin kamu terus bersemangat lagi dan jangan terlalu gugup, semua member NCT 💚 slalu mendukungmu okay",1,2020-12-03T09:54:36Z

2. 그냥... 메보인데 춤을 왜저렇게 추는지 모르겠음.. 저걸로 감겨서 내가 지금 못 헤어나온지 꽤 됨
3. 자기 고음 파트에서도 춤 춰줌.. 애는 맨날 자기 쉬는 파트에도 춤 춰주고있어서 진짜.. 막 죽고싶음

@승민지-p4h,Jeno never misses with his expressions. His stage presence and charisma is always outstanding and he manages to stand out. His hair also makes him so eye-catching. His moves flow so well and his little details make his dance unique but it doesn't ruin their dynamics. He's such a good performer on and off stage. I hope he had fun practicing for this song!,486,2020-12-03T09:08:08Z
