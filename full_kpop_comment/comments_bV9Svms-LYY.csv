Please reply to this comment with your song choice if you would like to participate. I will randomly draw a name out of a hat. If it’s yours, we will go to your choice next!

@h-playwithmyhart.4806,"Jeon Jungkook. I want to start by talking about your musicality in this sense, more specifically, your voice. You have the most healing, soothing, calming, and passionate voice I have heard in my life.  You have such a breathy, gorgeous vocal tone that ignites every single word that you sing.  It is one action to speak, but sometimes what you sing says more to us than what mere words could ever. Your voice is as gentle and comforting as a lullaby, but as powerful and soulful as a person’s spirit. You can bring tears to those who aren’t sensitive, and put a spring in the step of those who feel lifeless. You’re the only person who I know encompasses so much talent and possibility in one voice. You tell stories, give advice, and release pain just by singing for us. Just as your singing serves as an entire mind and body experience for the listener, your dancing is equally as imperative as a component for your exquisite performances. You have all of the skills and marks of a phenomenal dancer, but when you dance your body absorbs the music. Your body moves and becomes one with the rhythm, and watching you fall into the music to let yourself go makes us feel liberated. Whether it be contemporary, hip-hop, or any other style, your body naturally adapts to the atmosphere and every little morsel of composition. Only you have the blood in your veins that pumps through it the essence of dance; of which no amount of training or practice could be put in to acquire. Needless to say, you have reached new heights in the world as well as within yourself musically. You’ve quite clearly taken the globe by storm as you have emerged as one of the most iconic artists in this generation; and furthermore, in this world. You’ve revolutionized the sound and meaning of music; as well as performance etiquette. There will literally never be another artist to grace this Earth like you again, so we will live through and spread the history that you have made with each passing day. Thank you for your legacy in music and for discovering more about it each time you associate with it. As much as I love your musicality, I love your personality all the same. After years of being in this line of work, you’ve only matured, but never lost who you are at your core. You are astonishingly humble and I always marvel at this especially given how admirable of a person that you are. Most importantly, you are the greatest friend a person could ask for and I know that your members love this about you more than anybody else. You are so intriguing in that your members have always wanted to protect you, yet they want to learn from you and look up to you all the same. The past several years of knowing them, no doubt have been the greatest and you are at the heart of the memories that make them who they are. You give them youth, energy, strength, determination, and belief in themselves.  Where the other boys may see insecurities and imperfections in themselves, all you have ever seen is beauty and perfection. They wouldn’t know their worth if you hadn’t spent the past years of their lives raising them and instilling in them the values to live a satisfied and rewarding life. Army just want to thank you for filling every single second of your members’ lives since you’ve met with the greatest memories and stories worth telling. Thank you for helping them grow and evolve, all while ensuring that they listen to their heart. Thank for changing their lives forever, and becoming a brother that will remain a part of their soul even in death. I want to personally thank your family and parents for raising you and helping you to become the irreplaceable light that you represent in this world. I have no doubt that you family is one of your biggest, if not the one reason that you are able to be where you are today. I know that they helped you and allowed you to reach your dream. I’ve heard you thank them and consider them so many times along your journey and I know that you keep them with you everywhere that you go. You will get lost and might feel like you can’t ever find your way back, but your family will always be your guidance. There is no situation too severe that they could not save you from and help you through. They support you more than anybody else in this world. You honor them will all that you do and attest to the way they raise you with the life you lead. Don’t ever think you disappoint them because you are their greatest love and dream in this life. They will always love you and be proud of you more than anybody else in this world. As ARMY, we keep them in our hearts as you do and strive to be as gentle and impactful to others as they are. Jungkook, I was unaware of the depth that could exist in a relationship between fans and idols until you came into my life. So much has changed in your life since you started, and I realize that one of the constants that has never changed, only gotten stronger, is ARMY and our love for you. You don’t let your walls come down entirely until you are with us or your members, and we get to see you as realistically as possible without meeting you in person. We live our day to day lives working hard because we know that you are somewhere several miles away doing the same for us. We’ve seen you go through a lot and though it is unbearable to see you down at all, we are so lucky that you trust us enough to see you in these conditions. You work so hard for us; pushing your body and mind past its limit just to make us happy and we don’t deserve you straining yourself for just one performance. Not to make you feel overwhelmed, but you have literally saved the lives of hundreds, maybe even thousands of ARMY who have wanted to give up on themselves. You give us all the strength, love, and faith that we need to live the best life, even if it means giving some of your own basic needs to us. I want to thank you for making our lives so worthy and making us individually feel like we are on top of the world. No matter when they meet you, it feels like they’ve had years of the greatest and most emotional memories that will be treasured and honored in the most sensitive part of our hearts. Thank you for helping the millions of ARMY fulfill their destiny in life and for giving them a place of bliss to return to that lies within you.  We could never forget that the best years of our lives will be defined by you. I know that you’ve been through a lot, both personally and professionally. We’ve been trusted enough to see some of what you gone through, whether it be physically, mentally, or in any other way. Like aforementioned, even if you are in the slightest bit unhappy, it is unbearable and overwhelming to see.  We’ve already seen too much, but it breaks our hearts to know that we might not even know the half of it. You’ve been working for so long, and essentially gave up your youth for all of us. I can’t imagine how hard it might have been on you at times. Given this, all I can say on behalf of all of your loved ones is that we are so beyond proud of you for making it past all of your struggles. I know that you’ve found true happiness and have felt alive doing what you do, and we are just so thankful that you are able to overcome what ails you. When the time comes, you are able to remain optimistic and turn your pain into productivity.  Every time, you come out on the other side so much more mature and experienced. We all look up to you in this sense because you see every difficult moment as a time to learn and grow. We learn from you in this way, and we know that no matter what you face in the future, you will be able to face it with confidence. I hope that this birthday makes all of your dreams come true, and that you get accomplish all that you desire to today.  I hope that your ARMY serve as a vacation for you today and allow you to just breathe in the life that surrounds you. I hope you are able to look at us, see the people we’ve become, and recognize all of the countless hearts you’ve mended. I hope you can take this day to see all that you have done for this world in over eight years. I wish that those around you also help you to realize what a cherished spirit and soul that you are. I hope you get to relax today, and that this goes down as one of the best days you've ever had! Those who love you most will help you make only the best memories that you can always look back on! You deserve all of the blessings, success, and happiness that you have; and I know that there’s only more to come! Please have fun and spend every second doing what you love! Thank you so much for sacrificing so much just to make BTS and so many of your solo projects possible. Thank you for suffering through any pain, fatigue, doubt, confusion, isolation, concern, hardship, loneliness, and so much more just to bring us the slightest bit of content at all.  Of course I want you to work until you are satisfied with yourself, but I don’t want you to stress because you want it to be perfect for us. You are already perfect to us and beautiful inside and out. It feels like living in a dream with you and our lives are now not complete without you in it. You are our whole world and heart, and no matter what happens in the future or where you go, you have our undying, unwavering, unconditional love. You are our inspiration in this life where everything is scary and uncertain, and I can’t thank you enough for blessing all of us by sacrificing so much of your time. We can’t wait to see where you go in the future. We will by your side for infinity and support you always. I pray that you and your loved ones stay safe, and find happiness and worth in the future. Happy birthday Jeon Jungkook, and we adore you so much!!!!!",1,2022-09-01T02:42:31Z

Here's what we would've been missing if they'd never relaxed into their own personal styles. 
J-hope without a smile. 
RM without dimples.
Jungkook without alternating adorable and super hot. 
Jimin without flirty or emotional dance faces.
This just proves even more that what I love about BTS is their individual styles and personalities all blending into one perfect band. Also, how hard they work to always  express themselves through their music and dances. <3",1,2022-08-18T19:32:05Z

@evelingomez1947,"One thing about BTS is that none of their songs, choreos, performances, and well simply all the content we get, IT NEVER GETS OLD. I became an army in March of 2015 just a couple months before their 3 year anniversary and I remember stumbling across all of these old dance practices and being so mesmerized by their talent and to this very day i still come back to watch these videos and it never fails to baffle me that this is the type of performances that they were going with when first debuting. They truly are amazing and becoming an Army since then has been one of my best decisions ever. I have laughed, cried, and cheered for these boys (now men) so much. They will forever remain in a special place in my heart.",0,2022-06-08T05:25:14Z

@whowhyyy,"진짜 이때 고유 방탄이다. 난 이 노래 안무가 제일 빡세고 방탄의 느낌이 나서 좋더라. 이 영상이 억뷰가 넘어야 하는데 왜 안 넘는거지 많이 알려졌으면 좋겠는데. 하 이런 느낌도 오랜만이다. 옛날 느낌 나서 갑자기 어릴 때 생각나고 우울해. 하 그냥 방탄 옛날 영상이랑 노래만 들으면 초등학생에서 중학생 넘어가는 봄방학에 새벽에 티비로 유튜브 켜놓고 맨날 방탄만 보던 그 시절이 떠올라서 왜인지 너무 슬퍼. 중1 초반에 진짜 힘들었었는데 사춘기가 그때 왔는지 하루 하루 우울하고 방탄을 너무 좋아하는데 못 본다는 현실도 힘들고...ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 지금 생각해보면 유치한데 그땐 그게 힘들어서 일기장에도 써놨었음ㅋㅋㅋ 솔직히 성인되고 나서부터는 방탄을 옛날처럼 열정적으로 좋아하는 건 아니지만 왜 중학생 때 좋아했던 사랑은 평생 기억에 남는다고 중딩 때 열렬히 좋아했던 사람들이라 그냥 이 마음은 평생 가는 것 같다. 상남자로 처음 1위 후보 올라간 거, 아니쥬로 처음 1위 한 거, mma에서 첫 대상 받은 거 난 다 생방으로 함께 했었다. 소리지르고 가족한테 자랑하고 내 일도 아닌데 정말 좋아했다... 연말만 되면 시상식 어플 깔아서 매일 광고 몇 개 씩 보고 투표하고,  방탄 컴백 날엔 6시만 설레게 기다리고 6시 넘으면 바로 뮤비 보고. 방탄 컴백주엔 음방 다 챙겨보고 언제 나올지 모르니까 처음부터 보기 시작해서 다른 그룹도 많이 알았지. 지금은 음방도 안 보니까 신인 누가 나왔는지 모르고 산다.. 순서가 일찍 나오면 엥 방탄이 왜 일찍 나와?! 늦게 나오면 역시 인기 많어 뿌듯해 하고ㅋㅋㅋ 이젠 완전 넘사벽 글로벌 그룹인데. 중1 댄저때 전북대에 방탄 온다고 난 그 날 현장학습 날이었는데 친구랑 현장학습 도중에 쌤한테 말씀드리고 나와서 다섯시간 기다리고 줄 서서 봤었는데 너무 열광해서 얼굴을 제대로 보지도 못 했다. 넘나 아쉬운 것 얼굴 기억이 진짜 1도 안 남.. 어쩄든 방탄 덕분에 내 사춘기 시절 심장 쿵쾅거리고 쫄리고 참 재밌었다. 지금은 무슨 낙에 사는지도 모르겠고 몇 시간 후면 학교 가고 바로 알바도 가야되는데 진짜 귀찮다... 하 진짜 알바 하기 싫다. 나도 편하게 푹 쉬고 싶다... 알바 한 군데는 곧 그만둬야 될 것 같은데 뭘 그만두지 이대로는 힘들어서 못 살어",1,2022-04-07T21:33:43Z

@h-playwithmyhart.4806,"J-Hope. Absolutely every aspect of you was lovable from the moment I saw you. Months went by, which turned into a year, and by that time I became completely immersed into you as a musician. I grew up surrounded by the type of music, rap, and sound that you are so familiar with and that you weave into each of your music pieces. It took me no time at all to realize that who you are as a person is communicated through your rapping style. None of your raps could ever sound the same, and yet you retain the signature characteristics that generate your sound with each one. You have such a playful sound, but also know how to emote in a way that reflects some of your most vulnerable moments. How you manage to capture the classic sound of old school hip hop and rap and combine with a more modernized style is beyond me. Your voice connects the past with the present and even creates a new future because you hold so much together at once.  I don’t believe I’d ever come across somebody with such a versatile voice before you. Your singing voice shares some of the qualities of your rap, but there is a softer, more delicate feel to it and it is simply perfection when you do either. I don’t even know where to begin with your dancing. Anybody can see, before they even get to know you, that you are dance. You have lived, breathed and represented dance your whole life. It’s beautiful how this art form gave you so much purpose and helped provide you with the lifestyle you have lived and will continue to live. You are limitless in your body movement, your expression, and your emotion. You are truly free when you dance. The passion you have for your craft is unstoppable and will always burn in you. I feel so fortunate to be born in this time period to get to be a part of it, because your dancing moves me in a way I know I will never be moved again. I am just so grateful for for you pursuing this feeling in your heart and sharing it with your ARMY and a the world for so long now. You have personalized dance and there will be no other that connects to it in the manner in which you do. The music world would not have transformed the way it has without you and your performances globally revolutionizing the art so greatly that your impact with be everlasting. I quickly learned that you really have a sense of humor unlike no other. You are naturally such a goofy, silly person and your jokes range from spontaneity to pranks you play on your members. When the situation is tense, you can always calm and ease it by bringing smiles to the faces of those around you. It really is a gift to be able to find the humor and light-heartedness in some of the grimmest times. You have over eight years of laughter-filled memories with your members and others who you have met during you in your life. After all, people may not remember you specifically, but they remember how you make them feel, and you are completely unforgettable. People can say that of course knowing somebody for this long will cause you to grow close with them, but the relationship that you have with your members is not held by anybody else on the Earth of trillions of people. It’s the day to day interactions that you have with them that might seem so small that give their lives so much meaning and purpose. You still look at them with the same admiration and pride that you did when you were just debuting. You have charmed your way into each of their hearts in your own special way. Only you can motivate them, pick them back up, put them back on their feet, and prevent them from giving up,. You have really believed in the notion of taking this journey together, and without you, BTS would not exist. Not only as a group, but there would never be this inseparable family between the seven of you, or the millions of fans, without your love. You are the heart of all of their lives and I know this by how happy they are and how they see the beauty of each day,. Without you to remind them, they would have never grown into the capable young men that they are today. I want to personally thank your parents and family for raising you and helping you become as wise, optimistic, and selfless as you are today. I hope you always remember that they love you and are the most proud of you than anybody else. Jung Hoseok, you are the lifeline of the ARMY. You always have such a calm and relaxed demeanor when you’re with us. In this way, you already treat us like your family and trust us enough to give us you in your natural state. The frequency in which you are updating us about your day to day emotions is already more than we expect because of your busy schedule. The fact that you always make time for us no matter what reveals your true character and who you are as a person. You value us so much and make us a part of you daily life. Your happiness is all we need to keep going and yet, you work your very hardest to keep us surprised and thrilled. You are more than a blessing and we can’t ever ask for you to do more, but you still insist on giving us more. You are the generosity that this world needs. I want to you to know that we have your whole heart and will always protect it with our entire being.  We will always support you, build you up, dry your tears, or even save you if you feel it! I hope in the darkest moments, you let us save yours because we love you with all that we have and then some.  You make us laugh, give us confidence, and take our fears away. You are our sunshine. Our happiness. Our whole heart. I know that you have been through so much in your life, both personally and professionally.  I want you to know, that ARMY will always want to share your pain with you. If not us, I hope you know that there are people who truly love you who will listen to you and help you when you’re feeling down. I am so proud of you for being so strong and persevering through all of your obstacles. You deserve all of the praise and success you’ve gotten and then some. I don’t want to flatter you too much or overwhelm you, but you truly are a person that has transformed the nature of this generation. I hope you continue to combat your hardships with the same determination moving forward. I hope that this birthday brings to you all of the love and blessings that you deserve. I hope it is all that you dream of and that it is as much fun as you are as a person!  Thank you for your endless years of sacrifice, doubts, pain, fear, hard work, effort, and fatigue just to make BTS work. We could never ask for more from you but your own happiness and well-being. I pray that you and your family members stay safe, and find happiness in the future. I hope that you continue to make your dreams come true and that you live your life well. We recognize each of your efforts and actions every day. Thank you for saving so many lives with your music and your kind soul. You are absolutely beautiful inside and out. Please don’t ever feel obligated or pressured to change, because we love and support you unconditionally. Most of all, you are our hope, always and forever. Happy birthday Jung Hoseok, and we adore you so much!",0,2022-02-18T09:18:31Z

@goku_lovesu7496,"The mystery of JK's hat EXPLAINED

He never wore a hat from the beginning. About 3:01, Jimin covered him as he kneels to get something from the floor. (He's pulled out 2 hats. One that he wore and one to do the magic with. ) 

When it's Jimin's turn, Jungkook's hands is already up in the air (which is kinda weird) at 3:12 Jimin then pretend to throw his hat. Jungkook already has another hat in his hands. (You can tell the difference by the print. Jungkook new hat is plain black. Jimin's original hat is the one is a big white print) Jimin wore his own hat at 3:16. And Jungkook's part ended up with him throwing his 2 hats.",241,2021-07-09T18:04:46Z

Para mí yo de 14 años:
Mira que nos volvimos diferente al crecer pero no dejamos de lado el amor y apoyo a estos chicos que me sacaron sonrisas en los momentos más tristes y difíciles de la vida que hemos tenido. También ellos tuvieron tiempos difíciles y me gustó haber recorrido el camino con estos nenes , grandes lecciones me han dejado y pues si la vida como adulto es dura (nos fue algo bien en la carrera que escogimos, no es la que tú soñaste en aquel tiempo, jejje  lamento decirte que  cambie de opinión a última hora de escoger, sorry nena pero verás que nos irá súper ay que ser positiva ante todo ;) vale ).

Ayyy los amo demasiado nenes

It was just a normal day in 2013 and my friend made me watch this at school. I’m a huge fan of hiphop so even tho I’m not into kpop that time, I was really amused. And when I found out that they just debuted that’s what made me so curious abt them and when I got home from school, I quickly searched them up & watched their no more dream & we are bulletproof pt 2 MVs. Plus I could clearly remember how I rlly interrupted my cousin in the shower just to remind her to watch their vids bc “THEY WERE INSANE” I was shouting like crazy “click click bang bang!!!

I wasn't that interested, but before I knew it, I was humming to their songs. Forward 1-2 years later, I was really into the kpop industry.

Being honest above everything.
Just wondering bts alot ARMY but also people admired bts alot too only they can’t watch concert they can’t watch youtube bcos they people can’t afford ot those to watch.
I’m not use to listen music specially kpop but once BTS FORM i love the music of bts it is really very unique. Trust me I only listen bts song.me myself don’t know WHY.
Even my boy same age with JIN JM JK 
They asked waaaoooo wondering i just listen bts song.

@taddlkekse,"this is from hobis biography.. i can only imagine how hard they work..


Once our debut was decided, practice got even harder. We filmed the dance for ‘We are bulletproof PT.2’ every day for three months leading to our debut, and even the slightest difference in angle between our bodies or movements in our fingers meant we had to film it again. Those days were truly difficult, I even collapsed on occasion. It’s an intense performance, so I injured myself lots. I even had too much blood accumulated in my feet and had to get it drawn out… We really suffered a lot. But it’s because we had that past that we were able to debut and receive the support of so many fans now. It feels like all our efforts and hard work until now have paid off.


 Also, I was interested in vocals as well as rap, so I took some lessons while I was a trainee. Those days were filled with so many lessons every day, I didn’t even have the freedom to go out and play. But that’s nothing compared to now, probably. Looking back now, I should have played more back then. (laughs)",15,2019-06-22T22:19:31Z

@glomalanga,"I love that choreography. I really love it. 💓 They have teased each others a lot about their dancing skills but i honestly think all of them are awesome at dancing. They are so good! Clean movements and all syncronized as far as I see. Some of them can take more time than others in learning a choreography but that doesn't affect the final result. Maybe it is a matter of asian culture when they say about themselves ""I am not a good dancer"" or ""i always mess it up"" but whenever they say that i am like you must be kidding. You cant be saying that seriously. I admire BTS a lot. They are great talents at dancing, singing and hard work and that is why i follow them proudly 😊👍",1,2019-06-06T04:36:29Z

-- Both their choreos are really difficult! Just look at this and N.O. The choreos and their performances would make you doubt if they're really rookies.

*DIFFERENCES*
-- BigHit doesn't allow TXT to show skin/abs anymore, not even in the dance practice video. In No More Dream, Jimin had a dance step where he kept turning while revealing his abs, while in here, they all had to pull up their shirts to show their abs, even the then-16 year old Jungkook.",1,2019-03-10T23:33:56Z

@fl3111,"The hat trick had me confused for a long time till I watch this dance practice. I discovered that Jimin didn't really pass his hat to JK.  JK back was to the camera,  when he turn around,  he had a hat in his hands already. We couldn't see it because of Jimin was in the way.  
When Jimin raise his hand to throw the hat, JK raised his hand too fast and too early,  that's how I noticed the whole trick. And when looking at the hat closely, you can see the differences.  Jimin hat had writing on the front while the one JK ""catches"" didn't.  

I missed JK rapping tbh. 😥",1,2018-07-18T06:58:38Z

@MyMusic1DLOVE,"April 9th, 2018. 
It's been 5 years now since I came across this video. At first, I thought it was a random boy group who did covers of others dances, but they turned out to be the owners of the song, and later on, my life wreckers. 
If you have been following them since then, and you watched all their dance practice videos until now, then came back and watched videos from 2013, you'll probably notice the huge improvement they made. 
What caught my attention the most was the way they were delivering the whole dance, if you watch closely, you'll notice how they are trying so hard to look ""swag"" or ""cool"", like every move looks forced somehow. It's the beginning of their journey and they have to catch people's attention with their dance. However  in their latest dance practice video, you can feel the ease and the confidence they gained through the years. It's like they own the world, they don't have to try that hard to look cool anymore, they already had stolen our hearts. 

It's so heartwarming to witness their evolution, it's like a flower blossoming on spring. 

BTS, thank you so much for everything.
You will always be in our hearts.",0,2018-04-09T22:03:26Z

Jungkook is barely 16. Yet they're working so hard, their moves are so precise. I'm gonna cry, they've come so so far.
Bangtan,  you've done all ARMYs proud. We love you,  and we will forever, even when you leave for the military,  even when you start dating, when you get married, when you have children, when your hair starts greying, we'll be there at the back, cheering you on.

@staydzy,"So back then when they debuted I watched the No More Dream MV and I was like “okay, I can get down with this.” I also was in love with Jungkook cause he was (and still is) a cutie. It was love at first sight from the MV haha. He was the one that made me stay for BTS. But it was THIS song (especially the choreo cause gosh darn the formations, synchronization and complexity is cray and so satisfying) was the thing that sold my soul to BTS. 

Ah I miss the good old days 😌 They, at that time, were my secret obsession since they weren’t very known back then. I was a little selfish and didn’t want others to know about them because they were my babys heh.. but obviously that wasn’t very successful 😂 man has it been a crazy ride these past few years",39,2018-01-15T05:00:52Z

@GiovannaGiav,"The producer that owns this studio posted a screenshot on their 4th anniversary of his own FB account, it was from 2013 after they debuted. In the screenshot there's a picture of them, the producer was saying there was a group of rookies training all night long and from all the rookies he saw back then they had the best energy. He now says he's really proud of their achievements. It was so cute 😭 back then these little fetuses didn't even know if they were going to succeed.",1,2017-06-17T22:50:37Z

@Rei-rw8os,"I love the transformation from this debut to now, 2017, with ""Spring Day"" and ""Not Today"". They went from being a hardcore hip hop group learning dances in a lesser priced basement to becoming worldwide idols everyone loves. The hardships they went through paid off, these seven boys being invited for American interviews, newscasts, even being nominated for Billboard Top Social Artist. Their teamwork throughout the years has gotten them high praise, as well as achieving their own dreams. True, I've only been an ARMY for a year now, I know a good, hardworking group when I see one. BTS really are bulletproof, taking out opponents and striving for the top. Each boy in this group earned my respect, and I adore each of them for who they are. Bangtan is a group that I think raises the bar of teamwork, and it shows. BTS, if you're reading this, thank you. You're music has given me hope in what I can accomplish. Thank you for existing.

@melikaaimes4609,"YOOO I can't explain how stupid I feel right now. 

After all these years and watching this video countless times I only just realised Jimin didn't really throw the hat to Jungkook and that is was a trick.
This whole time I thought that Jimin must of had two hats and that Jungkook being the ""Golden maknae"" just caught the hat with his super reflexes.
 
This to me is just like finding out that Santa is not really and that my whole life has been a life.

i was like wait ""there's 3 hats? where'd that other one come from??"" and then i realized that there was a hat in the back that kookie grabbed during jhope's dance part at 3:00 and i was shocked bc i thought for the longest time that jimin actually threw a hat to kookie! no wonder it looked so clean bc kookie already had a hat in his hand and it wasnt actually jimin's

@vulfpeck_fan_account,"just out of curiosity, why is jungkook so often the center (not complaining) but j hope and jimin would be more logical choices since they are dance specialties and the best dancer usually stand in the front to hide the bad dancers. also, short people usually stand near the front (jimin's pretty short) and even if not them, maybe jin and v because they are the visuals of the group or even suga and rap monster because they would have easier access to front center when they have their rap solo parts. im not upset, just wondering?",0,2015-03-26T03:22:03Z

While Hobi at 3:02 is dancing, Jin or someone in the back is giving Jungkook two hats , you can see one in the back of the room on the ground at 0:41, one hat to put his head and one behind him. When Hoseok does that amazing flattening thing at 3:06 Jimin comes with one hat on his head, he does this stuff and then takes off the hat on his head and pretends to throw it to jungkook. 3:14 You can see jungkook has his hand with the second hat behind his back, and you see Jimin put back on his hat at 3:15. Then Kookie does his stuff throwing both hats away… That wasn't clear but I hope you get the point. Maybe I was pointing out the obvious idk.",0,2015-03-15T23:10:09Z

I love the dance aspect of K-Pop and groups like SHINee and Infinite are some of my absolute favorites. However, I would argue that BTS is practically at the same level of dance skill and quality as these groups. Their style may be different and they may not have been around that long, but it has been a while since I have been blown away by a group's choreography. This was just... wow...

Much respect to the dance instructor/choreographer, and these boys for putting so much time, effort, and passion into their dances and performances. It really shows. Best wishes to this group.

This video makes me realize how easy GOT7 had it with their hip hop laidback style of choreo. I'm aware the styles of the group themselves are completely different, but the amount of sweat and blood that goes into their practice REALLY shows from just their dancing. Man.

@VampireMadonna,"That hat-trick is amazing. I mean, you can see the hat on the ground from the beginning but it's no less impressive. They did it so flawlessly that it can almost make you believe that it was magic.

I have to say, after only being a fan for exactly 7 days now(better late than never!), they are far more professional than any so-called ""rookie"" group I've ever seen in all the years that I've been into Kpop. I follow a lot of groups and I love them all but it's normal for them to be a bit of a mess when they first debut. There are some I even wondered about the longevity of their careers, thinking that the company should've held them back a while. I can't say that about BTS. They're not perfect and they do make mistakes on occasion but they're so TOGETHER and, more importantly, the level of talent is almost evenly matched throughout the group whereas I usually find one or two members in any group, regardless of size, that make me wonder what exactly they bring to the table other than a nice personality and cute face.

I'm not trying to insult anyone, hence why I'm not naming names, I'm just really impressed with these guys and after having pretty much given up on Kpop since it became redundant and repetitive in my eyes(and ears), I feel my interest stirring again, not just in Kpop but in hip-hop and rap as well and I have these boys to thank for that.",6,2014-04-19T19:05:35Z

@user-yh8jr8tk9z,"Extremely impressive... BTS is such a talented group. They are always on point no matter what. And it's not like many dancers, where they get tired in the middle of their performance or practice and begin to slack. I also love how they go from smooth moves (1:17) to sharp ones (like at 2:04). So many great things to notice and I could go on forever but they definitely deserve a ton of credit. Great video.",0,2013-10-10T23:36:15Z
