@soonh_526,캐럿이 된 지 1년도 되지 않았을 때 6주년 영상이 올라와서 너무 기뻤는데 하필이면 재계약 시기가 얼마 안 남았다길래 혹여나 완전체로 보지 못 하면 어떡하지 했는데 걱정이 무색하게도 약 두 달뒤 전원 재계약 이라는 공지글이 올라와서 말로 표현을 못 할 정도로 기쁘고 너무 신났었습니다 앞으로 이 좋은 사람들과 오래 함께 할 수 있다는 생각에 이 세상을 다 가진 기분이었는데 벌써 내년에 재계약이라니..... 시간이 이렇게 빠른 걸 보니 캐럿이 된 이후의 제 하루하루가 너무나도 행복했었나봅니다!! 이 빌어먹을 세상 속에서 한줄기의 빛같은 내 사람들(세븐틴 캐럿)을 또 한번 오래 볼 수 있기를 간절히 바랄게요 한명이라도 없으면 너무너무 허전한 세븐틴이에요 꼭 몇년 뒤에도 완전체로 볼 수 있기를 정말 제 모든 걸 걸고 빌어볼게요 🥺🩷🩵,3,2025-03-23T05:31:21Z

@violet-tq5ul,"I cried while listening to this song without understanding much but it made me so emotional multiple times. And just recently, I looked up the lyrics translated into English, I found myself just weeping and sobbing. 

Thank you Woozi, Bumzu and all the members for putting out such beautiful pieces of art in the world. I became a carat around 2 years ago, but each season I get stuck on new songs that were released years ago. Before becoming a carat, K-pop songs rarely could make me cry, but with Seventeen..there are separate playlists for such moments. It's so beautiful that we all as human beings can feel such deep and intense emotions when listening to creations of other just the same human beings. There's so much love and admiration that I can't seem to put into words. I just hope that all the members feel loved and fulfilled.

I recently discovered this song, and from Carat's comments and the emotions they brought on this song (that's why I fell in love with Seventeen, they're such a storyteller, full of emotions) I've known the meaning without even need to search the full translation. Beautiful
Another thing I love about them, we don't really need any other guitar cover or remixes from anyone because they already did it themselves. 
The first time I heard this song, I really love Woozi's intro with the guitar... But the continuation of the song is really not what I expected, 'cause I really want the guitar to somehow still going throughout the song or at least popped again at some part of the song. But no.. 
So here I am today, searching a guitar cover of this song, and delighted to find this, another acoustic ver. by Seventeen themselves and I absolutely LOVE this version more. It needs to be on music streaming services 😍🎉

내 사랑은 겨우 이것밖에 않돼

Hey

(간주)

안녕 나의 기쁨이여
깊은 절망에도
항상웃게해
By my side
잠시 모든걸 잊게해줘

아는 노랠 틀고 One step
두손을 잡고 발을 Two step
어느세 오늘의 나에게 내일의 너를 바라게해

Baby it's alright
Oh,it's okay
내 거짓말 다 아는건 너뿐이라 O ah
더 고마워

가끔은 지쳐 고개숙여 우는 널 볼때
어쩔줄 모르는 난 뭘할수있을까
정말 미안해

내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안돼
그래도 내곁에 있어줘서 고마워
My baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내마음이 겨우 이런 말해

쏟아지는 유성우처럼
까만하늘의 빛이 돼줘
I can do everything tor you
난 너에게 뭐든지 다 주고싶은 마음만 커서
작아지는 나는 받기만 하는 바보

어느세 내가 미워서
너에게 더욱 미안해

Baby it's alright
Oh,it's okay
내 거짓말 다 아는건 너뿐이라 O ah
더 고마워

가끔은 지쳐 고개숙여 우는 널 볼때
어쩔줄 몰라하는 난 뭘할수있을까
정말 미안해

내사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안돼
그래도 내곁에 있어줘서 고마워
My baby
내사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런말해

어렵게 내마음을 적은 이노래와 가사뿐이지만
For you for you for you for you
이 노랜 널위해 불러 Tonight
니 사랑에 더욱 다가갈수 있게

내사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안돼 
그래도 내맘 변치않아
너에게만

내 사랑은 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼

안녕, 나의 기쁨이여
깊은 절망에도
항상 웃게 해 by my side
잠시 모든 걸 잊게 해 줘
아는 노랠 틀고 one step
두 손을 잡고 발을 two step
어느새 오늘의 나에게
내일의 널 바라게 해
Baby it's alright
Oh it's okay
내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라, oh ah 더 고마워
가끔은 지쳐
고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때
어쩔 줄 모르는 난 뭘 할 수 있을까
정말 미안해
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 고마워 my baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해
쏟아지는 유성우처럼
까만 하늘에 빛이 돼 줘
I can do everything for you
난 너에게
뭐든지 다 주고 싶은 마음만 커서
작아지는 나는 받기만 하는 바보
어느새 내가 미워서
너에게 더욱 미안해
Baby it's alright
Oh it's okay
내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라, oh ah 더 고마워
가끔은 지쳐
고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때
어쩔 줄 모르는 난 뭘 할 수 있을까
정말 미안해
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 고마워 my baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해
어렵게 내 마음 적은
이 노래와 가사뿐이지만
For you, for you, for you, for you
이 노랜 널 위해 불러 tonight
네 사랑에 다가갈 수 있게
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 마음은 변치 않아 너에게만 baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
비 내리는 너의 우산이 돼 줄게
지켜줄게 너의 모든 날에",1,2024-03-05T04:56:23Z

안녕, 나의 기쁨이여
깊은 절망에도

아는 노랠 틀고 One step
두 손을 잡고 발을 Two step
어느새 오늘의 나에게
내일의 널 바라게 해

Baby It's alright
Oh It's okay

내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라, O ah 더 고마워

가끔은 지쳐
고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때
어쩔 줄 모르는 난 뭘 할 수 있을까
정말 미안해

그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 고마워 My baby

I can do everything for you
난 너에게

뭐든지 다 주고 싶은 마음만 커서
작아지는 나는 받기만 하는 바보
어느새 내가 미워서
너에게 더욱 미안해

안녕, 나의 기쁨이여
Hi, my joy

깊은 절망에도
Even in my deep despairs

항상 웃게 해 By my side
You always make me laugh by my side

잠시 모든 걸 잊게 해 줘
Momentarily it makes me forget about everything

아는 노랠 틀고 One step
Turn on a song we know and take one step

두 손을 잡고 발을 Two step
Hold hands and our feet move two step

어느새 오늘의 나에게 내일의 널 바라게 해
Somehow you make today’s me look forward to tomorrow’s you

Baby It's alright
Oh It's okay
 
내 거짓말 다 아는 건 너뿐이라
Because it’s only you who knows all my lies

O ah 더 고마워
O ah I’m more thankful

가끔은 지쳐 고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때
Sometimes when tired and I see you with your head down crying

어쩔 줄 모르는 난 뭘 할 수 있을까
Me, who doesn’t know what to do, what can I possibly do?

정말 미안해
Really, I’m sorry

 
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
My love only amounts to this

그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 고마워 My baby
But thank you for staying by my side my baby

내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
Even if my love only amounts to this

어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
Any winter, I’ll be your spring

내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해
My heart can only say these words



쏟아지는 유성우처럼
Like a spilling meteor shower

까만 하늘에 빛이 돼 줘
Be a light in the dark sky

I can do everything for you

난 너에게 뭐든지 다 주고 싶은 마음만 커서
I only have a big heart that wants to give you everything

작아지는 나는 받기만 하는 바보
Me, who is becoming smaller, a fool who only receives

어느새 내가 미워서
At some point, I started hating myself

너에게 더욱 미안해
Towards you I’m even more sorry

Baby It's alright
Oh It's okay

내 거짓말 다 아는 건 너뿐이라
Because it’s only you who knows all my lies

O ah 더 고마워
O ah I’m more thankful

가끔은 지쳐 고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때
Sometimes when tired and I see you with your head down crying

Any winter, I’ll be your spring

내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해
My heart can only say these words


 
어렵게 내 마음 적은 이 노래와 가사뿐이지만
It’s just this song and lyrics I wrote about my feelings with difficulty, but

For you for you for you for you
 
이 노랜 널 위해 불러 Tonight
I sing this song for you tonight

네 사랑에 다가갈 수 있게
So that I can get closer to your love

 
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
My love only amounts to this

그래도 내 마음은 변치 않아 너에게만 Baby
But my heart won’t change, it’s only for you baby

내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
Even if my love only amounts to this

비 내리는 너의 우산이 돼 줄게
I’ll be your umbrella when it rains

두 손을 잡고 발을 two step
어느새 오늘의 나에게
내일의 널 바라게 해
Baby it's alright
Oh it's okay
내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라, oh ah 더 고마워
가끔은 지쳐
고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때
어쩔 줄 모르는 난 뭘 할 수 있을까
정말 미안해
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 고마워 my baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해
쏟아지는 유성우처럼
까만 하늘에 빛이 돼 줘
I can do everything for you
난 너에게
뭐든지 다 주고 싶은 마음만 커서
작아지는 나는 받기만 하는 바보
어느새 내가 미워서
너에게 더욱 미안해
Baby it's alright
Oh it's okay
내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라, oh ah 더 고마워
가끔은 지쳐
고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때

내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 고마워 my baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해
어렵게 내 마음 적은
이 노래와 가사뿐이지만
For you, for you, for you, for you
이 노랜 널 위해 불러 tonight
네 사랑에 다가갈 수 있게
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 마음은 변치 않아 너에게만 baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
비 내리는 너의 우산이 돼 줄게
지켜줄게 너의 모든 날에",0,2023-10-11T18:46:11Z

연차가 쌓여서 나태해질수도있는데..
더 연습하고 노력해서 멋있음

안녕, 나의 기쁨이여
깊은 절망에도 
항상 웃게 해 By my side
잠시 모든 걸 잊게 해 줘
아는 노랠 틀고 One step
두 손을 잡고 발을 Two step
어느새 오늘의 나에게
내일의 널 바라게 해
Baby It's alright
Oh It's okay
내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라, O ah 더 고마워
가끔은 지쳐
고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때 
어쩔 줄 모르는 난 뭘 할 수 있을까
정말 미안해
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 고마워 My baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해
쏟아지는 유성우처럼
까만 하늘에 빛이 돼 줘
I can do everything for you
난 너에게
뭐든지 다 주고 싶은 마음만 커서
작아지는 나는 받기만 하는 바보
어느새 내가 미워서
너에게 더욱 미안해
Baby It's alright
Oh It's okay
내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라, O ah 더 고마워 
가끔은 지쳐
고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때 
어쩔 줄 모르는 난 뭘 할 수 있을까
정말 미안해
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 고마워 My baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해
어렵게 내 마음 적은
이 노래와 가사뿐이지만
For you for you for you for you
이 노랜 널 위해 불러 Tonight
네 사랑에 다가갈 수 있게
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 마음은 변치 않아 너에게만 Baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
비 내리는 너의 우산이 돼 줄게
지켜줄게 너의 모든 날에",3,2023-05-31T22:02:59Z
@효링-x7g,"안녕 나의 기쁨이여
이 노래는 항상 들으면 울컥하게 되는데
이 영상이랑 같이 보면 항상 울게 되더라.
가사가 너무 이뻐서 매 번 위로가 되어주는것 같아. 속상하고 힘들 때 마다 나를 이렇게 사랑해주는 사람들이 있다는 생각을 하면 진짜 너무 고마워 뭐라도 다 주고만 싶어져.

어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해

항상 우릴 위해서 노래해줘서 고마워.

@기기대기대,"겨우가 진짜 사람 미치게 하는 노래네 난 이걸 왜 이제알았지 진짜 하...
'안녕 나의 기쁨이여' 상대방을 자신의 기쁨 이라고 표현할 정도로, 내가 절망을 하는 중에도 상대만 보면 웃음이 나오고 아픔과 힘듦을 잊게 할 정도로 상대에 대한 마음이 큰데 그런 마음을 겨우라고 표현하고

내가 너에게 주는 사랑보다 네가 나에게 주는 마음이 더 커서 너는 내가 힘들때 나를 일으켜 세우는 원동력이고 너만 보면 웃음이 나올 정도로 나의 기쁨인데 날 일으켜 세우고 웃게하는 너에 비해 난 네가 힘들어할때를 알아차려서 직접 위로해주지도 못하고 노래 가사로 간접적으로만 위로해줄 수 있으니
너가 나에게 준 것에 비해 내가 너에게 주는 마음이 턱없이 부족하게 느껴져서 겨우 이 정도의 사랑 표현밖에 못해서 미안하다는거아냐 진짜 미쳤네 아 돌아버리겠다진짜 과몰입 어쩔거냐거",92,2023-04-19T13:09:34Z

@Belieberbtch,"[Intro: WOOZI]
My love only amounts to this

[Verse 1: Jeonghan, Vernon, WONWOO]
Hello, my joy
Even in deep despair
You always make me laugh, by my side
You let me forget everything for a moment
Play a song I know and one step
Hold my hands and put my feet in, two steps
Before I know it, the me of today
Hopes for the you of tomorrow

[Pre-Chorus: Joshua, HOSHI, Jun]
Baby, it's alright
Oh, it's okay
The person to know all my secrets
Is you, oh-ah, so I'm even more thankful
Sometimes when you get tired
And I see you crying with your head down
I don't know what to do, what can I do
I'm really sorry

[Chorus: Dino, DK, S.Coups]
My love only amounts to this
But thank you for staying by my side, my baby
Even if my love only amountsto this
I'll be your spring to whatevеr winter it may be
This is all my heart can say

[Verse 2: WONWOO, Seungkwan, MINGYU, S.Coups]
Just likе a pouring meteor shower
Please be the light in the dark sky
I can do everything for you
For you
I just want to give you everything
And that makes me feel small, a fool who only accepts
It suddenly makes me hate myself
And makes me feel sorrier towards you

[Pre-Chorus: WOOZI, THE 8, HOSHI]
Baby, it's alright
Oh, it's okay
The person to know all my secrets
Is you, oh-ah, so I'm even more thankful
Sometimes when you get tired
And I see you crying with your head down
I don't know what to do, what can I do
I'm really sorry

[Chorus: DK, MINGYU, Vernon]
My love only amounts to this
But thank you for staying by my side, my baby
Even if my love only amounts to this
I'll be your spring to whatever winter it may be
This is all my heart can say

[Bridge: Dino, DK, Seungkwan]
Though it was hard writing my feelings down
And all I have is this song and these lyrics
For you, for you, for you, for you
I sing this song for you tonight
So I can get closer to your love

[Chorus: Joshua, Jun, Jeonghan]
My love only amounts to this
But my feelings will never change, for you baby
Even if my love only amounts to this
I'll be your umbrella in the rain
I'll protect you on all your days",163,2023-03-23T01:32:36Z

안녕, 나의 기쁨이여
깊은 절망에도 
항상 웃게 해 By my side
잠시 모든 걸 잊게 해 줘
아는 노랠 틀고 One step
두 손을 잡고 발을 Two step
어느새 오늘의 나에게
내일의 널 바라게 해
Baby It's alright
Oh It's okay
내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라, O ah 더 고마워
가끔은 지쳐
고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때 
어쩔 줄 모르는 난 뭘 할 수 있을까
정말 미안해
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 고마워 My baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해
쏟아지는 유성우처럼
까만 하늘에 빛이 돼 줘
I can do everything for you
난 너에게
뭐든지 다 주고 싶은 마음만 커서
작아지는 나는 받기만 하는 바보
어느새 내가 미워서
너에게 더욱 미안해
Baby It's alright
Oh It's okay
내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라, O ah 더 고마워 
가끔은 지쳐
고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때 
어쩔 줄 모르는 난 뭘 할 수 있을까
정말 미안해
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 고마워 My baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해
어렵게 내 마음 적은
이 노래와 가사뿐이지만
For you for you for you for you
이 노랜 널 위해 불러 Tonight
네 사랑에 다가갈 수 있게
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 마음은 변치 않아 너에게만 Baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
비 내리는 너의 우산이 돼 줄게
지켜줄게 너의 모든 날에",19,2023-01-18T17:43:47Z

내 사랑은 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
안녕, 나의 기쁨이여
깊은 절망에도
항상 웃게 해 By my side
잠시 모든 걸 잊게 해 줘
아는 노랠 틀고 One step
두 손을 잡고 발을 Two step
어느새 오늘의 나에게
내일의 널 바라게 해
Baby It's alright
Oh It's okay
내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라, O ah 더 고마워
가끔은 지쳐
고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때
어쩔 줄 모르는 난 뭘 할 수 있을까
정말 미안해
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 고마워 My baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해
쏟아지는 유성우처럼
까만 하늘에 빛이 돼 줘
I can do everything for you
난 너에게
뭐든지 다 주고 싶은 마음만 커서
작아지는 나는 받기만 하는 바보
어느새 내가 미워서
너에게 더욱 미안해
Baby It's alright
Oh It's okay
내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라, O ah 더 고마워
가끔은 지쳐
고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때
어쩔 줄 모르는 난 뭘 할 수 있을까
정말 미안해
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 고마워 My baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해
어렵게 내 마음 적은
이 노래와 가사뿐이지만
For you for you for you for you
이 노랜 널 위해 불러 Tonight
네 사랑에 다가갈 수 있게
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 마음은 변치 않아 너에게만 Baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
비 내리는 너의 우산이 돼 줄게
지켜줄게 너의 모든 날에",9,2022-11-04T11:03:57Z

@byjasmine7860,"Hi Carat. I am a newborn baby last September. I just followed Seventeen. So still a beginner to Carat, hihi. I know them from the song Hot and really like this song + Together + Hug + Pinwheel + many more T_T I see they have their own light. None of the members stood out on their own. All shone evenly with their respective rays. That's what amazed me with this group. I really love them now. How can they change my mood for the better with just one clip. Thank you for being there and being there on my difficult days. SEVENTEEN, YOU ARE THE BEST <3",25,2022-10-12T08:01:08Z

두 손을 잡고 발을 two step

내일의 널 바라게 해
Baby it's alright
Oh it's okay

너뿐이라, oh ah 더 고마워

쏟아지는 유성우처럼
까만 하늘에 빛이 돼 줘
I can do everything for you

뭐든지 다 주고 싶은 마음만 커서
작아지는 나는 받기만 하는 바보

너에게 더욱 미안해

그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 고마워 my baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해
어렵게 내 마음 적은
이 노래와 가사뿐이지만
For you, for you, for you, for you
이 노랜 널 위해 불러 tonight
네 사랑에 다가갈 수 있게
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 마음은 변치 않아 너에게만 baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
비 내리는 너의 우산이 돼 줄게
지켜줄게 너의 모든 날에",2,2022-09-10T14:12:27Z

안녕, 나의 기쁨이여
깊은 절망에도
항상 웃게 해 by my side
잠시 모든 걸 잊게 해 줘

아는 노랠 틀고 one step
두 손을 잡고 발을 two step
어느새 오늘의 나에게
내일의 널 바라게 해

Baby it's alright
Oh it's okay

내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라, oh ah 더 고마워

가끔은 지쳐
고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때
어쩔 줄 모르는 난 뭘 할 수 있을까
정말 미안해

내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 고마워 my baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해

쏟아지는 유성우처럼
까만 하늘에 빛이 돼 줘
I can do everything for you
난 너에게

뭐든지 다 주고 싶은 마음만 커서
작아지는 나는 받기만 하는 바보
어느새 내가 미워서
너에게 더욱 미안해

Baby it's alright
Oh it's okay

내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라, oh ah 더 고마워

가끔은 지쳐
고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때
어쩔 줄 모르는 난 뭘 할 수 있을까
정말 미안해

내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 고마워 my baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해

어렵게 내 마음 적은
이 노래와 가사뿐이지만
For you, for you, for you, for you

이 노랜 널 위해 불러 tonight
네 사랑에 다가갈 수 있게

내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 마음은 변치 않아 너에게만 baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
비 내리는 너의 우산이 돼 줄게
지켜줄게 너의 모든 날에",7,2022-07-07T14:02:42Z

@DayandNight-utb,"나 또 들으러 왔네 ,, 이 영상은 언제봐도 새롭고 예쁘고 아름답고 벅차오른다 정말로 
배경도 너무 예쁘고 흰티에 청바지 코디도 다들 너무 찰떡이야
노래 가사 하나하나 음 하나하나 소중하게 불러주고 마음을 꾹꾹 눌러담아줘서 너무 고마워
겨우는 특히 가사가 정말 정말 예쁘기 때문에 계속 듣게 되고 듣는 내내 감탄하고 ,,
진짜 우리가 해주고 싶고 해줘야 될 얘기들을 노래해주는 이런 가수가 ..어딨냐고 진짜로 ,,
누가 뭐래도 서로만 믿고 가고 사랑할게♥️✨",127,2022-07-04T02:11:08Z

@aivongeorge5617,I've lost count on how many times I have watched this...I guess it has now become a sort of habit of mine to come here once in a while to this haven and be in this trance for a  couple of minutes...,6,2022-05-31T11:06:51Z
@gxly,every time I discovered svt songs it always leave me an impression of how good the music was perfectly composed and how it is possible to make me feel loved and helpless with my situation got me thinking that they are days when I feel so loved and contented and also days when I can't do anything but to say  'it is what it is' and proceed to go on with life. And this song hit so hard. Tha first time I heard this was when I am struggling but idk yet what does the lyrics means. I find the melody soft (idk the correct term but that's the feeling I got when I listened to this) and somehow comforting yet sad.,21,2022-05-31T09:55:01Z

I told my boyfriend my story with seventeen and he was happy that they make me happy, so he supports me as a carat, because for the 2020 MAMA we watch it together and was cheering for them (even tho, he doesn't listen to kpop that he really liked mamamoo) he liked a lot semicolon album, specially Light a Flame and for my birthday he gifted me the new lightstick.

And what a wonderful time to dedicate this song to him because they're my two favorite people in the world. 💙",4,2022-05-20T21:08:31Z

@Forgetalltheshootingstars,세븐틴이 내 인생에 너무 많은 영향을 줘서 몇 십 년이 지나도.. 18세의 내가 미래의 나이가 많이 들어 88세의 할머니가 되도 세븐틴을 잊지 못할거야ㅠㅠㅠㅜㅜ 미래의 세봉이들의 음악을 들으면서 다시 오늘날의 세봉이들을 떠올리며서 캐럿봉 흔들면서 응원법 외치고 있겠지... 💖💙💎,18,2022-04-28T05:47:18Z

Like this song basically says that they are sorry for loving us only as their fans, ""my love only amounts to this"" and how they want to give so much to us than just a song and its lyrics... but also sends the mssg that they are so thankful for us to love them nonetheless, ""it's alright, it's okay, I'm more thankful of you"".i have never heard a more realistic song. Most songs that idols dedicate to their fans basically say that wanna stay with them forever and how they will do anything for them but we know those are really unrealistic things to say, but here we have svt giving us a song that defines our relationship with them which them being so thankful to us for our presence and words of encouragement that it's their biggest strength",1199,2022-04-12T12:13:02Z

내 사랑은 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
안녕, 나의 기쁨이여
깊은 절망에도
항상 웃게 해 by my side
잠시 모든 걸 잊게 해 줘
아는 노랠 틀고 one step
두 손을 잡고 발을 two step
어느새 오늘의 나에게
내일의 널 바라게 해
Baby it's alright
Oh it's okay
내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라, oh ah 더 고마워
가끔은 지쳐
고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때
어쩔 줄 모르는 난 뭘 할 수 있을까
정말 미안해
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 고마워 my baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해
쏟아지는 유성우처럼
까만 하늘에 빛이 돼 줘
I can do everything for you
난 너에게
뭐든지 다 주고 싶은 마음만 커서
작아지는 나는 받기만 하는 바보
어느새 내가 미워서
너에게 더욱 미안해
Baby it's alright
Oh it's okay
내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라, oh ah 더 고마워
가끔은 지쳐
고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때
어쩔 줄 모르는 난 뭘 할 수 있을까
정말 미안해
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 고마워 my baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해
어렵게 내 마음 적은
이 노래와 가사뿐이지만
For you, for you, for you, for you
이 노랜 널 위해 불러 tonight
네 사랑에 다가갈 수 있게
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 마음은 변치 않아 너에게만 baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
비 내리는 너의 우산이 돼 줄게
지켜줄게 너의 모든 날에",1,2022-03-01T18:41:30Z

Dan mereka tuh bener2 berkembang bareng2, semua member ada credit nulis lagu+composing. Pas ada dance nya juga yg center bukan hanya main dance aja tp Semua kebagian center.

Hello, my joy
Even in deep despair
Always make me laugh, by my side
Let me forget everything for a moment
Play a song you know and one step
Hold your hands and put your feet in, two steps
To me today
I make you wish for tomorrow

Baby, it's alright
Oh, it's okay
Knowing all my lies
It's just you, oh-ah, thank you more
Sometimes tired
When I see you crying with my head down
I don't know what to do, what can I do
I'm really sorry

My love is only this
Thanks for staying by my side though, my baby
Even if my love is only this
Any winter, it will be your spring
My heart barely says this

Like a pouring meteor shower
Be a light in the black sky
I can do everything for you
I am to you
I only want to givе anything and everything
I'm getting smallеr, a fool who only accepts
I hate myself
I'm even more sorry for you

Baby, it's alright
Oh, it's okay
Knowing all my lies
It's just you, oh-ah, thank you more
Sometimes tired
When I see you crying with my head down
I don't know what to do, what can I do
I'm really sorry

My love is only this
Thanks for staying by my side though, my baby
Even if my love is only this
Any winter, it will be your spring
My heart barely says this

Hardly my heart
Only this song and lyrics
For you, for you, for you, for you
Sing this song for you tonight
So I can approach your love

My love is only this
But my heart won't change, only for you baby
Even if my love is only this

I'll protect you on all your days",39,2022-02-05T19:36:14Z

안녕, 나의 기쁨이여
깊은 절망에도
항상 웃게 해 by my side
잠시 모든 걸 잊게 해 줘
아는 노랠 틀고 one step
두 손을 잡고 발을 two step
어느새 오늘의 나에게
내일의 널 바라게 해
Baby it's alright
Oh it's okay
내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라, oh ah 더 고마워
가끔은 지쳐
고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때
어쩔 줄 모르는 난 뭘 할 수 있을까
정말 미안해
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 고마워 my baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게

쏟아지는 유성우처럼
까만 하늘에 빛이 돼 줘
I can do everything for you

내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해
어렵게 내 마음 적은
이 노래와 가사뿐이지만
For you, for you, for you, for you
이 노랜 널 위해 불러 tonight
네 사랑에 다가갈 수 있게
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 마음은 변치 않아 너에게만 baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도

지켜줄게 너의 모든 날에",1,2022-01-05T08:07:12Z

@yj8211,"My love is only this

Hello my joy
Even in deep despair
Always make me laugh By my side
Let me forget everything for a moment

Play a song you know and one step
Hold your hands and put your feet in two steps
To me today
I make you wish for tomorrow

Baby It's alright
Oh It's okay

Knowing all my lies
It's just you, O ah, thank you more

Sometimes tired
When I see you crying with my head down
I don't know what to do, what can I do
I'm really sorry

My love is only this
Thanks for staying by my side though, my baby
Even if my love is only this
Any winter, it will be your spring
My heart barely says this

Like a pouring meteor shower
Be a light in the black sky
I can do everything for you
I am to you

I only want to givе anything and everything
I'm getting smallеr, a fool who only accepts
I hate myself
I'm even more sorry for you

Baby It's alright
Oh It's okay

Knowing all my lies
It's just you, O ah, thank you more

Sometimes tired
When I see you crying with my head down
I don't know what to do, what can I do
I'm really sorry

My love is only this
Thanks for staying by my side though, my baby
Even if my love is only this
Any winter, it will be your spring
My heart barely says this

Hardly my heart
Only this song and lyrics
For you for you for you for you

Sing this song for you Tonight
So I can approach your love

My love is only this
But my heart won't change, only for you baby
Even if my love is only this
I'll become your umbrella in the rain
I'll protect you on all your days",11,2021-12-22T12:19:41Z

Baby it's alright
Oh it's okay
내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라, oh ah 더 고마워

고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때
어쩔 줄 모르는 난 뭘 할 수 있을까
정말 미안해
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 고마워 my baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해
어렵게 내 마음 적은
이 노래와 가사뿐이지만
For you, for you, for you, for you
이 노랜 널 위해 불러 tonight
네 사랑에 다가갈 수 있게
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 마음은 변치 않아 너에게만 baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
비 내리는 너의 우산이 돼 줄게

And all they want is to be a comforting presence in our lives. That making a positive impact, is what they strive for. And if we experienced that with them, they're proud that they were able to be this figure. And it makes me feel comforted that as much as I helped them, they helped me in return by doing their best and showing me amazing music. There's nothing I appreciate more. We all have our own lives to live, but for right now, all I really need is seventeen to comfort me right now.",3,2021-10-20T03:04:38Z

Hello my joy
Even in deep despair
Always make me laugh By my side
Let me forget everything for a moment

Play a song you know and one step
Hold your hands and put your feet in two steps
To me today
I make you wish for tomorrow

Baby It's alright
Oh It's okay

Knowing all my lies
It's just you, O ah, thank you more

Sometimes tired
When I see you crying with my head down
I don't know what to do, what can I do
I'm really sorry

My love is only this
Thanks for staying by my side though, my baby
Even if my love is only this
Any winter, it will be your spring
My heart barely says this

Like a pouring meteor shower
Be a light in the black sky
I can do everything for you
I am to you

I only want to givе anything and everything
I'm getting smallеr, a fool who only accepts
I hate myself
I'm even more sorry for you

Baby It's alright
Oh It's okay

Knowing all my lies
It's just you, O ah, thank you more

Sometimes tired
When I see you crying with my head down
I don't know what to do, what can I do
I'm really sorry

My love is only this
Thanks for staying by my side though, my baby
Even if my love is only this
Any winter, it will be your spring
My heart barely says this

Hardly my heart
Only this song and lyrics
For you for you for you for you

Sing this song for you Tonight
So I can approach your love

My love is only this
But my heart won't change, only for you baby
Even if my love is only this
I'll become your umbrella in the rain
I'll protect you on all your days",3,2021-10-14T02:48:17Z

안녕, 나의 기쁨이여
깊은 절망에도
항상 웃게 해 by my side
잠시 모든 걸 잊게 해 줘

아는 노랠 틀고 one step
두 손을 잡고 발을 two step
어느새 오늘의 나에게
내일의 널 바라게 해

Baby it's alright
Oh it's okay

내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라, oh ah 더 고마워

가끔은 지쳐
고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때
어쩔 줄 모르는 난 뭘 할 수 있을까
정말 미안해

내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 고마워 my baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해

쏟아지는 유성우처럼
까만 하늘에 빛이 돼 줘
I can do everything for you
난 너에게

뭐든지 다 주고 싶은 마음만 커서
작아지는 나는 받기만 하는 바보
어느새 내가 미워서
너에게 더욱 미안해

Baby it's alright
Oh it's okay

내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라, oh ah 더 고마워

가끔은 지쳐
고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때
어쩔 줄 모르는 난 뭘 할 수 있을까
정말 미안해

내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 고마워 my baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해

어렵게 내 마음 적은
이 노래와 가사뿐이지만
For you, for you, for you, for you

이 노랜 널 위해 불러 tonight
네 사랑에 다가갈 수 있게

내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 마음은 변치 않아 너에게만 baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
비 내리는 너의 우산이 돼 줄게
지켜줄게 너의 모든 날에",2,2021-08-15T04:28:35Z

안녕, 나의 기쁨이여
깊은 절망에도
항상 웃게 해 by my side
잠시 모든 걸 잊게 해 줘
아는 노랠 틀고 one step
두 손을 잡고 발을 two step
어느새 오늘의 나에게
내일의 널 바라게 해
Baby it's alright
Oh it's okay
내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라, oh ah 더 고마워
가끔은 지쳐
고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때
어쩔 줄 모르는 난 뭘 할 수 있을까
정말 미안해
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 고마워 my baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해
쏟아지는 유성우처럼
까만 하늘에 빛이 돼 줘
I can do everything for you
난 너에게
뭐든지 다 주고 싶은 마음만 커서
작아지는 나는 받기만 하는 바보
어느새 내가 미워서
너에게 더욱 미안해
Baby it's alright
Oh it's okay
내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라, oh ah 더 고마워
가끔은 지쳐
고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때
어쩔 줄 모르는 난 뭘 할 수 있을까
정말 미안해
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 고마워 my baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해
어렵게 내 마음 적은
이 노래와 가사뿐이지만
For you, for you, for you, for you
이 노랜 널 위해 불러 tonight
네 사랑에 다가갈 수 있게
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 마음은 변치 않아 너에게만 baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
비 내리는 너의 우산이 돼 줄게
지켜줄게 너의 모든 날에",3,2021-07-12T01:27:59Z

[Korean]
내 사랑은 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼

안녕, 나의 기쁨이여
깊은 절망에도
항상 웃게 해 by my side
잠시 모든 걸 잊게 해 줘

아는 노랠 틀고 one step
두 손을 잡고 발을 two step
어느새 오늘의 나에게
내일의 널 바라게 해

Baby it's alright
Oh it's okay

내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라, oh ah 더 고마워

가끔은 지쳐
고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때
어쩔 줄 모르는 난 뭘 할 수 있을까
정말 미안해

내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 고마워 my baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해

쏟아지는 유성우처럼
까만 하늘에 빛이 돼 줘
I can do everything for you
난 너에게

뭐든지 다 주고 싶은 마음만 커서
작아지는 나는 받기만 하는 바보
어느새 내가 미워서
너에게 더욱 미안해

Baby it's alright
Oh it's okay

내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라, oh ah 더 고마워

가끔은 지쳐
고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때
어쩔 줄 모르는 난 뭘 할 수 있을까
정말 미안해

내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 고마워 my baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해

어렵게 내 마음 적은
이 노래와 가사뿐이지만
For you, for you, for you, for you

이 노랜 널 위해 불러 tonight
네 사랑에 다가갈 수 있게

내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 마음은 변치 않아 너에게만 baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
비 내리는 너의 우산이 돼 줄게
지켜줄게 너의 모든 날에

My love is only this

Hello my joy
Even in deep despair
Always make me laugh By my side
Let me forget everything for a moment

Play a song you know and one step
Hold your hands and put your feet in two steps
To me today
I make you wish for tomorrow

Baby It's alright
Oh It's okay

Knowing all my lies
It's just you, O ah, thank you more

Sometimes tired
When I see you crying with my head down
I don't know what to do, what can I do
I'm really sorry

My love is only this
Thanks for staying by my side though, my baby
Even if my love is only this
Any winter, it will be your spring
My heart barely says this

Like a pouring meteor shower
Be a light in the black sky
I can do everything for you
I am to you

I only want to givе anything and everything
I'm getting smallеr, a fool who only accepts
I hate myself
I'm even more sorry for you

Baby It's alright
Oh It's okay

Knowing all my lies
It's just you, O ah, thank you more

Sometimes tired
When I see you crying with my head down
I don't know what to do, what can I do
I'm really sorry

My love is only this
Thanks for staying by my side though, my baby
Even if my love is only this
Any winter, it will be your spring
My heart barely says this

Hardly my heart
Only this song and lyrics
For you for you for you for you

Sing this song for you Tonight
So I can approach your love

My love is only this
But my heart won't change, only for you baby
Even if my love is only this
I'll become your umbrella in the rain
I'll protect you on all your days",2,2021-06-30T09:10:19Z

@hxxixx,"세븐틴 얼굴에 집중 되고 풍경에 집중 돼서 가사는 잘 못들었는데 세 번째 들었을 때 참 슬픈 가사라는 걸 깨달았다. 나의 사랑이 이것 밖에 안 되는데 곁에 있어줘서 고맙다는 말에 나도 모르게 울컥했다. 이렇게 보면 참 가사 잘 지었다 생각 됨... 끝에 baby 라고 하는게 더 슬프다... 가사대로 상황을 상상해보니 생각하는 것보다 더 슬픈 것 같음... 세븐틴 좋아한지 얼마 안 됐는데 대부분의 멤버들이 노래도 부르고 랩도 하는 모습에 얼마나 놀랐는지... 랩하고 노래 하는 것도 대단한데 이런 슬픈 노래에 감정을 실어주어서 너무 대단하다고 생각했다. 세븐틴 영상의 어느 한 댓글을 본 적이 있는데 세븐틴 노래는 마치 뮤지컬 같다는 댓글이었다. 이번에 나온 타이틀 곡 ready to love도 뮤지컬 같은 곡이어서 매일 아침마다 틀고 외출 준비하는 건 안 비밀😅 마음 같아선 평생 세븐틴으로 살아달라고 하고 싶다. 

세븐틴은 최애 차애 이런 걸 정할 수가 없을만큼 13명 모두 각자의 매력이 넘쳐흐른다. 인생을 길게 살진 않았지만 아마 내 인생에서 가장 최고의 아이돌이라고 생각한다. 내가 늙어서도 세븐틴은 꼭 기억하고 싶다.

I couldn't hear the lyrics well because I was focused on SEVENTEEN's face and focused on the scenery, but when I listened to it for the third time, I realized that the lyrics were really sad. This is the only love I have, but when I said thank you for being by my side, I cried without knowing it. Looking at it like this, I think the lyrics are really well written... It's sadder to say baby at the end... When I imagine the situation according to the lyrics, it's sadder than I thought... It's been a while since I've liked Seventeen, but most of the members also sing I was amazed at how much he rapping... It's great to rap and sing, but I thought it was great because he put emotion into such a sad song. I saw a comment on a Seventeen video, and it was a comment that Seventeen's song is like a musical. The title song ""Ready to Love"" released this time is also like a musical, so it's no secret to play it every morning and prepare to go out 😅 I think I want to live as Seventeen for the rest of my life. Seventeen is so overflowing with their own charms that it is impossible to decide on such a thing as a favorite Cha-ae. I didn't have a long life, but I think he's probably the best idol in my life. Even when I grow old, I want to remember Seventeen.",8,2021-06-25T13:47:21Z

They convey their songs together with their feelings.
Either good or bad, it is their emotions that filled the songs while they are singing.

Seventeen is not just idols but artists.
They used their talents not just to boast but to inspired people who are in need of comfort.

안녕, 나의 기쁨이여
깊은 절망에도 
항상 웃게 해 By my side
잠시 모든 걸 잊게 해 줘
아는 노랠 틀고 One step
두 손을 잡고 발을 Two step
어느새 오늘의 나에게
내일의 널 바라게 해
Baby It's alright
Oh It's okay
내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라, O ah 더 고마워
가끔은 지쳐
고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때 
어쩔 줄 모르는 난 뭘 할 수 있을까
정말 미안해
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 고마워 My baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해
쏟아지는 유성우처럼
까만 하늘에 빛이 돼 줘
I can do everything for you
난 너에게
뭐든지 다 주고 싶은 마음만 커서
작아지는 나는 받기만 하는 바보
어느새 내가 미워서
너에게 더욱 미안해

Oh It's okay
내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라, O ah 더 고마워 
가끔은 지쳐

정말 미안해
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 고마워 My baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해
어렵게 내 마음 적은
이 노래와 가사뿐이지만
For you for you for you for you
이 노랜 널 위해 불러 Tonight
네 사랑에 다가갈 수 있게
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 마음은 변치 않아 너에게만 Baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
비 내리는 너의 우산이 돼 줄게
지켜줄게 너의 모든 날에",219,2021-06-24T07:44:53Z

@nahomranan5448,"I wish all carats realize this was meant as a gift for US. They didn't have to make this special version in the middle of their hectic schedule, but they did as a gift for their 6th anniversary. Many carats were disappointed & complained bc of the lack of content similar to last year or 2019's, but the fact that they prepared this screams a lot. I really do believe SEVENTEEN cherishes their fans in a unique way, i wished carats did too.",1037,2021-06-22T08:07:05Z

@lunebleue3391,Tbh their studio version doesn't do justice to their live vocals. SVT is that very few groups that has a stable vocal even during hardcore choreography. And YES i never saw SVT perform while lipsinging. You can hear their backup vocals but they making sure their mic are louder A TOTAL CHEFS KISS!!!,1,2021-06-22T04:39:16Z

@aspxryn,"Funny how it's always: ""Carats are spoiled from love. You guys are so lucky"" because we receive gifts like these but little did they know that we're luckier to have seventeen because in every release that they do, it's dedicated fo us. I hope this will become another motivation for you when you're feeling discouraged. I believe in us, we believe in them, and they believe in us too. Let's break our own goals and records.

내 사랑은 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼


안녕, 나의 기쁨이여
깊은 절망에도
항상 웃게 해 by my side
잠시 모든 걸 잊게 해 줘

아는 노랠 틀고 one step
두 손을 잡고 발을 two step
어느새 오늘의 나에게
내일의 널 바라게 해

Baby it's alright
Oh it's okay

내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라, oh ah 더 고마워

가끔은 지쳐
고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때
어쩔 줄 모르는 난 뭘 할 수 있을까
정말 미안해

내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 
고마워 my baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해

쏟아지는 유성우처럼
까만 하늘에 빛이 돼 줘
I can do everything for you
난 너에게

뭐든지 다 주고 싶은 마음만 커서
작아지는 나는 받기만 하는 바보
어느새 내가 미워서
너에게 더욱 미안해

Baby it's alright
Oh it's okay

내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라, oh ah 더 고마워

가끔은 지쳐
고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때
어쩔 줄 모르는 난 뭘 할 수 있을까
정말 미안해

내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 
고마워 my baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해

어렵게 내 마음 적은
이 노래와 가사뿐이지만
For you, for you, for you, for you

이 노랜 널 위해 불러 tonight
네 사랑에 다가갈 수 있게

내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 마음은 변치 않아 
너에게만 baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
비 내리는 너의 우산이 돼 줄게
지켜줄게 너의 모든 날에

"" HAHAHAHA, but anyways I REALLY LOVE THIS VERSION, I'm just smiling through the whole video, especially when I saw dino dunno why, and yes I love this song, but to be honest , I didn't like the mixing of their studio version, so I thought that maybe it was intentional for something coming, and here we are, just them, not dissapointing us, for all these years they are always like this, but yeah thank you for all, as always we love you, you love us, and as always we will support you.

I'm out of words but...

HAPPY 6TH YEAR IN THE INDUSTRY. 



But yeah I just wanna add this, because I don't want to waste this opportunity to say how much jisoo improved in singing, he was a good vocalist yeah it's given, but through years of improving, THIS IS HIS GLOW UP,  His voice got clearer and the control was on point, and now he got the full confidence on showing his abilities, I'm just proud, just me being teary, this is what he deserved, I'M JUST HAPPY FOR HIM, MAYBE JISOO YOU'LL READ THIS OR NOT, BUT CONGRATULATIONS TO YOUR IMPROVEMENT, I'M ALWAYS PROUD OF YOU, AND US CARATS WE WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU, LIKE LOOK, YOU ARE REALLY SHINING IN THIS VIDEO, I LOVE YOU, AND TO ALL OF THE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THIS FOR THE ARRANGEMENT, BAND, AND EVERYONE BEHIND THIS, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING THIS SONG ALIVE (NOT ALIKE FROMM STUDIO VER.

Wonwoo’s “not from paris madame” in tiny, Joshua’s literal “t-shirt” printed shirt, Vernon’s shirt over the tee, Jeonghan’s medium sleeves for some reason, Minghao’s loosen button up with the pale bandana tied, Mingyu’s typography looking like those from a magazine, Hoshi’s “Move me” print, Jun’s opened up shirt with medium short sleeves, Woozi’s button up with the sleeves cuffed, Cheol’s front pocket attached with blue cursive writing, Seungkwan’s button up with an undone bowtie I believe, Dk ACTUALLY using a plain t-shirt and Dino with a sort of company logo?

@KennieKemala,"Hello seventeen and carat,

I know it's already passed May 26 and i guess it's never too late to pour my feelings toward our 6 year journey

It was not short, honestly it was long journey. I almost have seen all the ups and downs we've been through. Being each other strength for 6 years it was never been easy and it's overwhelming that our feeling towards each other still firmly stay the same, like i can't believe it you trust me as much as i do, you love me as much as i do.

Words never been enough to say everything that i feel towards you guys really..i just conclude all these feelings for you guys with my sincere gratitude, i hope you understand that i can't give you any materialistic things but i hope my gratitude could touch your heart so you guys could atleast feel ease and warm.

Once again, happy birthday :)",2,2021-05-29T23:55:59Z

@takemesohigh,"For all years that I’ve been a kpop fan, Seventeen is the only group that gives so much more to their beloved fans. I feel like they are giving more than what they receive and I’m (well partially bec of some stuffs) happy with their management bec they are allowed to do this because for all we know, some idols were not given a chance for such acts. Also, Seventeen and Carats representation to me are like storm. Everything surrounding them are so chaotic but on the inside, the bond bet. SVT and Carat are warm and peaceful (and ofc savage for some haha). Thank you, Seventeen members for being you! Happy anniversary!!",2,2021-05-29T14:37:41Z

내 사랑은 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼

안녕, 나의 기쁨이여
깊은 절망에도
항상 웃게 해 by my side
잠시 모든 걸 잊게 해 줘

아는 노랠 틀고 one step
두 손을 잡고 발을 two step
어느새 오늘의 나에게
내일의 널 바라게 해

Baby it's alright
Oh it's okay

내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라, oh ah 더 고마워

가끔은 지쳐
고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때
어쩔 줄 모르는 난 뭘 할 수 있을까
정말 미안해

내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 고마워 my baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해

쏟아지는 유성우처럼
까만 하늘에 빛이 돼 줘
I can do everything for you
난 너에게

뭐든지 다 주고 싶은 마음만 커서
작아지는 나는 받기만 하는 바보
어느새 내가 미워서
너에게 더욱 미안해

Baby it's alright
Oh it's okay

내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라, oh ah 더 고마워

가끔은 지쳐
고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때
어쩔 줄 모르는 난 뭘 할 수 있을까
정말 미안해

그래도 내 곁에 있어…",0,2021-05-29T02:59:36Z

I stanned them in early 2016 and its shocking seeing how time flies so fast, i was just 14 then and now this year i will be 20, they were my silent support many times, i though i was weird for relying on idols whom maybe i will never meet but seeing the fandom and experimenting this kindness from the group and its fans, it stands to me the reason why seventeen is so well loved and admired.

@huangrenjunism,"forgive me for this cheesy and mildly cringe long essay comment in advance lol. but svt deserves it <3

so i was gonna write a really long comment of how much i'm proud of seventeen, how much i love and adore them, how much i want to support them, and how their journey to come where they are will never cease to impress me and make me emotional. but i can't even put it into words, which may sound a bit cheesy lol, so i'm just gonna wing it.
seventeen has always felt like a place to call home, even though they are just thirteen people across the world on the internet. but somehow they have succeeded into bringing so many different and beautiful types of people together and giving them a makeshift home. even when i don't watch svt content/music for awhile, i can always come back to them and immediately feel endless amounts of warmth and love that brings such a large amount of happiness. they love us so much and we love them back, but they have also taught us to not rely on them. they have taught us to love others and ourselves and to not make them the center of lives. they make me, and i'm sure many other people, appreciate the people and things around me, and i genuinely adore them for that. i don't think i could ever express how amazed i am by the endless amounts of love and talent they have. i guess you could say their power of love is truly astonishing *wink wink* (sorry to anyone who read that lmfao)

@blackplasticbagandgraytowe9169,"Seventeen,, 13 angels,, stanning them is the best decision in my life.

I have been stanning them since 2018, after they release 'Thanks' song. I really can't describe how precious that song bringing me into diamond life. 

After listening to that song ,, I start listen to their song since debut to learn all things about them.

Yeah, they songs really... I can't describe how much beautiful their song are.. Not just one, two or three of their songs,, I'm telling you the truth, *all of their songs* .

Since that time,, my life become happier than before. I really can't tell you how much I feel grateful to have them in my life. 

That year,, 2018,, I feel that year really worst year for me. Being compared to other student, being push to study hard for exam, I really feel down when I'm not doing my best in exam because I'm scared to make mistake. Really,, I really hate myself that time. 

But,, since I start stanning them,, I found my inspiration to be my own self and don't care to what other people are saying to me. Even my parents always comparing me to my classmate.

But, I'm glad, Seventeen was coming into my life.

They are everything for me since that time.

Trust me, you won't regret stanning them.

내 사랑은 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼

안녕, 나의 기쁨이여
깊은 절망에도
항상 웃게 해 by my side
잠시 모든 걸 잊게 해 줘

아는 노랠 틀고 one step
두 손을 잡고 발을 two step
어느새 오늘의 나에게
내일의 널 바라게 해

Baby it's alright
Oh it's okay

내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라, oh ah 더 고마워

가끔은 지쳐
고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때
어쩔 줄 모르는 난 뭘 할 수 있을까
정말 미안해

내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 고마워 my baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해

쏟아지는 유성우처럼
까만 하늘에 빛이 돼 줘
I can do everything for you
난 너에게

뭐든지 다 주고 싶은 마음만 커서
작아지는 나는 받기만 하는 바보
어느새 내가 미워서
너에게 더욱 미안해

Baby it's alright
Oh it's okay

내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라, oh ah 더 고마워

가끔은 지쳐
고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때
어쩔 줄 모르는 난 뭘 할 수 있을까
정말 미안해

내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 고마워 my baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해

어렵게 내 마음 적은
이 노래와 가사뿐이지만
For you, for you, for you, for you

이 노랜 널 위해 불러 tonight
네 사랑에 다가갈 수 있게

내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 마음은 변치 않아 너에게만 baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
비 내리는 너의 우산이 돼 줄게
지켜줄게 너의 모든 날에",3,2021-05-28T17:02:32Z

Your songs provide me so much strength and a sense of safety. Every video I have watched of you guys has given me so much laughter, so much joy, inspiration and soooooo much love. I have never fallen for any artist this fast before. It really is overwhelming. But you make me genuinely happy. I will never regret loving seventeen. I promise that I will be here for a very very long time to come. Till the last say the name, and even after that, all 13 members will forever have their own little place in my heart. Thank you so much, for just being you. Next year, for the 7th anniversary, I will be even for grateful for all the love you have given me, for all the times you made me laugh, for all the times you were there with me when i was crying, for every lesson I learnt from you.

[Korean]
내 사랑은 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼

안녕, 나의 기쁨이여
깊은 절망에도
항상 웃게 해 By my side
잠시 모든 걸 잊게 해 줘

아는 노랠 틀고 One step
두 손을 잡고 발을 Two step
어느새 오늘의 나에게
내일의 널 바라게 해

Baby It's alright
Oh It's okay

내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라, O ah 더 고마워

가끔은 지쳐
고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때
어쩔 줄 모르는 난 뭘 할 수 있을까
정말 미안해

내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서
고마워 My baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해

쏟아지는 유성우처럼
까만 하늘에 빛이 돼 줘
I can do everything for you
난 너에게

뭐든지 다 주고 싶은 마음만 커서
작아지는 나는 받기만 하는 바보
어느새 내가 미워서
너에게 더욱 미안해

고마워 My baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해

어렵게 내 마음 적은
이 노래와 가사뿐이지만
For you for you for you for you

이 노랜 널 위해 불러 Tonight
네 사랑에 다가갈 수 있게

내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 마음은 변치 않아
너에게만 Baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도

It was November 2019, i found you and i was just ignoring Don't Wanna Cry and just love it as a song. It was my hard time as a teenager, I was about to giving up. I don't care anything about my life anymore.
But then your songs keep show up in my youtube, like it was a fate. I don't know why i clicked all of those vids, you guys slowly encourage me up, i also gradually get my smile back. 
I don't know what would happen to me if I didn't find seventeen that day. until now, December 24th 2019 has been a special day for me, you saved me Seventeen. 💎❤️",1,2021-05-28T07:21:53Z

a pesar de que no los staneo desde hace tiempo estoy feliz de estar en su 6to aniversario
y espero estar en todos los que faltan realmente espero que estén cuidando su salud a pesar de su agitadas agendas, ya que todo Carat espera que se encuentren bien.

@Jiuscrochetcorner,"I’ve been a fan of seventeen since pre debut and honestly they are one of the reasons I fell deep into kpop, their talent, their vocals, their hardwork and strength, and everything about their efforts and teamwork to create beautiful and meaningful music. I absolutely loved them when they debuted and it’s absolutely amazing to see how much they’ve grown musically. There were times over the years where I’d stray from Kpop but I’d always come back to seventeen whenever there was a comeback. Their music feels like home, that sweet nostalgia of youth and teenage dream. It’s incredible how music can move us. Thank you Seventeen!!! Happy 6th anniversary!!!!",57,2021-05-28T04:28:41Z

@neubulla,"Been knowing them since 2013 which means I already spent like third of my life to know them. My precious idol, Seventeen, who still stay humble though they already have the world on their hand, your road is still long. There would be more and more difficulties in the future but I'm sure you guys can get through of it. Other than you have each other, you have us, Carats, by your side. Just like us have you by our side. Happy 6th anniversary! It's not easy to stay this long but I still want us to have 7th, 8th, even 50th anniversary together. Your song and existence helped a lot of people during their hardest time, including me. Thank you for always giving your best for us, to make our day, to be our healing and family. I love you guys so much!♡",26,2021-05-28T00:18:21Z

It really just goes to show no matter where you're from, what your mother language is, if you're an introvert or extrovert, if you believe within yourself and never give up on your dreams you can make it. 
Happy 6 years Seventeen!                                  To all Carats, no matter where we are from, what gender we identify as, if we are introverted or extroverted, our past and our struggles, we are here today.  We may not all know each other personally but every single one of us together makes our fandom what it is. I am so proud to say that i am a Carat and to be apart of this beautiful fandom.

@cabs1504,"Hola... ha rondando un poco la información hacerca del cambio de seventeen en Japón, sus asociaciones y/o comunicaciones cambiaran, muchos culpan a hybe por esto... Pero el tema esta muy tapado por parte de pledis y hybe.... Se relaciona el caso con el de gfriend por su desactivacion como idols siguiendo cierto patrón, como la disminución de contenido en Japón 🇯🇵, sus comebacks, sus vlives, sus fancafes, al cumplir 6 años como grupo su contrato acaba pero no lo renuevan, el GoSe retrasado etc..... Algunxs carats llegaron a la conclusión de que seventeen esta siendo poco a poco desaparecido por estas dos empresas.... Ademas hybe vende sus productos y merch  casi obligando a carat a comprarlos.... Las el contenido de seventeen a venido cambiando dando a conocer que hybe le exige cambiarlo (sus colores oficiales en merch y la hora de GoSe) .... Esperamos que nuestros carats se hagan escuchar para que este tema no llegue a afectar futuramente a seventeen y solo sean pequeños cambios que hace hybe para ""mejorar"" a seventeen

My love only amounts to this
 
Hello, my joy
Even in my deep despairs
You always make me smile by my side
It makes me momentarily forget about everything
 
Turn on a song we know and take one step
We hold hands and our feet move two step
Before I know it
You make today’s me look forward to tomorrow’s you
 
Baby it’s alright
Oh it’s okay
 
Because it’s only you who knows all my lies
O ah I’m more thankful
 
When I often see you tired with your head down
Me, who doesn’t know what to do
What can I possibly do?
I’m sincerely sorry
 
My love only amounts to this
But thank you for staying by my side my baby
Even if my love only amounts to this
I’ll be your spring during any winter
My heart can only say these words
 
Like a meteor shower
Be a light in the dark sky
I can do everything for you
I only have a big heart that wants to give you everything
 
Me, who has become pathetic
I’m a fool who only receives
At some point, I started hating myself
I’m even more apologetic towards you
 
Baby it’s alright
Oh it’s okay
 
Because it’s only you who knows all my lies
O ah I’m more thankful
 
When I often see you tired with your head down
Me, who doesn’t know what to do
What can I possibly do?
I’m sincerely sorry
 
My love only amounts to this
But thank you for staying by my side my baby
Even if my love only amounts to this
I’ll be your spring during any winter
My heart can only say these words
 
Although it’s just this song and lyrics,
Which contain my feelings that I wrote down with difficulty
For you, for you, for you, for you
 
I sing this song for you tonight
So that I can get closer to your love

My love only amounts to this
But my heart won’t change it’s only for you baby
Even if my love only amounts to this
I’ll be your umbrella when it rains
I’ll protect you throughout all your days",119,2021-05-27T18:00:09Z

@dindaseptiara5393,"congratulations, we succeeded to reach 6 years together. looking back to old days, it feels like miracle how a ""nugu"" could top the big three. for a group that coming from almost bankrupt agency, that certainly wasn't a smooth journey at all--you guys poured tears and bloods into it, I know that.

I remember Seungcheol said that he lost his counts and always wonder when will the debut happen. I remember how Jeonghan stuttered when MC-ing a music show. I remember Jisoo used to be an underdog member and people barely recognize him. I remember Junhui and his confident ass left his hometown just to be a singer and gets only 2 lines in a song. I remember Soonyoung smiled towards the screen when you guys having a debut showcase and only some people stopped to watch you perform. I remember Wonwoo and his underground rapper hairstyle that I used to mock because you'd do as well if only you saw his pics. I remember the way Jihoon couldn't stop crying when you guys won the music champ for the first time. I remember Seokmin snotted his nose out because the judge said he wasn't really qualified for a main vocalist. I remember Mingyu came to the audition wearing a pair of slipper. I remember Minghao used to cry himself to sleep because he was a new kid and barely understand Korean. I remember Seungkwan promoted Jeju better than SK government ever did--he still does, though. I remember Hansol was shorter than Jisoo and also his gold quote. I remember Chan who's maknae but feels more like hyung than the rest of them. thirteen of you grew like big, nice sunflower. that damn green cubicle basement wasn't there to witness nothing.

thank you for all these years, you guys always accompany me in my ups and downs. your music made me realize that we can always see the beauty through the worst things, some of your lyrics made me grow as a human. thanks to those imaginary support when I feel like no one would understand.

happy 6th anniversary, let's stay together for longer💙

@drjeonwonwoo4996,"This 6 years feels so fast. At first, i got to know them bcus my bias was Cheollie when he's still Pledis Boys with Nuest. Knowing he not passing to debut with Nuest breaks my heart but I still follow him and discovers these gems. They were rough at first and now they're the shiniest diamonds. Following them since trainee days and crying when they announced their debut date (ancient carats knew the hard days they went through). Since I am the same age with 95 liners, feels their journey is also mine. They taught me loving myself, loving people around me and to give back what I've gained. Currently, my bias is Wonwoo and my bias list being wrecked so many times with no regrets. Crying when they won their first music show, crying when they announced our name is Carat, crying whenever they did something out of love for Carats. 
Till the last 'Say The Name'",64,2021-05-27T14:43:09Z
@berrypeach1012,"Seventeen always feels like home. A wonderful place you can go back whenever you're feeling down. A place where you can share your laughter and tears... A place where you can feel that you can love yourself.

well, this is how I feel... I found them during the time I was very sad and confused back in 2013. It's nice to see how the young boys I was only watching on the green room is now one of the most respected groups in Kpop.
It's been so long, and they still feel like home... listening to their comforting words and songs...
I know seventeen will never know how much they helped me on my journey of loving myself. But I would like to say thank you for everything... It's been so long, and my feelings may not be as intense as when I started back then, but my love, trust, and respect for this men still remain the same.
I sometimes feel like a proud mom even tho I only have the same age as the 97line ㅋㅋ
But really... Thank you for always sharing such wonderful songs. Your songs keep me going everyday... Happy 6th Anniversary of your debut!

I hope the best for SEVENTEEN and to all CARATs who are supporting them in a positive way. New and Old fans, we are a family that love the same people.
Let's all continue to be the fans Seventeen can be proud of ♡",399,2021-05-27T14:42:15Z

Nasa highschool pa lang ako at trainees pa lang kayo noon, ngayon graduate na ako ng college at kayo naman nag-celebrate ng 6 years anniversary 😭 Hindi ko din alam pero iba kasi kayo sa lahat ng grupo na inistan ko. Sainyo ko lang kasi talaga na-feel yung genuine na pagpapahalaga talaga sa mga fans. At sobranggg solid niyo kasi. Iba yung samahan niyo sa lahat ng grupo na inistan ko. Sobrang totoo at sweet niyo sa isa't isa ang sarap niyo panuorin nakakawala ng lungkot, nakakataba pa ng puso. 😭 Iba din kasi talaga talento niyo, sobrang ang sarap ipagmalaki na kayo ang idols ko. Maraming salamat sa anim na taon ng pagpapasaya at pagbibigay ng magagandang kanta saakin, saamin. Maaasahan niyong hanggang dulo, kahit maputi na mga buhok niyo, natin.

Woozi: My love only amounts to this.... 

Jeonghan: Hi, my joy 
Even in my deep despairs 
You always make me smile by my side 
It makes me momentarily forget about everything 

Vernon: Turn on a song we know and take one step 
We hold hands and our feet [move] two step 

Wonwoo: Before I know it 
You make today’s me look forward to tomorrow’s you 

Joshua: Baby it’s alright Oh it’s okay 
Because it’s only you who knows all my lies
O ah I’m more thankful 

Hoshi: When I often see you tired with your head down 
Me, who doesn’t know what to do 
What can I possibly do?...

Jun: I’m sincerely sorry 

Dino: My love only amounts to this 
But thank you for staying by my side 
My baby 

DK: Even if my love only amounts to this 

SCoups: I’ll be your spring during any winter 
My heart can only say these words 

Wonwoo: Like a meteor shower 
Be a light in the dark sky 

Seungkwan: I can do everything for you 

Mingyu: I have a big heart that wants to give you everything 
Me, who has become pathetic 
I’m a fool who only receives 

SCoups: At some point, I started hating myself 
I’m even more sorry for you.

Woozi: Baby it’s alright Oh it’s okay 
Because it’s only you who knows all my lies O ah 
I’m more thankful 

The8: When I often see you tired with your head down 
Me, who doesn’t know what to do 
What can I possibly do? 

Hoshi: I’m sincerely sorry 

DK: My love only amounts to this 
But thank you for staying by my side 
My baby 

Mingyu: Even if my love only amounts to this 

Vernon: I’ll be your spring during any winter 

Dino: My heart can only say these words 
Although it’s just this song and lyrics 
Which contain my feelings that I wrote down with difficulty 

Woozi & DK: For you for you for you for you .....

Seungkwan: I sing this song for you tonight 
So that I can get closer to your love...

Joshua: My love only amounts to this 
But my heart won’t change It’s only for you baby 

Jun: Even if my love only amounts to this 
I’ll be your umbrella when it rains 

Jeonghan: I’ll protect you throughout all your days...",22,2021-05-27T12:15:22Z

@caratyooniverse4533,"The fact that they kept on saying that they'll improve so that no one can say anything bad about us and that we can proudly say that we are a carat hits so different. Like the love isnt one-sided at all. They love us as much as we love them but what makes it more beautiful is that there is still this boundary that they have set y'know? Just like what minghao kept on saying that we shouldn't supposed to be making them as a center of our lives and that instead of treating them as a significant other we can treat them as an inspiration. After all he accepts that not all of us will stay until thr very end. And that all of this might just be a phase but they are still thankful bc they were once part of our youth.

During in-complete concert cheol said something like it is their responsibility to overturn what other people could say about us being a fan. Because as we all know some people would really think that we are crazy or would think badly about us for being a fan. Sometimes calling us obsessed, immature. But hearing these kind of words from them and assuring us as if they 'got us' means so freaking special to me as a fan😭

You know, that's just so beautiful. The way they value the  people who loves and support them is just out of this world and too good to be true but it actually is!! And I'm so happy to have them as my idols.",1884,2021-05-27T12:03:36Z

안녕, 나의 기쁨이여
깊은 절망에도
항상 웃게 해 by my side
잠시 모든 걸 잊게 해 줘

아는 노랠 틀고 one step
두 손을 잡고 발을 two step
어느새 오늘의 나에게
내일의 널 바라게 해

Baby it's alright
Oh it's okay

내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라, oh ah 더 고마워

가끔은 지쳐
고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때
어쩔 줄 모르는 난 뭘 할 수 있을까
정말 미안해

내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 고마워 my baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해

쏟아지는 유성우처럼
까만 하늘에 빛이 돼 줘
I can do everything for you
난 너에게

뭐든지 다 주고 싶은 마음만 커서
작아지는 나는 받기만 하는 바보
어느새 내가 미워서
너에게 더욱 미안해

Baby it's alright
Oh it's okay

내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라, oh ah 더 고마워

가끔은 지쳐
고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때
어쩔 줄 모르는 난 뭘 할 수 있을까
정말 미안해

내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 고마워 my baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해

어렵게 내 마음 적은
이 노래와 가사뿐이지만
For you, for you, for you, for you

이 노랜 널 위해 불러 tonight
네 사랑에 다가갈 수 있게

내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 마음은 변치 않아 너에게만 baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
비 내리는 너의 우산이 돼 줄게
지켜줄게 너의 모든 날에",2,2021-05-27T07:44:56Z

@hoshihater3907,"En el transcurso del día vi el video 4 veces y esta última fue la única en que no tuve lágrimas en los ojos, sino una enorme sonrisa no de risa como me la suelen robar cada miércoles regular, no melancólica cada que veo videos predebut. No. Era una sonrisa de orgullo, alegría y agradecimiento.
SEVENTEEN ha luchado tanto para darnos todo de ellos no solo por 6 años, sino desde que iniciaron su entrenamiento y no puedo estar más orgullosa de la forma en que se muestran a nosotros, el cómo se hacen escuchar.
SEVENTEEN me hace feliz no solo por lo que me dan con su talento sino con su persona, el cómo son buenos hijos, hermanos, sunbaes y, sobre todo, amigos.
SEVENTEEN merece mucho y les agradezco sinceramente por ser un ejemplo a seguir y por no haberse rendido. 

Sí. Con la cabeza en alto confieso ser CARAT, seguidora de estas 13 maravillosas estrellas que hoy cumplen 6 años de su primer paso en el inmenso cielo !!!

@sittizaenab4048,"Pengen share ini,
Aku tahu mereka dari akhir 2018,
Awalnya iseng cari diyoutube, list lagu2 populer kpop dan yang muncul sebuah channel aku lupa apa dan muncul 1 lagu dari seventeen "" thanks ""
Denger lagunya itu keren kemudian aku cari lagunya digoogle dan ke dow nload. "" thanks "" selalu kuputar dan penasaran ini seventeen siapa2 aja dan gimana dancenya. Serius keren dan menyentuh banget padahal itu belum tahu artinya pertama nonton lagu ini di salah satu channel music show kpop. 

Nah penasaran lah saya sama mereka lagi dengan cari2 single mereka, download dan dengerin, smuanya keren.
Terus kuputuskan untuk mengenal lagi mereka dengan nonton idol room,reality show mereka yang dipulau yoesodo dan yg di Jepang. Jadi suka sama mereka. Ini ditahun 2019. Kemudian nonton video2 mereka yg going seventeen versi dulunya mereka sampe sekarang.
Itu berlanjut sampai tahun 2020. Ditahun ini,  aku mulai ngikutin mereka baik-baik dengan follow semua sosmednya seventeen. sampe download vlive hanya untuk lihat mereka. Follow akun fan Indonesia di telegram buat tahu info weverse mereka krn aku ngak bisa punya itu.
Hingga sekarang. Aku udah cinta sama mereka. Aku emang suka kpop tapi bukan tipe nge stan bucin gitu2, ngak.cm skdar suka. Dari semuanya, cuma SEVENTEEN yang buat hatiku nyaman dan memutuskan buat sayang, cinta dan respect sm mereka sampai sekarang.
Mereka adalah mood booster bangetttt... 
 
Lagu ini betul2 ngungkapin perasaan mereka ke carat. Dan aku ngerasain pesan mereka. Bersyukur banget. 
T

Terima kasih kalian,
Semoga kalian sehat2, tetap semangat, menjadi pribadi yg lebih baik untuk diri kaliam sendiri, keluarga, teman2, dan fans kalian, carat.
Kami, carat, selalu mendukung kalian, 
Kami bangga punya kalian, SEVENTEEN

@amethystcorsage8409,"Hello, this is my Love Letter for you. 

Here I want to tell you the story when I'm Falling for You guys. When the very first time you guys Come To Me, my life was so dark. I'm at the worst time (until now btw). I have to deal it with my Trauma. Fear is the one I should deal with every day. But since I know you guys for the past 7 months, whenever I'm tired I always Run to You. U guys such a Healing for me. Besides my 'dark' life whenever I see you I feel like I have a Second Life. 

My first era was Home;Run. I was clueless back then since you're 13 members and I was tired to remember all of you. So I tried again with your Q&A content on Youtube. I Don't Know why but the more I watch the more I want to know. So, since that day I became a CARAT and watch all your contents. 

From now on, I always Thinking About You for 247 in my life (I swear!). I really Adore U guys so much. The way you write your Hit Song (all of your songs is just a hit song for me), the way you build your relationship with everyone, the positive vibe that you always show us. Keep up Bring It. You're really Good to Me ay ay ay. 

Guys I really wanna say Thanks for being my Home. If I have a chance I really want to Hug all of you, showing how grateful I am for slipping into this diamond life. At this specific time  you're already become the Highlight of my life. I Wish we Can't See The End of our journey bcs we will always Together forever. If only the end is coming hopefully it would be a Happy Ending. 

I'm tearing up right now ㅠ but I Don't Wanna Cry
All My Love just for you
I do Crazy in Love with all of you
아주 Nice to know you 
I'm so lucky for having you
Once again, Let Me Hear You Say
SAY THE NAME! 


Thank you for being born SEVENTEEN ✨💎

@nurrizkaalfirahusna9647,"Sebagai penikmat lagu K-Pop sejak 2015, aku udah biasa denger lagu berbagai girl group atau boy grup. Awal tahu Seventeen dari lagu Mansae mereka, dan sejak itu selalu ngikutin comeback mereka tapi ga bener2 sesuka itu sama mereka. Sebatas menikmati semua lagu dan video dance mereka karena mereka sangat berbakat. Baru tahun kemarin, aku kayak bener2 sayang sama mereka bertiga belas. Rasanya agak menyesal kenapa ga dari dulu, dari awal dengar lagu mereka, aku mulai serius memperhatikan mereka.

Jujur. semua lagu seventeen ga ada yang gagal. Terima kasih atas lagu-lagu indahnya. Lagu-lagu Seventeen ini adalah teman yang menemaniku mengerjakan tugas selama ini. Dan kalau disuruh lagu apa yang membuat aku bisa menitikkan air mata sebelum tahu artinya, lagu ini adalah salah satunya. Apalagi pas tahu artinya, makin ambyar. 

Sekali lagi, Terima kasih banyak Seventeen.",1,2021-05-27T05:53:16Z

With time I got better, became busy with life and there are times where i may not see a lot of them (thought i keep up with their comebacks and gose) but every now and then i watch videos and stuff and the feeling i get its just magical, not other artist ever made me feel like they do. I love seeing them grow, how they keep on getting better musically and still being the most amazing beautiful human beings.

Hello my joy
Even in deep despair
Always make me laugh By my side
Let me forget everything for a moment

Play a song you know and one step
Hold your hands and put your feet in two steps
To me today
I make you wish for tomorrow

Baby It's alright
Oh It's okay

Knowing all my lies
It's just you, O ah, thank you more

Sometimes tired
When I see you crying with my head down
I don't know what to do, what can I do
I'm really sorry

My love is only this
Thanks for staying by my side though, my baby
Even if my love is only this
Any winter, it will be your spring
My heart barely says this

Like a pouring meteor shower
Be a light in the black sky
I can do everything for you
I am to you

I only want to givе anything and everything
I'm getting smallеr, a fool who only accepts
I hate myself
I'm even more sorry for you

Baby It's alright
Oh It's okay

Knowing all my lies
It's just you, O ah, thank you more

Sometimes tired
When I see you crying with my head down
I don't know what to do, what can I do
I'm really sorry

My love is only this
Thanks for staying by my side though, my baby
Even if my love is only this
Any winter, it will be your spring
My heart barely says this

Hardly my heart
Only this song and lyrics
For you for you for you for you

Sing this song for you Tonight
So I can approach your love

My love is only this
But my heart won't change, only for you baby
Even if my love is only this
I'll become your umbrella in the rain
I'll protect you on all your days

I might not always be there for you... But you guys... Your music, its always there to cheer me up when I'm sad, always comfort me when I need to be comforted, always filling me up when I feel empty, and of course you guys are always there when I'm happy. I would like to thank you guys for that.

This past 6 years must not be that easy, right?
But thank you, for not giving up on music.
Thank you, for standing tall through all the hard times you must've been.
Thank you, for not giving up to see us, CARATS. Especially to see us happy.
Thank you, for all of your hard work. You always nailed it, guys.
Thank you, for being the most amazing group that we all known: SEVENTEEN!

On this beautiful 6th anniversary, let's mark it with all of our love, joy, and happines!!
I will always look up to you, boys.
Always.

See you on your 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and infinity anniversary because we know... Even if our youth is over, even if we have to go on our own journey, but we will always have each other. 
We will always belong to each other. 
So don't worry, no one will get left behind and feel lonely, because we are always one <333

@adlynnnn,"Bukan Carat, tapi akhir akhir ini aku mengalihkan pikiran dengan nonton Going Seventeen. Sejauh ini, cuma svt yang content nya beneran terlihat senatural itu. Friendship dan kekeluargaan svt dan staff bener bener bisa diliat disana. 

Sebagai self-producing idol, svt bener bener pantas memegang predikat itu dan itu menginspirasi aku untuk berubah jadi lebih produktif lagi. 

Aku mau sekalian apresiasi lagu 태어나줘서 고마워... nggak pernah sebelumnya aku dengar lagu yang se-pure ini. Perasaan svt bener bener nyampe ke hati pendengarnya. Bener bener merasa dihargai dan disayangi.

@aliasfrmdn,"aku gatau harus pake kata apalagi buat ngegambarin rasa terima kasihku ke kalian secara singkat, padat, dan jelas. orang orang mungkin ngeliatnya kalian hanya boygroup kpop. tp buatku, kalian lebih dari itu.

..penyelamat? ya, penyelamat mungkin adalah kata yang paling bisa menjelaskan secara singkat, meskipun aku masih belum puas sama kata itu.

aku pernah ngerasa hilang. kaya ngga ada tujuan hidup. ngga tau apa yang mau aku lakuin besok, minggu depan, bulan depan, tahun depan, lima, delapan, atau bahkan 10 tahun ke depan. bahkan sampe berdoa kalo tuhan akan ambil nyawaku tiap kali aku tidur, dan terbangun dengan rasa kesal karena ngga dikabulin doaku itu. iya, seperti cuma melayang-layang aja di semesta; gaada gunanya, nyampah doang malah.

people asked me to love myself, but i also need something to push me so i can love myself. and im proud to say you're one of the reasons.

semua lagu kalian yang dibuat dengan hati sampai dengan selamat dan apik di hatiku. cara kalian perlakukan carat, meskipun bukan aku secara spesifik, bener-bener buatku yang cuma bisa ngeliat ngerasa.. nyaman. kalian pun enjoy ngejalaninnya meskipun kalo kata orang orang ""ini hanyalah pekerjaan mereka"".

dan dengan lagu ini, kalian menyampaikan permintaan maaf kalian karena kalian ""hanya bisa memberikan cinta sebesar ini"". aku gatau untuk carat lain, tapi buatku pribadi ini udah jauh dari kata cukup.

meskipun aku masih belum tau aku mau ngapain di masa depan nanti, seengganya sekarang aku ngga ngerasa kalo aku cuma melayang-layang kaya sampah di alam semesta ini. seengganya doa doaku untuk dicabut nyawanya ngga keluar dari bibir dan hatiku lagi. seengganya aku udah ngga merasa ""hilang"" sepenuhnya.

karena kalian. iya, kalian bertiga belas. seungcheol, jeonghan, joshua, junhui, soonyoung, wonwoo, jihoon, myeongho, mingyu, seokmin, seungkwan, hansol, chan, dan seventeen yang menyatukan kalian sampe detik ini, dan semoga sampai nanti juga.

aku mungkin cuma satu dari sekian juta banyaknya carat di dunia ini. mungkin kalian juga engga bakal baca ini karena keterbatasan bahasa. tapi makasih, banget. aku bersyukur tuhan ngga mengabulkan doaku waktu itu.

makasih banyak. makasih. makasih. 🤍💎",194,2021-05-27T02:53:19Z

@aqilastudio6848,"Aku baru stan Seventeen tahun ini,dulu MV DWC pernah muncul di beranda aku tapi aku ga nonton,karena dulu memang aku ga terlalu suka sama kpop,sampe waktu itu aku lagi scroll² instagram dan lihat video yang backsound nya lagu Hitorijanai,ternyata lagunya enaaaak bangeeet dari situ aku mulai suka sama Seventeen,tapi belum stan Seventeen,setelah itu aku dengerin lagu² Seventeen yang lainnya,kayak Fallin Flower,Oh My,dan Left & Right sebenarnya tahun lalu aku memang udah tau Seventeen,karena waktu itu aku nonton ""Acara Spesial Perayaan 300K Subscribers KBS World Indonesia Bagian 2/3"" lalu ada tebak²an lagu salah satu soalnya lagu Left & Right,karena aku penasaran aku cari aja di youtube lagu Left & Right,dari situ aku mulai tau Seventeen tapi waktu itu aku belum stan Seventeen,sekarang aku nyesel banget kenapa aku ga stan Seventeen dari dulu,sekarang aku dan adikku jadi carat,bias aku di Seventeen Wonwoo & Joshua klo adik aku S.Coups & Jun,sayang Seventeen banyak²❤️,semoga kedepannya kalian bisa lebih terkenal lagi karena lagu dan koreografi kalian sangat bagus dan memiliki arti yang bagus juga🤗❤️,kita akan selalu bersama walaupun nanti kalian menjalani wajib militer ataupun kontrak kalian selesai,aku berharap kalian akan memperpanjang kontrak kalian dengan pledis😁

@maygomez6001,"Hi Seventeen,

I am one of those fans  that you've saved from frustration and exhaustion from the quarantine life. Thank you for sharing your music to me. For giving me amazing contents, for making me feel loved and comforting me with your words, letters, and lyrics. You don't know how much that means to me. 

Your loved is overwhelming. I sometimes ask myself if you can also feel our love too. Am I  reciprocating your love enough? Am I taking you for granted? Are my  efforts enough to show you that I care? If I can, i want to give everything you deserves. 

I take pride of being a Carat. Imagine I am a fan of 13 amazing, talented, all rounder and well rounded artists. I feel blessed. You are not just idols for me. You are artists. You are one of my comfort zones (mentally and emotionally). You are a family to me. Don't worry, I manage my time being a fan. Hehe. I still have life outside of the fandom. 

There's a possibility that you might not be a able to read this and that's okay. I just want to say how much grateful I am to all of you. 

All My Love,

All of you work hard, passionately, devotedly, and for hours for this craft; never giving despite the odds. It inspires carats all over the world to work hard and devotedly. The sincerity you have is felt through every song you have produced. The songs that you work on as you think about the messages to carats, thank you so much for caring so deeply for carats and loving us. Thank you for deciding to share a part of your lives with us. There is so much that you give, we don't deserve you and can only give you so much of our love to you. All My Love is so beautifully written and sung. The message of this song is reciprocated by carats. Thank you for being the comfort from the fire, the solace from a hug, the refreshing breeze, the warmth of the sunlight, the energy and strength of a wave and much more for carats.

@jihooniejellybean8793,"T-T  It's our birthday but I'm grateful for their existence. I known and grown with the since debut,  maybe it's because we are close in age but  they are the only group I feel really connected to. I feel like I matured along with them and maybe that's why their songs always connect with the most.                                                 
They have been with me through happy and hard times, unknowingly making me laugh and  giving me words of encouragement/ comfort through their songs and simply talks. 
I don't know how to explain it but when I'm happy their songs make me happier, when I'm sad their songs feel like a hug  and when I'm suffocated/exhausted their songs feel like fresh air. Although some songs do make me feel like  someone just broke  my heart even though I'm single. 
They are are one of the few things that heal me from this fast paced life we live, that  to me often feels like more work than it's worth since it so fragile. 
I hope us(Carats) and Seventeen can continue to make memories with each other for years to come. I'm grateful to be part of this fandom.

Ga kerasa udah 6 tahun juga bareng-bareng sama kalian..
inget banget dulu masa-masa susah nyelesaiin skripsi berjuang untuk lulus, disitu ku menemukan kalian yang lagi berjuang juga untuk debut..

Ngeliat kalian waktu itu buat aku mutusin dukung kalian terus, kayak aku ga akan biarin kalian ga ternotice orang-orang, semua orang harus tau ada kalian yang sangat-sangat berbakat, kalau ternyata kedepannya sulit aku bakal selalu ada disini ngedukung kalian, ga akan biarin kalian berjuang sendiri.. dan aku masih disini sampai hari ini dan Insya Allah dimasa yang akan datang sampai umur memisahkan..

Jadi kpopers dari 2008 tapi baru kalian yang buat aku tergerak pokoknya aku bakal dukung banget, harus beli album.Ketika aku berniat untuk support kalian saat itu aku bener-bener ngelakuin semua hal yang pertama kali selama aku jadi kpopers.. aku tau kalian sebenernya udah cukup lama, 2012/2013? jadi kpopers 2nd gen buat aku banyak tau grup-grup kpop dan itu yang buat aku kenal sama kakak2 kalian, after school, nuest, hello venus. terus denger kabar kalau akan debutin grup dengan member 17 orang, wow banget rasanya.. awalnya ngeliat kalian sekilas doang dari nontonin 17tv, liatin kalian di mv kakak2 kalian, belum belum tergerak untuk cari tau lebih lanjut saat itu, sampai awal tahun 2015 februari atau maret gitu aku denger kabar kalian bakal debut baru aku kepo dengan nontonin video-video latihan kalian, nontonin 17project,  ngeliat gimana usaha kalian ngeliat kepribadian kalian.. buat aku bener-bener jatuh hati sama kalian. 

Kalian adalah anak-anak yang pertama kali buat aku bela-belain cari tau gimana cara live streaming andromeda, live streaming debut plan kalian, gimana cara aku live streaming semua acara music show di korea yang kalian datengin buat perform, caranya live streaming radio di korea buat dengerin kalian kalau lagi ada schedule, gimana caranya aku voting buat kalian ketika masuk nominasi, semua schedule kalian aku ikutin satu-satu.. walaupin kita jauh aku pastikan aku selalu ada disini untuk support kalian, aku selalu ngedampingin kalian walau kalian ga liat aku, hehe..

Kalian beberapa kali masuk nominasi di music show, ga menang bukan berarti aku berhenti buat berusaha lebih keras untuk promosiin dan voting kalian, 4 Mei 2016 sehari setelah aku ulang tahun, kalian tau? salah satu doaku saat itu adalah semoga kalian bisa menang.. dan hari itu doaku dikabulkan.. Pretty U first Win.. nangis, nangis banget sampai gemeter saking senangnya, aku seneng bisa ngeliat kalian nangis bahagia, aku janji bakal ngasih kalian lebih banyak tangis bahagia kedepannya..

Shining Diamond fanmeeting 2016, aku bersyukur ada kesempatan bisa ketemu kalian langsung.. aku yang belum ada kesempatan ngeliat kalian di korea bisa liat kalian di Jakarta. salah satu kenangan bareng kalian yang ga akan aku lupain, bisa liat kalian sedeket itu sampai high touch sama kalian di akhir acara.. hehe udahannya aku gemeteran banget sampai nangis, makasih Seventeen udah dateng untuk ketemu kita-kita di Jakarta..

Perjuangan kita diawal emang berat, aku akuin.. tapi syukur alhamdulillah benar perkataan yang bilang usaha tidak akan mengkhianati hasil, melihat kalian sudah sebesar ini sekarang aku bener-bener senang dan lega.. we made it guys.. sekarang semua orang tau betapa berbakatnya, betapa luar biasanya kalian.. alhamdulillah.. dan aku yakin kalian akan tumbuh semakin besar kedepannya..

Seventeen.. Seungcheol, Jeonghan, Jisoo, Junhui, Soonyoung, Wonwoo, Jihoon, Minghao, Mingyu, Seokmin, Seungkwan, Hansol dan Chan.. adik-adik kesayangan kakak.. kakak tau kalian semua anak-anak yang baik, tetaplah jaga kekompakan kalian ya, selain kalian punya satu sama lain kalian juga punya Carat disini yang bakal selalu dukung kalian, jangan lupa untuk selalu pengertian satu sama lain, saling ngehargain satu sama lain, untuk selalu rendah hati, untuk selalu bersyukur, untuk selalu berjuang dan tidak menyerah, untuk istirahat yang cukup, inget untuk selalu jaga pola makan dan kesehatan kalian ya..
diusia grup kalian yang udah menginjak 6 tahun ini, kakak doain semoga kalian selalu sehat, panjang umur, semakin sukses karir dan percintaannya, semoga lancar dan dimudahkan semua urusan kalian ya, dan semoga kalian bahagia selalu.. aamiin

Sekali lagi, selamat ulang tahun yang ke-6 ya Seventeen..

Aku sayangg banget sama mereka, mereka itu ganteng, lucu, bermultitalend(maap gatau tulisannya:() segalanya lahh pokoknya, bangga banget dahh aku jadi Carat lope lopee, terimakasih juga buat sepupuku yang udah stan mereka hingga aku terbawa juga buat stan mereka

@Soreejillah,"Dear Seventeen,

Ever since I became a Carat just before Pretty U, I cannot even begin to explain the happiness you have provided me. Every album reminds me of different moments in my life, and so listening to you is like listening to the story of my young adult years. How do I write out just how much Seventeen means to me? I can feel it deep in my heart... it's like the same feeling you get when you hang out with your closest friends and you laugh and talk and forget about everything else for a while. It's a fuzzy feeling, a warm hug feeling. Seventeen's music gets me hyped on car rides, gets me in my feels when I'm sentimental, gets me comforted when I cry and gets me grinning from ear to ear when I'm happy. The sheer talent within Seventeen is bigger than Mt. Everest, it could fill up the whole ocean and there would still be some leftover. I am always, always proud to say I am a fan, a Carat. I wish I could say more, but the best words I can give to Seventeen is ""thank you"". I feel so blessed to be part of your journey. I support you and I care for you, I respect you and I love you. Thank you for shining bright for us, Seventeen. <3",0,2021-05-26T23:32:52Z

@carrot17carat,"The things i learned after i slipped into the diamond life 💎

S.copus: ""jangan jadi orang egois""
(Di setiap moment s.coups pasti ngasi member yang lain dulu untuk berpendapat atau apapun itu, selalu mengutamakan grup dibanding dirinya sendiri)
_Best Leader

Jeonghan: ""berani tampil beda, yang penting bisa bikin senang diri sendiri""
(Dia selalu nyari hal-hal yang bisa bikin dia senang kayak main lego sampe pelihara batu, meskipun orang bilang itu aneh tapi dia gak peduli yang penting dia senang dengan hal itu + perhatian walaupun usil)

Joshua: ""sangat baik dalam mengontrol diri sendiri""
(Bayangin dia bisa gak pegang hp berhari2 bahkan dia bilang bisa bulanan, rata2 kita pasti gak bisa begitu + penyabar & gak mudah marah)

Jun: ""walau tingkah dibilang bocah tapi pemikirannya dewasa banget""
(Selalu heran kalo Jun udah ngasi komentar di berbagai acara kayak tertata rapi gitu setiap kata yang diucapkan, cocok jadi temen curhat disamping kita dibercandain tapi kalau dia sudah ngomong pasti nyampe ke hati)

Hoshi: ""sangat mencintai diri sendiri""
(Hoshi bisa sangat Percaya Diri seperti yang kita lihat pasti karena dia percaya banget sama dirinya sendiri klo dia pasti bisa, karena itu dia selalu bekerja keras. Bisa bikin orang-orang disekitarnya senang sama dia terus selalu bikin member yg lain semangat)

Wonwoo: ""selalu berfikir sebelum berbuat""
(Disaat fansign dia bilang benar-benar berhati-hati bicara sama carat supaya gak ada yang tersinggung dengan ucapannya pas bikin rap juga dia bilang gitu, sopan, bijaksana & puitis banget pokoknya. Diajak deeptalk pasti enak)

Woozi: ""pekerja keras""
(Saking pekerja kerasnya dia, dia sampai menganggap pekerjaannya itu jadi hobinya, keren banget sih itu. Berharap bisa kayak woozi bisa mencintai pekerjaan kita disamping lelah yang kita dapat)",0,2021-05-26T22:39:56Z

@tyneola8137,"i know everyone's comments here are their greetings and them reminiscing their memories. but id like to take this moment to say that SEVENTEEN NEVER FAILS to spoil their fans with songs either rare or have never been performed or if ever its been performed already, they always come up with a different version or put a twist to it. they dont repeat songs or latest title tracks over and over again not unless its for music show promotion and thats important, to listen and be aware of what your audience's lets say, ""wishlists"" or what the fan favorites are to keep them satisfied and keep them engaged and theyre doing that. also bc all of their discographies are worthy to be flexed and performed whether its for a special video, for a concert or whatever content it is. as long as theyre up for it and only probably a few artists (not that i know any other) are doing that cause mostly are just repeating their title tracks and some latest B-sides. also id like to point out how ALL of the members can sing so well despite, example, the hiphop unit, some of them probably prefer powerful rap or heavy music type of songs but theyre also good in ballads too. every member shined through and was able to showcase their individual range, character and color and the style of singing and when you put them together, it feels like a finished cake with icing and cherry on top. also i like how this sounds much better compared to their last performance of All My Love from SMA. their voices just kept improving and getting fuller. I already poured my heart so much in this one comment. nothing else to say here. I love SEVENTEEN so much and I knew I was going to be invested the moment I saw their Home Run performance from MAMA 2020. it was like love at first sight of that stage.

@My-yg8hd,"i see a lot of carats writing thank you to seventeen here in their native languages, so that's what I'm going to do too.

Seventeen, jag tror aldrig riktigt jag kommer kunna förklara riktigt hur mycket jag uppskattar er och hur tacksam jag är för att ni existerar. Jag är extremt tacksam för att ni hjälper mig och så många andra carats världen över varje dag, bara med era videos eller era låtar. Ni har blivit som en säker plats för mig här på internet, som mitt hem. Hela seventeen som grupp och alla carats känns som en ända stor familj, och jag känner mig mer trygg än någonsin med er. Jag önskar verkligen att jag kunde finnas för er på samma sätt som ni funnits där för mig. Så jag säger stort tack, jag älskar er. Thank you, I love you. ❤❤",131,2021-05-26T21:14:21Z

Aku salah satu Carats Indonesia

Selamat 6 tahunan cie dah bisa masuk sd xixixi

Ga ga ga ga kali ini serius

Hai, Seventeen
Aku salah satu Carats Indonesia

Awal aku kenal kalian tiba-tiba kalian nongol di twitter aku (Seventeen Tv), awalnya aku ga tertarik, tapi setelah itu kalian muncul lagi di beranda youtube aku lalu aku memutuskan nonton kalian. Dari masa trainee aku udah kagum sama kalian, tapi yg bikin paling suka adalah guyonan-guyonan, kehebohan dan moment-moment uwu kalian. Singkat cerita kalian udah debut dengan Adore U lalu Mansae dan tim dance coverku langsung coverin kalian, rasanya bangga banget. Beberapa tahun setelah kalian debut, kalian dateng buat konser ke Indonesia, aku udah beli tiket konser, udah beli tiket ke jakarta dan segala tetek bengeknya tapi aku gagal terbang ke jakarta karna ada prestasi yg harus aku kejar (lomba dance cover), maaf aku ga dateng hari itu tapi aku tau temen-temen caratku yg lain did a great job supporting u there at the venue. Proud of u Carats! Dan... ga kerasa udah 6 tahun aja umurnya, makin tua ya hahaha selamat menua bersama, Seventeen. Kalian semua ber-13 inspirasi aku, penyemangat aku, alasan aku bangkit dari keterpurukan, alasan aku lebih menghargai hidup, terima kasih banyak untuk kerja kerasnya, untuk pengorbanan kalian, untuk senyum dan tawa yg kalian lukis di wajah Carats, and thankyou for being Seventeen.

@ayuannur9557,"The level of aesthetic in this video can't be ranked, really. 

I want to tell my own story about my journey as Carat too. 
The first time me and my sister met you guys was through a video Special stage] SEVENTEEN - girl group medley, 세븐틴 - 걸그룹 메들리 Show Music core 20160416 
Just because of you guys covered Gfriend's Rough in so manly ways that we started to feel curious.
We watched start from your predebut to debut stages, then watch the Weekly Idol and One Fine Day (though with OFD I feel sick and worried for you guys while watched all of it).
We slipped hardly into the diamond life after that. 
We first met at ICE BSD, Tangerang Selatan for you guys Diamond Edge's concert in 2017. My big brother and mother were there all the time. My mother and little sister fall so hard for DK and Joshua. I love Jun but always got wrecked by Dino (PLEDIS JUST RELEASE DINO'S SOLO PERFORMANCE ALREADY) and Woozi. and And since we saw you guys, my big brother always mentioned ""THIS IS HOW MEN SUPPOSED TO PERFORM!"" and always felt bitter if you guys got snatched in Award performances. We three siblings memorized all of your songs. My big brother who only loves games and computer the entire life would sulking if you guys are always the second. My little sister even printed out all of your best photos and spread it around her peers and friends, just to make you guys being much more popular. (Sssht, her friends all are NCTzen 😂😂😂😂) 
My mother poisoned our cousins and auntie too with the love for you guys, since my cousin worked on Shopee Indonesia and her boyfriend has a close relative who worked on Tokopedia, she got sick by frequently hearing (ahem sorry) BP and BTS. So even they got dragged and vocally active presented ""How about SEVENTEEN?"" to their superiors and supervisors 😂😂😂 especially since it was around from Thanks era to Getting Closer. 
But they said Seventeen animo in Indonesia though its large, but nowhere near level BP and BTS, nor if they want it to be down to earth, near the level of Got7 and Gfriend. So darn frustrating! 

While me myself save my winning money from some poems and Indonesian Sastra competitions to bought your albums, while my mother bought the album of our family. My father even cant think of anything else except saying ""No wonder, these boys are so handsome."" 
I tried to drag my own friends. But most of them mostly Cassiopeia, Exo-L and Elf, while my best friend stanning SNSD. They still after all the years. 
My best friends from writing community and research friends then got dragged and love both DK and Woozi! I even joking with my friends about how I wait for your dating news, since I want to brag and be happy for your love too. 

We're so proud that we make them drink the most  beatifully contagious poisons called Seventeen. 

I love how Carats community are so chills and never ever faking or forcing they themselves to love you guys. Fake streams? Nope. We watched it repetitively just because we love how amazing the music, choreography, and content are, not just because we want to present ""number of views"". 

One day when I feel so sad and lonely, I cried so hard after listening to your guys Smile Flower and Us Again. I got cried again after I heard you guys recommend these two songs. You guys are here with me when I go to college, when I'm on the bus, my Mama singing along to you when she proceeded with surgery to relax herself, you guys were there when my big brother screaming fanchants while playing his games, you guys here for my little sister and me so we screamed cried laughing along side you guys too. You guys were there when I failed my college exams and long after that when  received my scholarship. You guys are here when I had my heart broken or when our most beloved cat, Ciel, sleeping loudly after hearing your song being played in the laptop. You guys are here for my family in the time we lost our most beloved cat too. You guys are here when me and my siblings were sad in the meantime Fairy Tail played their last ""Snow Fairy, don't say goodbye!"" 

Our words and love alone cannot ever convey how much we love you guys. ❤❤❤😭😭😭 We are incredibly sad since the pandemic cut our chance to meet again. We cursed it out with all of our heart but also feel thankful since you guys can take a rest, rest and appreciation that all of you deserve so much. 

You guys posted this within my birthday (23rd May) and my sister's birthday (28th May). You guys are within us too. 

Thank you for being born and meeting us! The best encounter ever we won't ever change with anything.

I won't ask for forever, but let's be together for a very long time.",0,2021-05-26T19:22:59Z

@charinaikayulianti3716,"Pengen cerita. Seventeen debut jaman aku kuliah. Dulu cuma tau mereka sekilas-sekilas aja. Sampe suatu siang temen ngenalin sama Dont wanna cry, aku bilang ""ga ah ga suka Seventeen, kebanyakan orangnya, lagunya juga biasa aja, susah ngapalin wajahnya, kaga nemu yang cakep!"". Orgil banget emang dulu, cakep banget mereka padahal :((
Keras kepala sekali bilang ga akan kena racun.

Tiba-tiba denger Check In di TV, kok enak. Penasaran denger lagi Pretty You, kok jadi semangat. Paling kepentok pas denger Home, kok berasa punya tempat, berasa disayang sekali. Ga keitung berapa kali muter Home. Mulai deh kucari tau mereka siapa. Aku jadi Carat jalur karma wkwkw.

Sampe akhirnya nemu clip Gose yang Mousebuster, aku yang ga suka nonton variety show, eh gara2 mereka sengklek aku jadi suka. Gose sekarang jadi tempat aku lari dari hari-hari yang kelam. Kalau sedih, kesepian rewatch Gose.

Terima kasih ya Seventeen. Kalian ga akan bisa kira sebesar apa dampak baik yang udah kalian beri buat aku di hari-hari yang panjang ini. Ayo kita bareng-bareng terus ya. Sehat-sehat 💕",1,2021-05-26T19:13:10Z

@aristeenheartbeatsfast7227,"Es divertido pensar cómo es que hace un año realmente no me interesaba el kpop pero con la cuarentena me fui acercando poco a poco a la industria, SEVENTEEN y otro grupo realmente mejoraron mi vida con tan tremendas canciones que, cuando quieren transmitir paz, lo hacen; tristeza, lo hacen; alegría, lo hacen, simplemente escucharlos es una delicia, tanto los 13 juntos como por sus unidades. Como este grupo no habrá dos (aunque suene pretencioso) porque cargan una sensibilidad por la música que muy pocos tienen.

Thank you for being there for me these past 6 years. When you first debuted, your energy, freshness, and passion invigorated me, and just as I have grown throughout the years since then (going through college, graduating, working, now in medical school), it has been such a joy to see you all grow and mature as well. Thank you for capturing my youth and all the emotions that come with it: the bittersweetness, the sadness - but also the happiness and the excitement of it all. I've seen you beat all the odds, growing steadily over time, never losing your initial humility. Let's go a long way, Seventeen! Love you all! <3",103,2021-05-26T18:14:37Z

Han pasado seis años desde que debutaron y cuatro desde que estoy con ustedes, cuatro años que tal vez para algunos serán pocos, pero para mi, para mi han sido tan especiales. Estoy muy orgullosa, ni siquiera puedo expresar todo lo que siento. Deseo que podamos seguir juntos por mucho mas tiempo, de igual forma, tengo la esperanza de que en el futuro podamos vernos cara a cara. 
Espero que hayan tenido un buen día, sigan esforzándose como lo han hecho hasta ahora. 
No se les olvide descansar y tomar agüita, tampoco se exijan demasiado y tómenlo con calma, saben que aquí estaremos pase lo que pase. 

Sigamos brillando hasta el final.

Aku mau ikutan curhat jugaaa:(
Aku baru jadi kpopers 3 tahun ini dan grup pertama kali aku stan ya Seventeen. Aku mau ngucapin makasih buat temenku yang ngenalin kpop lagi? (Iya lagi soalnya pas SD sempet suka tapi pas smp aku udh stop) dan yang dikenalin itu sebong. Di akhir bulan Februari 2018 aku diajak nonton MV DWC, thanks, clap, boom boom, dll, trus variety show, sampe isac tentang sebong juga, di situ aku gapaham apa apa tapi pas denger lagunya enak, asik, pokoknya pulang pulang ngepoin lagi sebong lewat gugel trus nontonin mv, video-video sebong deh.. sampe memutuskan jadi carat walaupun di 2020 an sempet ga terlalu ngikutin karena berasa lg down, tapi pas lg down gini sebong lewat lagi di sosmed dan akhirnya ketarik lagi... sebong ini jadi salah satu support system buat aku<3 aku ngerasa aku bisa lebih hargai diri sendiri hihi..
Kadang suka ngerasa nyesel kenapa ga kenal keluarga ini dari zaman tembok ijo gtu hehe, tapi gapapa aku mau menjaga yang sekarang aja sampe seterusnyaaaa{}

Tahun 2014 saya berusaha berhenti obsesi ke kpop demi kebaikan saya dan demi fokus menjalani SMA. Tapi tahun 2017 teman kuliah saya memperlihatkan dance practice seventeen nice ,yg waktu itu saya pikirkan adalah ""gila penari latar nya kuat semua"" dan ""itu yg rambut panjang cakep :v"" berawal dari ingin tahu jeonghan akhirnya saya terjatuh lagi ke dunia kpopers -__- dan menyukai seluruh member seventeen.

@Yasmin-ld8ev,"seventeen, nama yg selalu aku ikuti dari jaman2 seventeen project.
inget banget waktu itu lg bosen banget sama kpop. lagi fokus kelas 12 sma. fokus belajar terus tiap hari. temen dikit. kosong. terus kalian debut. menemani kelas 12ku yg semakin kesepian. membuat aku percaya gapapa buat fokus sama diri sendiri dulu biar bisa kuliah di tempat yg aku mau. aku selalu muter still lonely setiap hari menuju sbmptn. 4 jam belajar bener2 denger lagu itu aja biar tenang. selalu bilang gapapa kalau sendiri 

terus kuliah, gak dapet jurusan yg dimau. gak nyangka sampe drop mental di tahun pertama dan lagu kalian masih jadi penyelamat. terus sbmptn ulang, balik lagi bikin playlist lagu2 kalian dan tentu tetep balik ke still lonely. 

jaman2nya mencoba keluar dari toxic attachment di relationship, lagu fear keluar. aku jadi mikir. banyak sekali berfikir. dan akhirnya berdamai sama diri sendiri :)

sekarang lagi skripsian, aku udah jauh lebih baik dari dulu. walau capek harus magang di beberapa tempat sambil skripsi tapi selalu kehibur sama gose kalian tiap pekan. ngeliatin obrolan kalian di weverse aja udh bisa ngobatin rasa lelah kerja. apalagi puitisnya wonwoo atau peliharaannya jeonghan😂 oh iya, sekarang aku selalu dengerin together tiap skripsian loh! lagunya hangat banget. ngeyakinin aku bahwa aku akan terus bisa.

kita jalan terus bareng-bareng ya? meskipun nanti aku bakal lebih sibuk kerja, mungkin menikah, dan duniaku sendiri. meskipun nanti kalian bakal fokus individual project dan wajib militer. semoga kita selalu tetap bisa jalan beriringan. terima kasih sudah menolong aku di saat2 sulitku dengan musik kalian. selalu bersyukur bisa kenal kalian dan karya2nya☺❤",90,2021-05-26T17:45:18Z

@simpingforgyu,"to Seventeen and Carats,

Yesterday morning, I remember counting down for when it would be May 26th 12 AM KST. One of the first things I did was reach out to my online carat friends and wish us a happy anniversary, reminiscing on my friendships with them and how svt had brought us together. Then we start reminiscing on the past six years with svt and how much y'all have grown. Thank you, and I feel like thank you will never be enough to encapsulate all that I mean. But thank you so much for allowing us in your lives, for letting us watch you grow and to grow with you. Svt is home. I have never found anything else, let alone another group that makes me feel so at home, so warm. Your music feels like a hug, wrapping me with the warmth of the sun setting. I got so emotional reading y'all's post on weverse, listening to Carat's version of thank you for being born, I was crying all morning. We are so so proud of y'all. Please remember that we are always here to support you. Don't forget that you have one another, please cherish one another and the bond y'all have. Remember to take breaks (running itself is tough enough, but not running is an option too) and know we will always be waiting patiently. Thank you for letting us cherish you.

Happy six years, my loves.",53,2021-05-26T17:29:00Z

@danarii_,"Dear: Seventeen

El 18 de Julio del 2017 conocí a 13 chicos que a pesar de no haberlos conocido desde su debut se han convertido en algo especial para mi, que me han ayudado desde tan larga distancia y que quiero proteger desde de la misma forma.

Han sido tantos los momentos que he vivido a su lado, momentos en los que he estado y en los que no, pero eso no evita que me sienta orgullosa y que me hicieran llorar de la misma forma que a todas, como por ejemplo cuando ganaron su firts Win con Pretty U o cuando sus familias les devolvieron sus anillos en seventeen proyect.

Adoro cada una voces, de sus palabras, de sus canciones. Cada uno de ellos son la razón por la que quiero estar viva, por la que lucho y me esfuerzo cada día, y seguir apoyandolos con el hermoso nombre de carat es algo de lo que nunca me voy a arrepentir de por vida.

En algún momento de mi vida miraré hacia atrás, hacia mi pasado -que justo ahora es mi presente-, y cuando lo haga quiero estar orgullosa de haberme llamado Carat, estar feliz de haber crecido junto con ellos, de haber reído, disfrutado y adorado cada momento.",1,2021-05-26T17:18:12Z

I could never have the right words to express what SEVENTEEN means to me today. By seeing those focus of them one by one I understood one more time how much I love them, so much. It is impossible to explain. And I couldn't be more thankful to call myself a CARAT, cause that really feels like home. Really. Thank you just like in the song",0,2021-05-26T17:13:24Z

@nadiarafifah2348,"Liat carat pada nulis ucapan-ucapan buat seventeen, aku juga mau ikutan, hehe. 

Kenalin, aku baby carat, baru banget jadi carat 3 bulan yang lalu. Aku udah kenal mereka dari 2019 sebenernya, tapi baru stan sekarang. Nyesel bgt, kenapa ga stan dari dulu aja..
Eum, oke, udah cukup perkenalannya, hehe. 

Kalo di inget-inget lagi, aku stan mereka karena lagu Hug dan Going Seventeen. Lagu itu bener-bener nenangin aku pake banget. Waktu itu, aku stan mereka pas aku lagi kacau-kacaunya, terus tiba-tiba aku nemu playlist soft lagunya seventeen. Dengerin lagu-lagu mereka di playlist itu bikin tenang banget. Smile Flower, pinhweel, sama don't listen in secret juga bikin nangis banget. Nangisnya tuh karena lagunya tuh bisa banget bikin aku tenang dan ngelupain masalah aku. Emang ya, lagu seventeen tuh ga ada yg ga bagus, apa lagi lagu balad nyaㅠㅠ 

Ah iya, Going seventeen. Aku pertama kali nonton gose itu gose 2020 yang eps hantu itu, aku lupa eps berapaㅠㅠ terus ketagihan. Eps fav aku itu don't lie 1 sama 2, TTT juga! Aku tiap nonton gose kaya langsung lupa sama masalah, dan langsung senyum, padahal baru intro doang. Ya.. walaupun lupa nya cuma sebentar, hehe. 
Udah, segitu aja ceritanya, udah panjang bgt, haha.

Terima kasih, Seventeen. Makasih karena udah bertahan sampai 6 tahun ini. Makasih karena udah nyiptain lagu-lagu yang bagus banget. Makasih, karena lagu-lagu kalian aku bisa bertahan sampe sekarang. Makasih banget udah bikin lagu-lagu yang selalu bisa bikin aku tenang. Makasih banget karena senyum kalian selalu bisa bikin suasana hati aku naik lagi. Dan juga, Terima kasih S.Coups karena udah jadi Leader yang sangat baik. Leader yang ga hanya sayang sama member, tapi juga sayang sama Carat. 

Aku gatau lagi harus nulis apa, karena rasa terima kasih dan rasa sayang aku ke kalian gabisa dijabarin satu-satu. 

Pokoknya Terima Kasih. Semoga kalian bisa bertahan sampe 10 tahun, atau 20 tahun kedepan. 

I really Love you guys❣",0,2021-05-26T17:02:51Z

Though i’ve only ever watched them through a screen, they’ve helped me more than i think they could even imagine. this is my first anniversary.

Well, now it’s been like a year since I became a Carat (wow, it’s already been so long??), and don’t stan Seventeen earlier is one of my biggest regrets haha
You all came to my life in a really hard time and helped so much to go through it, and I fell so thankful that I can’t put in words... I don’t know if I would be here without you all :( 
I don’t usually say that, but I love you guys. 
I have so much respect and admiration for your job; you’re changing lives with your music! 
I just feel proud of everything Seventeen (and Carats! Haha) are reaching (?), please keep it up! I know that’s dark moments when you just wanna give up, and I say that by my own experience, but don’t do that... You’ll always have Carats and each others. You’re music save lives, but don’t risk yours for it.

@elokdarazulisma1291,"Hallo Seventeen, 
Pada tahun debut kalian 2015 aku sempat menjadi orang yang menyukai banyak grup dan memasuki fandomnya termasuk kalian, namun perlahan aku meninggalkannya sampai april 2016 aku memutuskan untuk menjadi seorang CARAT semata, entah apa yang membuat diri ini kagum ke kalian aku tidak bisa menjelaskannya secara spesifik yang jelas di awal saat menonton sebuah acara musik aku menemukan sebuah kehangatan dan ketulusan waktu itu dari senyuman seorang S.COUPS ketika menatap ke kamera disitulah aku yakin untuk mendukung SEVENTEEN lebih lagi, lambat laun semakin dalam aku menyelam menjadi seorang CARAT aku tidak bisa keluar dan meninggalkan kalian terlalu nyaman diri ini mejadi bagian dari SEVENTEEN & CARAT
Terima kasih sudah menemani diri ini sampai sekarang kurang lebih 5 tahun 11 bulan, meski aku sedikit menyesal diawal tidak mengetahui kalian sejak tembok hijau, namun penyesalan itu lambat laun mulai tidak aku pikirkan lagi karena terlalu banyak rasa kasih sayang yang kalian berikan kepada carat sehingga aku dapat melupakannya, terima kasih selalu menjadi peneman diri ini ketika sedih maupun senang terutama menjadi peneman diriku dimalam hari waktu belajar ataupun mencatat materi kuliah... Kalian sudah ku anggap sebagai rumah kedua ku.

Semangat kesayangan CARAT Choi Seungcheol, Yoon Jeonghan , Hong Jisoo, Wen Junhui, Kwon Soonyoung, Jeon Wonwoo, Lee Jihoon, Lee Dokyeom, Kim Mingyu,  Xu Minghao, Boo Seungkwan, Chwe Hansol, Lee Chan, tetap menjadi SEVENTEEN yang selalu dibanggakan oleh diriku dan CARAT. 
Terima Kasih kalian telah berusaha keras sampai detik ini, jaga kesehatan kalian mari berjalan bersama - sama dalam jangka panjang. I Love U SEVENTEEN🥰💎",8,2021-05-26T16:44:06Z

@nesiakristian369,"Thankyou for this amazing song. One of my favorite in Semi;colon after Doremi..
banyak CARAT INA yang cerita awal kenal SVT. Dan gue akan cerita juga.
Seriously, this group made me to do a Fangirling.. biasanya cuman nonton MV sekali cukup, dan skrg bisa nonton MV berkali-kali (di era left n right)
Biasa bisa nonton semua MV comeback group manapun, ini skrg gue cuman nonton SVT doank dan bahkan ga mau nonton mv lain, krn sensi takut v17ws nya lebih banyak wkwkwk
semua ini berkat Coronce sih, kalo ga koronce mungkin Juni 2020 gue tidak menemukan Seventeen dan Gose.
I know SVT since 2017 with DWC (and last week i found my Line Post which i wrote for them, as i apreciate their Sync 2x dance on weekly idol).
But i dont stan them on that time, i just love their title song..
And then On June 2020, i watched Hit the Road, waited for their comeback, and still voted them on MAMA everyday...
And now, even i dont obsess again with them, i still waited for their gose.... every week...
Thankyou seventeen for being seventeen. If one of them missing, i think it will not be the same.
I hope they will go through the 7yearcurse... THANKYOU ONCE AGAIN SEVENTEEN AND ALSO MY CARAT FELLAS..

thank you for existing and being there when i was hopeless when i needed comfort, thank you for enduring your hardships and enduring all the pain and thank you for sacrifices that you guys made just to become the group you guys are, you can choose a normal concept but you guys choose to inspire and made a safe place where everyone can go to when they needed and im sorry if i cant be there for you when you are having a hard time and i love you guys, 

thank you for being there  when i thought i was fighting alone and i thought everything is crumbling and everything seems so dark but you guys helped through your songs and honestly i didnt know what ill be if i didnt click that one lyric video of thanks on my youtube  recommendation, i know this is just one of the many letters that you recive but you guys helped us alot of stragers pass through our hard time and thank you for entertaining us and comforting us through your own ways, even just a single selca or good morning cheered ALOT of carats without you guys knowing and  yea 谢谢你们， 然后 我爱你们",273,2021-05-26T16:27:04Z

Tak apa, itu semua proses utk kita bersama bisa tumbuh menuju kedewasaan. Rasanya ngestan seventeen tuh, bukan hanya kayak hubungan antara fans dan idolnya, tp lebih dari itu, dan emang bener yg dikatakan scoups sih, hubungan ini cuman kita aja yg tau rasanya :""))

Ga terasa ya udah 6 tahun aja sekarang. Perasaan baru kemaren banget aku ngestan kalian. Baru kemaren banget jadi bagian dari carat. Eh tau taunya udah 4 kali aja aku ngerayain anniversary bareng kalian. ♡
Eh iya, makasih ya udah hadir di hidupku. Agak nyesal sih ga ngikutin kalian dari awal banget, paling nggak dari kalian debut. Kata mereka ga ada kata terlambat untuk mencintai kalian, karena semua akan mencintai kalian disaat yang tepat. Tapi ga tau kenapa tetep aja gitu nyesel ga ngestan dari awal. ◞‸◟ tapi yasudahlah. Yang penting aku sudah berada di tempat yang tepat, di fandom yang tepat dan mencintai orang yang tepat.
Oiya, makasih ya udah mengajarkan aku untuk lebih mencintai diriku sendiri meskipun aku belum bisa melakukannya dengan baik dan sempurna tapi makasih banget. Heheh.. Makasih udah buat aku merasa dicintai. Disaat aku merasa sendirian, kalian hadir dengan lagu lagu indah kalian. Disaat aku merasa tak ada seorangpun yang mencintaiku, kalian hadir dan membuatku merasa dicintai. Padahal kita belum pernah ketemu heheh.
Dan makasih juga udah ngebantuin aku keluar dari dunia yang gelap dengan karya karya kalian yang luar biasa. Dengan kekocakan kalian juga. Makasih udah nyuruh istirahat disaat lelah. Aku ga pernah menyadari pentingnya beristirahat sampai akhirnya kalian menyadari ku betapa pentingnya istirahat itu.
Tau ga sih kalian pernah nyelamatin hidupku cuma dengan lagu kalian? Wkwk. Lebay kan? Tapi emang bener. Aku masih disini karena kalian. Jadi teruslah berkarya dan menghibur banyak orang. Aku yakin ga cuma aku yang ngerasa kalau kalian itu penyelamat dan penyemangat setiap harinya. 

Sukses selalu dan mari sama sama melangkah ke depan dan meraih apa yang kita harapkan bersama.

Ga pinter ngerangkai kata kata aku tuh hiks. Tapi semoga ini nyampe di kalian meskipun bahasa yang ku pake ga kalian mengerti. Gapapa. Yang penting nyampe aja hehe.",0,2021-05-26T16:16:11Z

致、SEVENTEEN
恭喜你们通关了第五级，并开启了第六级的挑战。
这非常的可喜可贺，也希望你们能平平安安、一路上顺顺利利。
粉丝们最害怕看到也最心疼的，就是你们传来受伤或是任何不好的消息。
所以希望你们能健健康康做你们想做的音乐，展现你们所要展现的舞台，带给我们欢乐与幸福，同时也希望你们能得到更多的尊重与支持。
无论如何，克拉们永远都会在你们身后守护着并支持着你们。
只要你们回头一看，就能看到成群结队的我们。

致、CARAT
无论你是多少年的粉丝，甚至是今天才刚成为克拉，都不算太晚。
成为粉丝没有分早或迟，你们能体会到SEVENTEEN的舞台与歌曲魅力，并且入坑，对于SEVENTEEN来说，已经是最欣慰且满足的事情了。
只希望大家能好好守护他们，外界的恶意太多太重，当他们都感到身心疲惫之时，希望我们当中不要再有人落井下石，如果没办法选择继续守护并支持他们，就请直接离开，别再给二次伤害。
他们好歹也是他们父母的宝贝儿子，二次伤害之前请换个立场想想，如果自己以后的孩子遭受这样的恶意，你还会选择这种做法吗？
粉丝圈就像个小社会，希望我们能在其中学会如何善意对待他人，强硬抵抗外来恶意，互相包容，互相了解，并不是互相攀比，互相嘲讽。

无论如何，我很感谢自己闯进了这个克拉圈子，也很感谢SEVENTEEN依旧初心地制作好音乐、创造好舞台，也感谢因为喜欢SEVENTEEN而遇到的克拉朋友们，能让我在充满压迫气息的现实生活里有个喘息的机会。

SEVENTEEN，六周年快乐，祝你们一帆风顺，前途持续似锦。",1,2021-05-26T16:07:17Z

안녕 나의 기쁨이여
깊은 절망에도

아는 노랠 틀고 One step
두 손을 잡고 발을 Two step
어느새 오늘의 나에게
내일의 널 바라게 해
Baby It’s alright
Oh It’s okay
내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라 O ah 더 고마워
가끔은 지쳐
고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때 
어쩔 줄 모르는 난 뭘 할 수 있을까

그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 고마워

어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해
쏟아지는 유성우처럼
까만 하늘에 빛이 돼 줘
I can do everything for you
난 너에게
뭐든지 다 주고 싶은 마음만 커서
작아지는 나는 받기만 하는 바보

이 노래와 가사뿐이지만
For you for you for you for you
이 노랜 널 위해 불러 Tonight
네 사랑에 다가갈 수 있게
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼

@aiyukahan5858,"Dear SEVENTEEN, 
You guys came when I least expected it.. Never in my life I thought I would attached to these wonderful 13 guys.. ""Love will always find a way"" I guess it's true tho.  I heard about you guys few times even I met you few times earlier in Nuest ""Face"" and Hello Venus mv but I never thought all of you would gonna to be this important in my life.. During one breaking point in my life, you guys kept appeared around my surrounding till I finally paid attention to you guys.. At first I thought I wont be interested to you guys again after I watched Mansae mv then few months later I heard about you guys again.. I suddenly became interested to see your new song and I watched it, I like it.. I slowly became a fan.. I slowly catching up with your content.. I became curious then I found out how I actually have met you guys before in your senior mv.. It was shocking to me how you guys kept on coming yet I never really paid attention to you until the right moment; where I finally became a fan.. I felt addicted to you guys more than your music.. I only heard few songs but since the addiction is overwhelming and making me wanting more and more from you guys, I finally opened my heart to hear all songs in your album (which I never did this to any groups) Guess what? I felt so much regret of how I wasted so much time before.. Why didnt I stan you guys from the start? Didnt know you guys are this great in making music.. You guys really on the next level idol.. I found so much happiness in you guys.. Every small gesture from you guys hit me to the heart.. I feel loved and appreciated by how much you guys love us.. I love how our bond is strong, our relationship between idol and fan is healthy.. I love your positiveness and passion to be better and do what you like and live your moment to the fullest.. Thank you so much for coming to my life.. My youth is wonderful because I'm with SEVENTEEN.. Let's walk on the flowery path together.. Seranghae~ 💖",0,2021-05-26T16:06:17Z

From one of carats

Sebenernya terdorong buat ini karena lihat komen2 banyak yg mencurahkan isi hatinya terkait sebong wkwk. 
Oke. Seventeen terimakasih karena kalian ada dan hadir di hidup aku, semua lagu yang kalian buat dan nyanyikan itu benar2 punya aura tersendiri yang bukan hanya sekedar lagu ataupun musik, karena aku bisa merasakan setiap emosi dan pesan yg ingin kalian sampaikan disana.

Seventeen, sekali lagi terimakasih karena kalian lahir di dunia ini. Keberadaan kalian membuat aku mengerti bahwa setiap orang memiliki potensi dan bakatnya. Terimakasih dengan segala keceriaan dan tawa yg kalian berikan kepada kami, sungguh dengan hal itu di hari yang lelah, hari yang membuatku terpuruk dan menyesali semuanya suara kalian saja pun sudah membuatku bahagia, apalagi tawa kalian. Nonton gose benar2 seperti salah satu kegiatan yang tidak pernah ingin kulewatkan, yaa karena melihat kalian seperti mencharge kembali energi yg tadinya sudah menghilang.

Seventeen, sekali lagi terimakasih. Teruslah berkarya dan menjadi motivasi untuk semua orang. Kalian berharga, i'll stay with you as always i can!!

*terimakasih juga untuk semua carat, kalian hebatt. Salah satu fandom yg memberikan kenyamanan tersendiri. Tetap ingat kita jangan sampai war karena seventeen tidak perlu hal itu. Uri sebong hanya butuh dukungan dan cinta kalian.
Dan terimakasih teman SMA ku yg sudah membiarkan aku ngeliat laptopnya trus tanpa sengaja ngeliat mv sebong yg mansae dan langsung jatuh hati sama s.coups. sampe kepo nontonin semua ofd 1,2 , svt project dll. Sampai sekarang masih ttp bisa mendengarkan semua karya Seventeen, sebuah grup dengan talent dan kebaikan hati yang memikat. Sekali lagi terimakasih.

Dah lama rupanya duk dalam fandom ni. Kalau anak ni dah masuk tadika dah.. heee

Semoga tahun ini lebih baik dari tahun lepas dan tahun depan lebih baik dari tahun-tahun sebelumnya. Tak tahu nak cakap apa tapi Sebongie mesti faham kan Carat nak cakap apa. Betapa kitorang ni sayang giler kat korang. Teruskan menuju ke hadapan, kitorang akan tetap berada di belakang sokong korang, jalan sama-sama, jatuh bangun kami tetap sayang korang sampai bila-bila, dengan izin-Nya. Terima kasih sebab sentiasa menjadi buah hati pengeran jantung kami. Lepastu tak jemu-jemu duk suap macam-macam tak pernah tinggal. Jaga kesihatan, jaga SOP, InshaaAllah kalau ada jodoh tahun depan boleh jumpa lagi ramai-ramai. Sumpah tak pernah rasa menyesal suka korang. Tujuh belas sampai Tujuh Puluh. Dan selamanya.

Kepada carat, terima kasih kerana tetap ada dengan Seventeen. Mungkin kita sibuk, takde masa untuk diorang. Tapi tak bermakna kita tak sayang, kan. Betul tak?

Salam sayang dari Malaysia.

P/S: Semoga covid cepat hilang dan keadaan kembali macam biasa. Rindu giler nak berfanchant ramai-ramai masa konsert. Jaga diri!

Happy 6th anniversary Seventeen.

Been so long in this fandom. If It was a baby, it must be in kindergarten right now. Heee

I wish this year is better than past years and next year will be a better year than previous years. I don’t know what to say but Sebongie  must already know what we are going to say. How we love u so much. Keep going forward, we will always be there behind your back supporting you guys, walking together, either when you fall or rise, we will always love you forever, if He permits. Thank you for always became our sweethearts. And keep spoon feed us tirelessly with so many contents. Take care of your health, perhaps we will meet again soon. I swear I never regret love you guys. Seventeen till Seventy. And forever.

To Carats, thanks for always be there for them. We may be busy with our own life, sometimes no time to them. but it doesn’t mean we dont love them right?

Love, Susu from Malaysia.

dear seventeen, maaf baru kenal kalian tahun 2017 pas kalian comeback clap (karna baru suka kpop tahun 2017). maaf baru stan kalian tahun 2018 pas kalian comeback oh my!.
terima kasih udah ngisi hari-hari kita dengan cara ngasih kita banyak asupan konten (terutama masa pandemi ini). hari-hari aku yang tadinya sepi dan ga bermakna langsung berubah setelah tau dan nontonin kalian terus. setiap hari selalu rindu, setiap udh liat pengen liatin terus, kalo udh selesai liat langsung rindu lagi. walaupun aku belum pernah ketemu kalian langsung, tapi entah kenapa rasanya kita tuh deket bgt.
lagu-lagu kalian, lirik di lagu kalian, makna dari lagu kalian, kekeluargaan kalian, itu yang bikin aku mantap untuk stan 1 grup aja, SEVENTEEN. awal aku tau kalo kalian self-producing idol, aku langsung tertarik sama kalian, sekaligus bangga apalagi umur kalian masih 20an. wow.
udah sih, semoga sehat-sehat terus yaa sebong, biar bisa bareng-bareng terus dalam waktu yang lama. horanghae",11,2021-05-26T15:50:40Z

I have big appreciation and love for you, you manage to make me smile everyday, I like how you communicating with Carats it doesn't feel like you're distant at all, I love the music you're making and the friendship you all have. Although I just discovered you last year I feel like I've followed you since the beginning, I feel relaxed watching your content and it always brightens up my mood. All of the members are so talented, every time you release new music, performance or dance, even though I know that it will be highest quality, because your content always is, you still manage to leave me in awe. Everything about you feels so authentic and honest, thank you for sharing with us part of your lives, thank you for being you and thank you for being born.
From the moment I've met you to everything that will happen in the future I'll always follow and support you. I'm so proud of you and I'm proud to be a Carat.",7,2021-05-26T15:49:27Z

@jadev164,"My dear Seventeen,

I've been following your journey for 6 years already. It seems like yesterday when I first watched your debut MV for Adore U but 6 years have gone by already and both you and me have grown and changed so much since. 
I've seen you go from a rookie group with an uncertain future to one of the biggest, most popular and most respected group in the industry. Your creativity, your passion and resilience, your strong bond nurtured by consideration and respect for each other, all of those things have taught me a lot and helped navigate through the toughest moments of my life.
Through those 6 years you've given me comfort when I was tired, joy when I was sad and guidance when I was lost. Words are not enough to express how thankful I am for your existence. The only thing I can say is that, as long as there is a group called Seventeen, there will be me supporting and loving you.

Happy 6 years and cheers to many more years to come and even more success. I love you ❤️",4,2021-05-26T15:35:14Z

Mau cerita gimana pertama kali aku tahu Seventeen nih.. ;-;
Dari dulu aku g pernah sama sekali nge-stan group, sampai suatu hari aku tahu lagu Seventeen ""Very Nice"" untuk pertama kalinya dr Game Pump It Up sejak tahun 2020 ;-;
Aku penasaran sm lagu tsb, kok enak gitu lagu nya berbeda dr yg lain mnrtku. Lalu aku cari di Google, Youtube, Instagram, dan sumber informasi lainnya. Sudah 3 hari menghafal semua nama Seventeen, dan 1 bulan hanya melihat GOSE mereka saja (msh jd Cubic)
Dan tak lama kemudian setelah MV Home;run. Saya sudah menjadi Full-time Carat💎😭

@Sabrina-hz5dr,"hai carat selamat anniversarry 6 tahun, untuk carat yang masih bertahan sampai titik ini, masih bersama dan mendukung seventeen makasih banyak :), jangan tinggalin seventeen ya carat. 
untuk seventeen makasih udah temenin 5 tahun 5 bulan dari masih smp sampai kuliah, terimakasih udah datang disaat yang tepat, saat udah lelah hidup, saat gapunya temen, saat dimana masa sekolah itu rasanya kayak neraka, saat masih males-malesan, saat satu keluarga ga ada waktu untuk peduli, saat sakit keras, saat pengen ngakhirin idup karena udah ngerasa worthless banget.

dan makasih udah jadi motivasi untuk merubah kehidupan, untuk start a whole new page, i'm now not the old me, but a new happy me. i proudly say that i'm no longer unsatisfied with my life, i cherished life more since i know seventeen. terimakasih seventeen udah menempuh dan membantu mencari jalan baru. maaf gabisa ngedukung 100% kayak dulu. i love my family seventeen-carats",7,2021-05-26T15:29:35Z

Dù không biết đến và đi cùng với mọi người từ những ngày đầu tiên, nhưng từ khi trở thành Carat từ năm 2017 mình không hề hối hận chút nào. Tình yêu và tấm lòng cùng những tác phẩm của mọi người đã giúp mình vượt qua những tháng ngày buồn chán. Cho đến hiện tại, những gì mình đã làm cho mọi người không được nhiều và mình cảm thấy có lỗi một chút. Thêm một năm và thật nhiều năm nữa, hãy cùng nhau đi thật lâu nhé! Mọi người hãy giữ gìn sức khỏe và tiếp tục theo đuổi và thực hiện đam mê nhé! Mình sẽ cố gắng hơn nữa để có thể giúp mọi người nhận được những gì xứng đáng trong tương lai.

Hiiii!!! Totoo nga yung sabi ng ibang carats na ""Once you slipped into the diamond life 💎"" hindi ka na makakaalis. Hehehe thank you🥺😘 kasi nandyan kayo nung panahon na naiinip ako, nung panahon na lagi akong malungkot(hanggang ngayon naman kaso nabawasan na heheh😅😅), nung gusto kong umiyak kahit na walang luhang tumutulo sa aking mga mata. 

Basta nandyan kayo sa lahat ng nangyari sa buhay ko umpisang naging fan niyo ko since ""DON'T WANNA CRY"" era heheh

At wala akong pake sa mga rumours niyo na laging nakapalibot sainyo!!!! Basta nandito ako/kami as your carat fans🥺🥰😊


Always be with you all, kahit na mag enlist pa kayo sa mandatory military nyo!!!!! Nandito kaming carats at maghihintay kung maagang man yun mangyari heheh😅😅

Byeeeee!!!!!!! 

And 




HAPPY 6TH ANNIVERSARY SEVENTEEN!!!!

@nasywatsurayya9201,"ssup guys. aku juga mau ikutan cerita :D

awal tau seventeen gegara nonton mv mansae yang gak sengaja lewat dari yt, hapal banget sama warna rambut mingyu yg at first sight mirip ijo telor asin. gak lama, pas aku smp aku ketemu sama fina, my loafly bestie until now yang ngeracunin aku sama sebong sampai akhirnya aku diajak buat main ke tempat luar konser ode to you.

waktu itu aku baru aja abis di tinggal disband sama favorite boygroup ku yang dulu, istilahnya masih patah hati lah. dan begitu aku denger lagu hug, entah kenapa ada rasa bahwa seventeen itu bisa boygroup yang bisa bangkitin my happiness in kpop fangirling world. 

salah satu alasan utama aku nge stan mereka adalah karena vernon. pertama kali seumur hidup ku, aku nge fans dan jatuh cinta kepada idol ku gegara suaranya. vernon punya the way he rapping sendiri yang kalau di jelasin pake kata kata tuh susah banget. intinya dia berciri khas. dan setiap aku denge dia rapp atau nge vocal tuh selalu merding sendiri, kaya, suara dia semudah itu bikin orang jatuh cinta. dan pada akhirnya, di awal tahun kemarin aku mutusin buat stan mereka, slip into the diamond life, dan jadi carat sampai sekarang.

dulu, cita cita ku sendiri selalu di atur sama ortu. ortu pengen aku jadi apa, aku ikutin. ya namanya juga berkhidmat sih yaaa. tapi semenjak seventeen realease membership kit pilot and looked at them how gergeous theyre in pilot uniform, bikin aku kepikiran mau jadi pilot. aku pengen suatu saat bisa pake seragam yang sama kaya mereka. 

SEVENTEEN itu, selain kebahagiaan, juga alasan aku pengen punya masa depan yang cerah. i just want to tell you that, im glad to be a carat :D and, happy aniversarry my hapinnes~ lets being together for a long time, ya.",11,2021-05-26T15:11:19Z

@bintangeu,"The comment section is so beautiful.
I have much to say but suddenly my mind became blank.
Thank you isn't enough to describe how much grateful I am to be a carat. Seventeen is like home to me. Even though maybe I was too late to join this fandom but still I feel so welcomed. Seventeen really healed me thru the pandemic. Now it's been like a year(?) since I started stanning them. Honestly saying, I've been a kpop stan since 2010 but seventeen really is something else. Maybe it's because I am older and more matured to know what love is. And yes seventeen is love. They meant everything to me. Thinking that this year is the sixth anniversary, made me thinking that will there be the seventh? God , I hate thinking about that but yeah I do thought about it. But no matter what will happen, carats will always stay with seventeen, supporting you guys in everything you guys did.
Till then, thank you so much for being with me when I was at my lowest, when there's no one with me. Thank you so much.
I love you guys so much.♡",162,2021-05-26T15:09:25Z

mai bri khush hu ki mene seventeen to follow(mai stan ki jghe follow use kr rhi hou kyuki stan sbd shi nhi lgta hai) krna suru kiya, yeh meri zindagi ka sbse bra step hai jo maine ek dm shi liya. mai seventeen ko 2016 se jnti hou pr kbhi follow nhi kiya kyuki mai dusri group ki fan thi aur mujhe lgta tha ki mujhe bs unhi ko stan krna chahiye aur kisi ko nhi, pr mai glt thi, kaash mene seventeen ko suru se support kiya hota itne sme ignore krne ki jagah, kaash mai itni bri buddhu fan nhi hoti, pr abh jo ho gya voh ho gya, mai use change nhi kr skti, uski bajai mai inhe aur saalo saal tk support kr skti hou. mujhe suru se seventeen ka music accha lgta tha pr mere andr ye soch thi ki agr mai kisi aur group ko follow krungi toh mai apne pehle group ko dokha de rhi hou, iske baadjud mai seventeen ke songs jo bhut sunti thi. Toh seventeen ko 2 saal tk dekhne ke baad mene unhe follow krne ka socha, ye mere second group hai jinko mene follow kiya. mujhe lgta tha ki koi baat nhi, mai chahe kitne bhi groups ko follow kru mera first group hmase top pr rhega, pr nhi, mujhe pata bhi nhi chala aur seventeen achanak se top pr aa gya. Mai unko bs dekhti gyi aur dekhti gyi aur eventually voh mere top group bn gye. mene kbhi nhi sochta tha ki koi aur group mere top group banege pr yeh ho gya. mera support seventeen ke liya brta gya aur brta gya. mere phle group ki baat kre toh voh mere first kpop group the isliye mai bhut inexperienced thi aur mujhe lgta tha ki voh best hai even though mene kbhi dusre groups ko suna nhi tha. abh mai sbse first group ko follow nhi krti hou, unka music mujhe suit nhi hota pr mai thankful hou kyuki agr mene unhe kbhi follow nhi kiya hota toh mujhe seventeen ke bre mai kbhi pta nhi chlta. Seventeen ko follow krte hue yeh mera 3rd saal hai, intne time mai mene bhut sre groups ko follow krna suru kr diya hai aur mai ek kpop group bn chuki hou, pr ktine bhi group ko follow kro seventeen mera hmase top pr rheta hai, koi aur group mukje inti appeal aur khushi nhi deta hai, seventeen sbse pehla aur ek he group hai jisne esa kiya hai. time brta jaa rha hai aur abh kpop ka 4th gen aa chuka hai, mai ek amid and true 3rd gen stan hou aur mujhe 4th gen itni appeal nhi deta, abh bhut hi km groups hai jo mere taste ka music bnate hai, sbke ek hi jese concepts hai aur music bhi jadatar same concept ke hai, saath ma sbh performance aur dance pr jaada focus krte hai toh phir mere liye 4th gen groups ko stan krna muskil hai, jse jse time brega vse vse mera interest kpop se kam ho skta hai, mai ek 3rd gen stan hou aur mere saare groups jo jaate hue dekh bra bura lgta hai, mai itna jaada pyaar aur attention aur kisi gen ko nhi de paungi, pr ek cheez hmse same rhegi, mera pyaar seventeen ke liye. kitna bhi time ho jye mai seventeen ko kbhi nhi chorungi, chahe kucch bhi ho jye seventeen mere fav rhenge, till the last say the name and even after the last say the name, mai inhe support dete rhungi aur kbhi nhi chorne vli, seventeen is my happiness, unhone mujhe bhut sri chize sikhyi, aur mai iskilye bhut thankful hou, mai jese bhi ho ske inhe hmase support dungi, physical merch ke saath bhi, but sadly because of corona i can't, they aren't even being delivered to india, but still I'll support them digitally.

Aku benar benar mengikuti  13 bujang ini pada awal Februari 2016,  sebelumnya hanya melihat sepintas karena mereka pernah mengcover dan menyanyikan dari lagu lagu BEAST sekarang HIGHLIGHT  ( karena mereka adalah group pertama yang ku suka).  Aku tidak gampang menyukai suatu group secara keseluruhannya. Dan Bias pertama Samapi sekarang Lee Dokyeom. ❤️ 
Aku beruntung menemukan kalian group  kedua mungkin tidak ada lagi selain group HIGHLIGHT dan Seventeen yang ku sukai. Tetaplah bertahan dan mendukung mereka. Dan kami harap kalian selalu bersama sebagai SEVENTEEN 🙏❤️",3,2021-05-26T14:59:47Z
@moviesbooksandmusic9458,"I really want to write a letter like the rest of these comments but don't really have a lot of time so I will keep it short.
Dear Seventeen

    Though you don't know who I am and I don't know ya'll personally. You make me feel as if I am loved by this amazingly talented, and supportive family. We all have struggles, some different, some the same. I haven't experienced a lot of things, and the future is scary, but after listing to your songs and watching ya'll, it made me think that even though there are so many uncertain things now and in the future if I am able to continue listening to music from Seventeen and whoever else, it's certain that I will have something to lean on and help bring me up when nothing else can. So many people say that they do it to make the people listing to their music happy and comfortable, but very few actually get that emotion and feeling across to me.Seventeen never fail to do just that. Seventeen you made me a better person inside and out. I thank you with as much sinceraty possible, I hope one day when I'm older and can make a lot of money, Seventeen will still be around and I will get to shower you with love. Even if Seventeen does one day disband, I will support everyone and will forever stand up for these amazing men. Even though it seems impossible to love someone you never met, I love you Seventeen and will continue to love you till the day I die.
              
                                                                        Love,
                                                         A non creepy fan, I realized I sounded kinda weird with the last line but I don't mean it like romantic love.",1,2021-05-26T14:59:46Z

Disaat aku mutusin utk stop stan kpop disitu juga temanku ngerecokin mulu sama video video gose nya svt, jujur pertama risih dipaksa nnton mulu aku kalau pengen stan grup ya harus dari akunya sendiri. Yah bbrp hari aku gabut banget dan at least nyoba nnton video svt dan udah mutusin ngestan sejak nnton Seventeen di weekly idol, mereka berbakat banget, bobrok nggak jaim fandomnya damai, sering ngasi saran dan nasihat juga ke carat, pokokny ngga nyesal sekalipun udh ngestan seventeen, makasi udh nyembuhin luka aku sejak bubar nya X1, dan jadi the Last Home.

@yolaarindra1615,"I don't how to start this 'letter' to Seventeen. Should I start from when I stan them or why I love them? Well, I have known them from Home era. I was mesmerised by their triple barrel turn. I've been into K-pop from 2nd gen and it was the first time I see a group that can dance perfectly. From then on, I let them into my life. Even though I have been into k-pop for years, but it was the first time I wanted to stan a specific group.  I had always thought I was a multifan, but since I know them, I'm not. I never thought I want to buy an album or go to a concert, but now, I did, for Seventeen. It's really funny if I look back. 

They really change my life. I don't think I can remember how I was before I met Seventeen. . Now they are a part of my life. 

When I think about why I love them, I had already fallen for them. 
They are my youth.

Thank you. Let's be together from now on too. Love you.",1,2021-05-26T14:57:34Z

Watching Mansae mv back to 5 years ago never giving me a thought that Carats will be the longest home I'll staying at, and I never planned to moved to any home eversince I knew you guys. For this 5 years I've fallen to deep into your guys, I did sheds tears during your first win. I'm used to babied Dino a lot back then and who's thought my baby already grew up into well defined man. ❤️🥺 I wish we could stay for another 50 years, together and I promises I'll stay at this home till then.

@azkaarina7027,"Ini pertama kali banget komen di youtube. Liat carats indo pada rame ucap apresiasi buat cowo-cowo hebat ini. Selamat 6 tahunnya yaa my boys...
Tahun 2017, MV Pinwheel yg baru rilis menemukan jalannya di berandaku. Aku yg waktu itu lagi ngerasa berat tapi sok kuat gamau ngaku lagi susah. Meleleh air mata di part nya Woozi 
""먼 훗날 너에게
미안하지 않게
늘 난 기다릴래 그래
그게 더 맘 편해"". 
Buat aku ngerasa bahwa ada yg nunggu aku melewati masa susah, mau seberapa banyak terjatuh. Dan kini aku bangga sama diriku yg bisa ngakuin overwhelming emotion kala itu. 
Beruntung banget dipertemukan kembali dengan Seventeen, yg buat aku nerima diriku sendiri dan gak nyerah hingga bisa sampai di saat ini.

Pinwheel, comfort song aku baik pas sedih, susah maupun bahagia. Pengingat kalo harus terus berjuang agar aku di masa depan gak menyesal dan kecewa pada diri sendiri. Belajar untuk nerima semua emosi yg aku rasakan baik positif atau negatif, apapun itu masih tetaplah aku. Penentram bahwa aku gak sendiri, pantas untuk bahagia dan semua akan baik-baik saja.

Buat temen2, ngakuin kalo kamu lagi gak apa2 itu juga salah satu bentuk self love. Jangan suka dipendem aja, you accept it and life will get better. 

Big love buat seventeen yg udh bersamaku di perjalanan self love ini.

I don't know if it's too late to tell...
Happy  6th Anniversary Seventeen 🎉🎉
Seventeen was the first group that made me into the Kpop world
I just want to thank you for making my day full of joy with your song🤗. To tell the truth I get to know about Seventeen because my sister forced me to stream Seventeen MV called BOOM BOOM😅. Honestly, at first, I feel annoyed because my sister forced me😑 to keep streaming then time passes I started to like them and their song and of course I want to know more about them🥰. It's funny, right? I got forced from my sister to sister to stream Seventeen's Mv then I started to love them. I want to thank you again for Seventeen, your song helps me a lot, and Of course, I did not forget to thank my fellow CARAT, you guys are kind and sporting. I hope you guys still do what you all do. We will still support you guys no matter where you are. We still love you. I'm crying now 😭😭😭it's been 5 years since I started to stan Seventeen...I'm getting older😅  I'm sorry for my grammar, I tried my best🙆‍♀️. LOVE YOU GUYS ❤.",1,2021-05-26T14:32:25Z
@urgirl6042,"HELLO SEVENTEEN
HAPPY 6th ANNIVERSARY.
ini kali pertama aku ngerayain 6th anniversary nya seventeen sebagai carat❤️ pertama kali aku msk dunia kpop waktu tahun 2017 dan itu aku blm kenal svt. aku stop smua hal tentang kpop tahun 2019 awal. trus tahun 2020 baru mau stan svt karna liat GoSe episode yg THE TAG. Kesan pertama buat svt itu membernya asikkk parahh, kek blom pernah liat kpop boy grup yang sePURE asik nya kayak svt. So mulai dari situ aku ngestan svt. tiap hari denger smua lagunya. nyesel banget baru kenal svt sekarang :( pas tau svt, hidup ku kek berubah banget. jarang banget murung, stres karna tgs, dll karna buat aku svt itu kyk ‘my life’ nya aku. trus fandom nya humble bgtt. carats baikk bangett. fandom ter-calm sihh.
buat seventeen makasih banget uda nyiptain semua lagu yang bagusssss bangettt, content yg always bikin ketawa, pokoknya semuaaaa nyaa...
makasiiiii bangetttttt buat kerja keras kalian selama debut 6 tahun ini. semoga seventeen bisa tetep barengg buat waktu yang lama❤️🥰

Not me because since then i began to do my own research, downloading your music to my drive then 20s got me hooked i kept playing it on repeat.. Though, i couldn't call myself a fan yet because it wasn't until Mansae that i realized no group made me feel the way you guys do, so yeah ""In my eyes, it's only you, does anyone object?"" [lyric from Mansae lol] and that pretty much sums up my discovery about your discography which becomes the beginning of this amazing delightful journey to better tomorrows with you. And it still amazes that All My Love for you since that moment never seems to lessen with each passing day, how is that possible?

Sebelumnya aku ngga pernah sebahagia ini buat suka sama penyanyi. Selama jadi kepopers dan ngikutin beberapa grup tapi ngga pernah sebahagia ini buat suka sama penyanyi. Bahagia banget bisa jadi carat, dulu inget banget pertama kali nonton seventeen waktu itu aku nonton MV don't wanna cry, dan mulai kepoin seventeen, member pertama yang paling dikenal Vernon karena bule, vernon jd first love ku di seventeen suka bonon mungkin karna gaya bonon pas ngerap lebih santuy. mereka talent banget nyanyi, dance, rap, produksi musik, produksi merch, jadi komedian pokoknya paket komplit. mereka bikin mood naik, pas lagi ada masalah terus liat mereka nyanyi apalagi liat gose jd lupa sama masalah ku. Selama suka seventeen beberapa kali kepoin grup lain tapi tetep aja balik nya ke seventeen, sempet nyesel ga ngikutin mereka dari jaman tembok hijau, tapi gapapa aku bersyukur sekarang udah kenal seventeen. Berasa dapet keluarga baru sama seventeen carat. Pokoknya ga bakal nyesel deh stan seventeen.

I first knew you guys when i first started in highschool, which i was still 14 that time. I was mostly okay with my other likings, and i was always into dancing new choreographies ever since i was a child. When you all came into my life, it's like when a single sandwich got its  final ingredient. Basically when i started stanning this group, i felt really open, happy and comfortable, especially the group and fandom itself.

Estos meses he estado al punto de morir por una enfermedad, para ser sincera ya me sentía muy cansada para seguir aquí por todo lo que he y estoy pasando pero en unos de los momentos que me sentía tan desgastada, me puse a escuchar una y otra vez Don't Wanna Cry y Smile Flower lo que me dio mas fuerza para seguir luchando.

Ustedes me dan fuerza, felicidad, energía y yo simplemente se decir gracias, aunque ustedes se merecen más que un simple gracias, ustedes se merecen la felicidad, la tranquilidad y una buena salud por toda la vida.

Karena udah jenuh banget, nggak ada yg bisa dinikmati pas lama suka yg berbau kipop. Rasanya hambar aja sepi, yang diputer ya lagu-lagu lama. Belum lagi pas hektik-hektiknya kuliah. Udah yakin nggak bakal ada yg bikin diri ini suka sama grup baru lagi. Eh taunya, bisa-bisanya sekali liat 13 bocils udah hapal nama dalam satu hari. Bisa-bisanya masih bisa keterusan sampai sekarang. Nggak kerasa ikutan 6 tahun juga sekarang 😂 makasih ya bocils. Asam garam manis gula udah dilewatin, rasanya kaya ngebesarin anak. Sekarang, masa depan yg nggak akan pernah diketahui, raihlah. Sekarang, melihat dari belakang kalian pun, aku senang dan tenang. Langkah apapun di masa sana, lalui dengan baik dan bahagia. So do i.

Aku fans dari tembok hijau. 6 tahun Anniversary untuk seventeen, tapi untuk aku 8 tahun sudah terlewat. 
Bangga banget kalau inget bagaimana perjuangan kalian untuk debut. 
Tapi ga bakal bohong ada perasaan khawatir menyelimuti saat kalian debut. Aku takut kalian ga dikenal publik dan aku pengen publik tau kalau kalian itu jauh lebih hebat dari yang mereka pikirkan.
Sampai akhirnya kalian jadi grup Kpop pertama dimana aku rela nabung berbulan-bulan untuk beli album. Album 17carat yg masih terpajang di lemari, dan sekarang nunggu album keluaran kalian yg terbaru. 
Walaupun sempet rest karna kesibukan kuliah, pada akhirnya aku balik lagi ke fandom ini.

They have made me laugh soo much for these past weeks and I’m so grateful for that. I have always been impressed by their talent but never took the chance, until this year to finally get to know the members, so I do know how talent each member but wow they’re personality did come as surprise. They have some of the best personalities in the industry and I hope they continue to be humble and shine brightly as they have been doing for this past 6 years. Happy Anniversary Seventeen!

You've been together for more than 6 years, I've been with you for five years and these have been the best 5 years. I think I grew up with you, I believe it was my destiny to meet you; I met you in a difficult time in my teens.
Every time I see tour older stuff, I can't help but fesl nostalgic (even if I didn't take part since the beginning). You have made my daus better since I met you.
Thank you. The only words I can say whenever I see you. Thank you for all of the beautiful moments you gave me. Thank you for all of your music. Thank you for being my comfort. Thank you for being part of my life. Thank you SEVENTEEN.

@sarirachas,"Dear Seventeen, Happy 6th Anniversary. I have gone on a roller coaster of emotions this year. Finding new emotions that I didn't even know existed in me. I can not express in words how much you've helped me this year. This one song helped me so much in my lowest time in life. It comforts me and I can not thank you enough for that. All the 13 of you made me laugh, cry, and... i dont know many emotions bare with me (^-^;) but you made me feel a lot.

Your music may not be in a language I understand but the emotions in them I do. And you're song made me cry (in a good way) when I thought I'd never cry for a song. It made me feel so many emotions and made me dance :]

You all deserve so much, so much more than the world could ever give, for the impact you've made on everyone.

@lemonfestive,"to my dearest seventeen,
jujur aku baru pertama kali komen di video kalian pake b.indo (biasanya pake bhs inggris). Aku, yang hanya setitik dari ribuan carat di dunia. kalian mungkin gak kenal atau jg gak tau aku idup hahah. Tapi, aku selalu dukung kalian. gak terasa udah hampir 4 tahun aku jadi carat dan waktu yang udah aku lewatin selama di fandom ini penuh dengan warna. Lagu2 kalian selalu berhasil buat aku setidaknya berpikir kalau semua akan baik-baik saja. Aku inget banget lagu pertama yang aku dengerin itu very nice dan mv pertama yang aku tonton dont wanna cry. waktu itu aku belum nge stan tapi dari awal aku udh ngerasa kalau kalian ini gak biasa dan akhirnya jd hardcore fans sampe sekarang. Aku gak pernah berpartisipasi banyak dan merasa kalau apa yg aku kasih gak akan cukup. Sama kayak lagu ini :)) Tapi y'all know what? apa yang kalian kasih utk carat selama ini udah lebih dari cukup. Carat cuma pengen kalian bahagia dan sama-sama sampe tua. So, if something doesn't come out right or the world goes against you just remember that we will always be there for you all.

@sevesthetic,"Hai sebong, seventeen.

Jujur dari dulu saya ga pernah tertarik sama k-pop, saya prefer anime dan jejepangan. Tapi begitu masuk sma, semua temenku itu k-popers jadi seiring waktu saya kebawa. Saya bner bner gatau apa apa ttg k-pop jd semua yg saya lihat dr temen saya stan. Iya, saya sempet jadi multifandom tapi belum jadi carat. Jujur, saya gabisa hafal anggotanya waktu itu, karena nama korea susah susah. Saya baru jadi carat waktu mv DWC rilis, iya 2017 dan saya nyesel. Padahal sama temen udh dikenalin dr 2015 tapi gak saya gubris, saya nyesel bgt. Soalnya dalam 2tahun itu banyak hal yg saya lewatin dari kalian. Saya jadi multifandom sampe lulus sma dan karena makin kesini sibuk sama kerjaan, pelan pelan saya jd ninggalin k-pop dan kembali ke anime (karena udh lepas dr temen sma juga jd gaada temen hype k-pop lagi). Semua fandom berhasil saya lepas tapi ternyata buat seventeen ga berhasil. Hiburan saya sekarang cuma bner"" dari kalian sama anime. Kalian, orang"" yang saya sayang lebih dari diri sendiri. Kalo bisa saya mau berterimakasih sama temen SMA saya yg sudah ngenalin svt ke saya. 

Dari dulu, sekarang ataupun nanti saya ga mau lepas kalian. Seventeen ttep satu satunya yg saya stan dari k-pop. Walaupun bukan boygrup yg saya stan pertama kali, tapi saya bisa pastiin kalo kalian jadi yang terakhir.

Untill the last saythename, i'll be there stand for you all. Beside you and always with you. Even if the world against you, i'll be carat forever.

Terimakasih banyak karena sudah hadir dihidup saya. Sampai saya tua nanti, saya pengen ceritain kalian ke anak cucu. Biar mereka tau seberarti apa seventeen dihidup saya. Sekali lagi, terimakasih❤💎💎",11,2021-05-26T13:56:27Z

@nnaacc217,내 사랑이 겨우 이거밖에 안된다는 말로 사랑에 보답하면 그 동안 받은게 너무 커서 다 품기도 버거워 하는 캐럿들에게 너무 큰 감동이고 눈물이야 그 마음 알겠어서 나도 내가 겨우 이거 밖에 못해줘서 안타까울 때가 참 많은데 우리의 마음을 너희가 같이 느낀다는게 고맙기도 하지만 아프기도 하다 우리 서로에게 항상 미안하고 사랑해하지 정말 너무 사랑해서 그 사랑이 너무 깊어서. 다음에는 우리 행복으로 답하자 우린 서로에게 기쁨이니까 내 행복의 이유 세븐틴 사랑해 추억이 즐겁고 지금이 행복하고 미래를 기대하게 만들어주는 나의 소중한 존재들아 늘 응원해 고마워 정말 고마워 모든 순간에 함께하자 같이가자 사랑해❤,0,2021-05-26T13:55:59Z

@defitaj.a2881,"Halo Seventeen, aku Catat dari Indonesia.

Seventeen, Pertama kali suka kalian itu di era Mansae. Aku yang posisi masih bocah waktu itu, langsung suka sama kalian. Ya, walau ngga terlalu ngikutin kalian karena blm punya hp sendiri waktu itu wkwkwk, cuma bisa ngandelin streaming MV pake hp ibu sambil ngumpet2. 

Aku mau minta maaf dan terimakasih sama kalin. Maaf karena aku sempat ninggalin kalian sebentar dan sibuk sama rl aku sampe ngedenger lagu kalian pun ngga. Tapi saat aku lagi terpuruk, jatuh banget, mental aku lagi sakit, kyknya lagu kalian itu kayak obat tersendiri buat aku. 

Kalian yang bener2 jadi penghibur buat aku. Saat aku bener2 tertekan karena harus menjalankan tugas sebagai pemimpin organisasi di sekolah, aku kyk liat Seungcheol mimpin Seventeen. Seungcheol sama Seventeen bnr2 kyk penyelamat aku disaat aku udah mau nyerah sama 'jabatan' dan label pemimpin di nama aku.

Dan sekarang, kondisi aku sudah sangat baik. Salahsatunya berkat kalian yang selalu bikin aku ketawa sama tingkah kalian.

Seventeen, makasih buat semuanya. Ayo kita bersama selamanya. Sehat selalu. Kami bakal selalu ada buat kalian.

All you’re Gose episodes are lots of fun and I always enjoy watching them. We would love to remind you all that we love you very much and will support you till the very end!

I started to know more about the group and started listening to all your songs. I love them all! I can really tell that you’re songs really has sentimental values and that there’s always a message in it that we all carats can understand and learn from it. You all made me happy and joyful, I seriously love all your laughs it is so cute and when you guys laugh you all make me laugh as well.

I will always be your supporter and I wish you all will succeed more in the future with all the hard work you all do. You are all very talented, so don’t let hate affect you because no matter how much haters there are, us carats are more and will always be by your side giving you positivity, strength, love, and encouragement.<3

@Reflexioneaatw,"My love is only this

Hello my joy
Even in deep despair
Always make me laugh By my side
Let me forget everything for a moment

Play a song you know and one step
Hold your hands and put your feet in two steps
To me today
I make you wish for tomorrow

Baby It's alright
Oh It's okay

Knowing all my lies
It's just you, O ah, thank you more

Sometimes tired
When I see you crying with my head down
I don't know what to do, what can I do
I'm really sorry

My love is only this
Thanks for staying by my side though, my baby
Even if my love is only this
Any winter, it will be your spring
My heart barely says this

Like a pouring meteor shower
Be a light in the black sky
I can do everything for you
I am to you

I only want to givе anything and everything
I'm getting smallеr, a fool who only accepts
I hate myself
I'm even more sorry for you

Baby It's alright
Oh It's okay

Knowing all my lies
It's just you, O ah, thank you more

Sometimes tired
When I see you crying with my head down
I don't know what to do, what can I do
I'm really sorry

My love is only this
Thanks for staying by my side though, my baby
Even if my love is only this
Any winter, it will be your spring
My heart barely says this

Hardly my heart
Only this song and lyrics
For you for you for you for you

Sing this song for you Tonight
So I can approach your love

My love is only this
But my heart won't change, only for you baby
Even if my love is only this
I'll become your umbrella in the rain
I'll protect you on all your days",0,2021-05-26T13:48:19Z

@Izipizilemonsquizi,"Aku juga mau cerita...
Dulu aku cuma suka kepoin boygroup doang ga sampe ngestan beli album printilan dll...
Trus temen aku ngenalin aku ke seventeen waktu itu dia liatin ke aku dwc sama home emang keren bgt tapi aku ga sampe ngestan langsung karna aku gabisa kalo dipaksa atau disuruhin org gitu, mau nya jalur mandiri, atas kemauan sendiri
Akhirnya setelah nonton knowing bross especially pas soonyoung ngegass pas ditanyain kenapa seventeen anggota nya 13 ga 17, boom waktu itu aku langsung “damn I’m gonna stan this group!!!” Emang aneh sih alasannya tapi yah setelah itu aku langsung terjun bebas jadi carat
Waah asli nyaman bgt, apalagi temen2 carat semuanya pada adem ayem, sabar2 bgt dan ga mudah tersulut, walopun fandom kita ga gede bgt tapi kita itu kompak bgt, apalagi sebongie juga rajin mengedukasi kita buat kalem dan santai aja jangan dengerin kata org luar, aah seneng bgt kaya kita itu cuma mikirin satu sama lain aja lo, mo terjadi badai diluar mo ada kehebohan apa diluar, ya bodo amat...

I found Seventeen after I lose someone I cherish the most on my whole life . Every single of them means a lot for me . They are the reason why I still alive after attempting suicide several times . They are the reason why I keep going . They are the main contributor of my achievements now . I know they see us the Carats as an ocean of  stars in dark night , untouchable but they know very well that we exist .
I'll stay untill the last 'Say The Name' . 
My dear Seventeen members , 
Thank you for debuting .

@rxsequarts16,"Dear Seventeen. (Walaupun kalian gak akan baca ini ㅋㅋㅋ)
Aku kenal kalian dari temen aku, k-popers garis keras juga. Dia kenalin kalian ke aku dan teman-teman aku yang lain di tahun 2017. MV pertama yg aku nntn ""Pretty U"" mulai dari MV itu aku langsung nge-stan kalian,  bias aku Mingyu. Sampai sekarang. Aku belajar hafal nama-nama kalian, susah. Susah banget. Karena kalian 13 orang, ganteng, bertalenta, lucu, moodbooster. Seiring berjalannya waktu, aku jadi sayang sama kalian semua. Semuanya.

Terima kasih yah, sudah menjadi boygroup yang hebat. Dengan musik kalian yang luar biasa. Yang selalu menjadi diri kalian sendiri. Dengan warna kalian masing-masing. 
Aku bangga jadi salah satu CARAT.

Happy 6th Anniversary SEVENTEEN!
I LOVE YOU ❤🇮🇩",6,2021-05-26T13:45:56Z

If you really don't want to and you want to be banned, go ahead but it hurts, I don't want to lie that I'm okay if you get banned. I Love You Sebongs. Happy 6th Anniversary.




Seventeeen, Happy 6 주년 My Love. 내가 아는 당신은 여전히 ​​열일곱입니다. 사랑해 세븐틴. 내 댓글이 안보여도 plss가 해체되지 않았 으면 좋겠어요. 캐럿을 행복하게 해주셔서 많은 캐럿이 아파 질 테니까요. 내가 우는 것을보고 나는 미친 듯이 웃고있다. 정말로 원하지 않고 금지 당하고 싶다면 계속 진행하지만 아파요, 금지 당해도 괜찮다고 거짓말하고 싶지 않습니다. 사랑해 세봉. 6 주년을 축하합니다.",2,2021-05-26T13:40:29Z

Gracias por hacer el tipo de música que hacen, últimamente me he encontrado con que los 20 son una edad confusa, pero con cada canción no solo me encuentro identificada, sino que también encuentro un abrazo donde puedo descansar y tomar la energía para poder seguir con el día a día.
Sus voces, su amor y su pasión han logrado que no me rinda, que descubra mis pasiones una y otra vez para que mi camino no se sienta tan solo ni tan pesado.
Estoy agradecida con Dios por haberme encontrado con su música y con ustedes.

@MinSuga-hi1he,"Thank you seventeen for everything youve done for us carats. I haven’t known this group for long but I immediately got pulled in when I watched one of your going episodes. You’ve become one of my people who lift me up when I’m sad or angry. Your songs are beautiful and have so much meaning and it’s just such a pleasure to hear them. Thank you for all the time you guys spend to make us happy. I’m proud of y’all and I can’t wait to be here till them end because I promise you I’ll be here until the end and even after the end I’ll never stop being a carat until the day I die. You’ve made such an impact in my life and taught me many things through music. And you each individual taught me different things. 

Scoups - taught me how to be a strong leader 
Jeonghan - how to break gender standards where I live
Joshua - taught me how to be kind 
Jun - how to have fun and be silly in the moment
Hoshi - to be passionate about what I love 
Wonwoo- to find people/friends who help you get out your shell and speak up 
Woozi- taught me how to put emotions in things like lyric writing 
Dk- taught me how to smile and have fun 
Mingyu - 
Minghao - taught me better fashion and to be passionate about whatever your doing small or big or something you love 
Seungkwan - taught me how to make people laugh and also how to be sassy but most importantly he taught me to love my family more 
Vernon - taught me it’s okay to be chill and relaxed and it’s okay to be that way 
Dino- taught me to never give up and try your best to go down in history and make a name for yourself 

All of these things have made a huge impact on my life and how I am. That’s it’s okay to be the way I am and to find people who love me and help me become a better person. Everyday it might not be easy but knowing I can go home and listen to seventeen or watch their videos it makes my day 100 percent better then it started. Also as a carat I want you to know that other carats and I only want the best for you and to be yourself that we love the way you are personally and individually. That don’t listen to the haters and stay strong don’t go on diet because you think you need to look better don’t change your person because you think you need to be better don’t force yourself to do something for us because who ever you are each individually we love you for that and the uniqueness you all bring to the group real carats love you for any way you look act and are. So please never change that. I love you guys so much and you mean a lot to me so please stay healthy and strong and I hope one day I can attentive down your concert in real life and met the people I look up to. Happy 6th anniversary I love you guys so much. Enjoy your anniversary ❤️❤️❤️",14,2021-05-26T13:30:29Z

Since then I started to be able to smile and even laugh out loud because of your behavior. And, thank God I recovered from my illness and can follow my activities again.

Terimakasih selama ini kalian udh buat hari-hari ku selalu semangatt. Cerita sedikit, jadi awal aku tau sebong di tahun 2015 waktu mereka awal debut. Tapi, di tahun itu aku belum tertarik sama sekali sama dunia kpop. Tibalah suatu hari, aku liat mv sebong 'oh my!' aku jadi penasaran dan mulai ngestalk sebong. Mv 'boom boom' buat aku jatuh cinta bgt sama sebong dan mulai dari situ aku mulai ngikutin perkembangan sebong. Mungkin aku bisa dibilang bukan carat dari tembok ijo, tapi aku akan jadi carat sampai 'the last say the name' dan bakal dukung sebong terus karena emg udh sesayang itu sama mereka. Berapa kalipun aku oleng ke grup lain, tapi ga pernah tahan lama kaya sebong. Emg ya pelet sebong kuat bgt:') Terimakasih juga carat yang selalu apresiasi semua karya"" sebong dan selalu support sesama fandom. Sehat-sehat terus yaa sebong dan carat!

@yustinaardena6477,"Sebenernya SVT bukan grup kpop pertama yang aku kenal, tau, dan stan, tapi SVT grup kpop pertama yg bikin aku ngerasain seneng, sedih, asik, seru, heboh tiap nonton konten mereka(😂). Bener bener baru banget jadi Carat jalur PSBB grgr corona. Di rumah doang jd diracunin SVT sm temen. MV pertama yang ditonton DWC dan bener bener bikin fall in love (asik). Bener bener lgsg naksir, dari situ ngepoin varshownya mereka sampe semua lagu dan tingkah mereka. Bener bener jadi nggak bisa keluar dari fandom ini, carat asik banget, adem, damai, seru, baik baik semua. Dan karena ngestan SVT, online class dan PSBB di rumah aja jadi jauh lebih asik dan seru. Semenjak ngestan SVT juga jadi punya banyak temen carat baru yang baik baik dan asik semuaa. Walo skrg tergolong baby carat, tp nanti (bbrp tahun kedepan) aku bakal tetep jadi carat yg bertransformasi jadi old carat buat para baby carat nantinya. Maksud aku, walau aku telat banget tau, kenal, dan suka sama mereka tapi aku bakal terus sama mereka di masa depan bareng semua carat yang sama kayak aku dengan tujuan yang tulus buat SVT. Happy 6th Anniversary SEVENTEEN dan terima kasih untuk semua carat yang udah bareng bareng sama SVT dari jaman tembok ijo ataupun buat yg baby carat (kyk aku) sampe sekarang, ayo bareng bareng lagi di tahun tahun kedepan❤❤❤",9,2021-05-26T13:24:22Z

You're really a gift to the world, I'm really glad to have idols like SEVENTEEN, You're not only my pride but they're also an example and an inspiration to me; SEVENTEEN has shown me a lot of things, you've inspired me and showed me a little light on the way, you will never see this, but thank you for being by my side all this time, you've filled the unbearable silence in my head with wonderful lyrics and warm sounds that were kept in my heart.

Terima kasih ya untuk segala kebahagiaan yang kalian bagi bersama kami CARATs... Terima kasih juga karena di saat sedih pun kita bisa saling bercerita dan menguatkan.

Meskipun jalan yang dilalui seringkali sulit bahkan terkadang rasanya hampir ingin menyerah, namun berkat lagu-lagu dan kehangatan yang kalian bawa.. banyak Carat yang akhirnya bisa bertahan dan melewatinya.

Sekali lagi, terima kasih...
Semoga kita tetap bersama sampai waktu yang sangat panjang, sampai akhir 'Say The Name'

INI CERITA DARI SUDUT PANDANG GUA YAH GUYS.. DAN JUGA INI GUA SUSAH CARA NGASIH TAU KEKALIAN NYA GIMANA... MOGA KALIAN NGGAK KAYAK GUA YAH

kenalin aku Alfie... aku mau bagi cerita sama kayak carat lainnya.... aku kenal Sebong itu udah lama dan udah sering juga denger lagu lagu Seventeen dan first mv yang aku tonton itu  ''Thanks'' dan variety show yang aku tonton itu Weekly Idol yang era Thanks, yang jaman Ujik kita jadi peri lemon wkwkkwk.... dan di era itu aku mulai tertarik dengan Seventeen dan aku inget banget disitu aku suka sama 3 orang Ujik, Babeh dan Mingyu.... tapi buat Mingyu aku suka nya ikut ikut doang (karena Kakak aku suka Mingyu).... tapi serius disaat itu aku kagum banget sama Seventeen karena sukses Dance (lupa nama nya) pokok nya Dance yang cepet lambat itu sama Random Dance, sumpah keren banget, aku sampek mikir '' kok bisa mereka dance kompak padahal member nya banyak banget'', tapi waktu aku memang udah tertarik tapi belum memutuskan menjadi Carat... dan singkat cerita waktu aku kelas 10 semester awal (mian kalo salah ) dan diwaktu itu juga Pledis itu di akuisis (?) sama Bighit, aku bingung dan cari tau kenapa tiba tiba Bighit gitu, dan setelah aku tau Pledis itu ent nya Seventeen... disitu aku seneng dong kaget dan keinget waktu dulu aku sempet tertarik sama Seventeen, jadi aku gak sengaja liat MV MV seventeen lainnya, dan dalam beberapa hari aku mau jadi Carat jadi Di IG aku banyak banget Follow Akun  Fansbase Seventeen dan carat... dan gak sengaja aku dapet Link GC disalah satu akun Fanbase nya Seventeen (lupa nama akun fansbase nya) trs aku Join, awal awal aku belum begitu akrab sama mereka semua, karena waktu itu aku lagi asik banget sama RP jadi aku lebih suka main RP..... sampai dimana pas rp aku sepi, aku mulai cari kesibukan dan nggak sengaja aku kepencet sama Notifikasi GC itu yang udah 12K an, iya serius! 12 ribu pesan sari GC itu, asal kalian tau itu adalah Gc paling rame sejagat raya, kalian tau 5 menit kita ninggalin Hp, tanpa kalian sadari kalian udah nabung 1K pesan.... dan saat aku udah mulai bosen dengan Rp dan bener bener berhenti main RP, aku baru sadar kalau anak anak Di Gc itu satu Frekuensi dengan aku, yang bacot dan suka rada rada gitu.... kalian pernah gak ngebayangin di suatu Gc fandom kalian itu, kalian bisa ngomong random, pap foto random, main game mapiah, VN tiap malam dalam satu waktu??? bisa dibayangin betapa ramenya Gc itu kan??... aku masih inget banget kenangan indah sama sahabat sahabat online ku itu, Kadal, Kanu, Aca, Ipi, nida, ndil, ayu, acer,michel Dlll kita itu paling berisik di Gc, sampai suatu malam Kadal buat Gc dengan anak anak yang dia anggap udah kenal banget (termasuk gua) disitu perlahan Gc utama rada sepi karena orang orang bacot udah Pw di Gc giba itu... awal nya kadal buat karena buat kick orang aja, tapi anak anak yg dia kick itu bikin Gc juga buat kick dia, jadi inti nya kita buat Gc baru dan Kick satu sama lain, sampai dimana Gc itu tiba tiba jadi Gc giba... dan kalian tau nggak sangking akrabnya, mereka tau sesuatu rahasia hidup gua yang bahkan sahabat RL gua itu gak ada yang tau... Jadi waktu itu pas Era Heng: grae itu datang disitu Juga Era dimana gua bener bener harus berusaha buat nggak Stres dan depresi karena KDRT... jadi gua itu besar dan tinggal di dusun plosok di Sumsel dan gua ada kesempatan buat Tinggal sama Kakak pertama gua di Serang Banten.. yahhh kalian tau bulan awal itu pasti semua orang belum menunjukan sifat asli mereka dan sampai dimana gua udah di tahun pertama gua tinggal sama mereka, so udah wajar kan seseorang nunjukin sifat asli mereka kalau udah 1 tahun tinggal satu rumah... DISINI GUA BAKALAN CERITA DI SUDUT PANDANG GUA JADI GUA GAK TAU KALAU DARI SUDUT PANDANG DIA ITU BAGAIMANA. YANG PASTI BAKALAN BEDA...... jadi ditahun pertama itu yahhh menurut gua sih masih wajar, seorang Kakak Ipar memaki adik ipar nya didepan ibu mertua nya sekaligus ibu kandung dari adik ipar dan istri nya, kalian tau nggak apa yg dia maki didepan ibu gua? apa? ''kurang ajar?'' ahhh itu mah biasa, tapi kalau '' SETAN, JIN DAJJAL, BABI, ANJING'' gimana? udah biasa tau luar biasa untuk seorang menantu laki laki yang berumur lebih 30 tahun memaki adik ipar nya didepan ibu mertua nya?.... kata makian itu memang tertuju khusus untuk gua yang sedang main sama anak anak nya, bahkan waktu itu juga dia pernah ngajarin anak nya buat ngatain gua ''PEMALAS''.... kalian pasti nanya kenapa dia bisa gitu? pasti ada sebapnya? iya dong masa nggak.. jadi singkat ceita yah.. kakak gua itu ternyata hamil diluar rahim, jadi kek janin nya itu nggak dirahim gitu, jadi dia harus dirawat dirumah sakit, so singkat cerita lagi, waktu itu gua pulang dari sekolah dan dirumah itu ada adik? temen? eh gak tau pokok nya kek temen tapi udah dianggap adik sendiri ama dia karena satu daerah... kita panggil Kak S aja yah... jadi kak S itu bilang kegua yang baru balik sekolah kalo Kakak J ( nama kakak ipar yang sangat baik hati itu:).... dia bilang kalau gua disuruh kerumah sakit (BTW rumah sakit nya kagak jauh) nah jadi gua kerumah sakit tuh TANPA NYAPU DAN NGEPEL DULU ( BTW gua itu seharusnya nyapu ngepel 2 kali sehari, pagi sebelum sekolah dan sore setelah balik sekolah tapi kalau sore kakak cewek gua gak sering nyapu pel duluan, karena takut lakinya balik trs rumah blm dipel atau di sapu karena gua belum balik sekolah) yoo balik kecerita!!... dan gua mikir kan ada Kakak S dan istrinya toh, dan gua kira dia bakalan pengertian buat gantiin gua untuk nyapu pel rumah selagi gua di rumah sakit... jadi gua ke RS tuh yah gantian jagain kakak gua yang sakit dan Kakak J itu balik tuh kerumah dan cuman ada emak, gua sama kakak gua tuh, sampai emak gua bilang kalau gua disuruh jagain kakak gua malem itu... sumpah demi apa gua kaget banget, gua disuruh jagain kakak gua satu malem dan sedangkan besok ada ujian, gua bilang dong kagak mau, dan mikir ''kenapa harus gua?'' padahal suaminya ada dan suami nya itu berangkat kerja lebih telat daripada gua berangkat sekolah.... singkat cerita lagi jadi mak gua mulai pegi dan gua? gua mulai nangis karena nggak mau.. jadi gua itu  nangis yahhhh lumayan lama lah yah, tanpa gua sadari kakak gua itu lagi telponan sama laki dia yahhh dan gua kira laki dia denger gua lagi nagis... jadi gak lama gua nangis suster Rs itu dateng dan bilang kakak gua udh boleh balik (kebetulan kali bukan?) jadi gua sama kakak gua itu mulai ngeringkes barang barang sampai dimana laki dia sekligus kakak ipar paling lemah lembut itudatang sama si Kakak S jemput... nah ini  nih bagian menarik, jadi pas dimobil gua udah berasa kagak enak nih ama situasi itu, trs tiba tiba kakak Ipar the best itu nyeletuk ''' ngapo kau dak galak kawani ayuk kau?'' dia tannya tuh dan gua diem aja trs dia lanjut tuh '' kalau dak galak ngawani itu dak usah dateng ke Rs'' nah udah aneh nih kan yak... trs trs dia itu kek nyeritain kalau dia yang nyapu pel rumah karena gua blm nyapu pel rumah, dah tuh dia mulai marah ngatain gua senggaja kerumah sakit uat kagak ngepel nyapu, padahal nggak begono yang terjadi sebenarnya... disitu gua balik nangis yahhh kalian tau kan kalo orang palembang itu ngomong aja keke ngegas apalagi kalo lagi marah plus jengkel.... disitu gua nangis sampai pas mau bayar parkir dia minta uang 2 ribu buat bayar parkir sama si istrinya buttttt si istrinya itu nggak punya uang kecil dan gua mengingat saat siang tadi gua beli Mie ayam sama kakak gua goput total 48 ribu dan gua ngasih 50k dan kebalian 2 rebu (kebetulan lagi bukan?) nah jadi awalnya gua berniat baik hati dan memberinya 2 rebu itu dia minta lagi trs karena gua kira dia minta 2 rebu lagi dan dengan polos gua jawab ''' dak kate lagi, ini 10 ribu duit sokongan '' ( btw pas disekolah itu tadi siang gua ada jam olah raga jadi minggu kemaren ibu guru itu ada bilang kolo disuruh bawa bola kasti  nah berhubung karena banyak kejadian diluar dugaan, gua lupa dan terpaksa hrs minjem bolah kekelas sebelah sam temen gua yg kagak bawa juga nahhh singkat cerita karena keasikan mukul bola gua kagak sengaja bikin tuh bola pecah, pecahnya sih nggak kek pecah yg pecah parah gitu, cuman kek beda aja rasanya dan juga bola nya emang yang jelek gitu bola temen temen gua juga banyak yang pecah karena disatu toko beli nya tpi yg beda toko nggak kok aman aman aja, nah jadi gua ama temen gua itu merasa bersalah dan mau gantiin besok jadi kita patungan 5k 5k tuh dan kenapa bisa kebawa? karena gua ke RS pakek celana olah raga dan gua juga niat nya mau sekalian beli bola ehhhh ternyata kagak kebeli).... nah dia marah tuh karena gua bilang itu bukan duit gua trs selama perjalanan kerumah, dia ngatain gua perhitungan, kagak tau malu dan bahkan bilang kalau gua kagak boleh tidur dirumah eh dikamar dia bilang buat tidur di teras, singkat cerita setelah masukin barang barang gua kekamar gua tuh nennangin diri gua sambil nutupin muka gua ama bantal, disitu gua lupa ada emak gua apa nggak jadi intinya dia ngomong gini '' nah kan nah ku bilang, ngapoi kau dikamar, kan dah ku suruh dito di luar sano, di teras'' trs bla bla dan diakhiri dengan '' katek malu!'' (kaga ada malu itu katanya).. nangis dong gua dan dipagi hari seperti biasa gua bangun jam 4 menghindari bertemu dengan dia pas beres beres trs pas gua dikamar buat ganti baju sekolah, disitu posisi nya dia udah bangun tuh yah... gua tuh udah tau kalau situasi begini tuh biasanya dia bakalan",27,2021-05-26T13:16:15Z

@AR-vh9pe,"Dear SEVENTEEN,
         Thank you for everything. You may not know I exist, still, thank you. You helped me a lot. From focusing on my study, encouraging me to do more and to go far, and you all helped me when I am stressed and battling with my anxiety. You helped me by your music and its message. 
         I've been a Carat since August 25/26 last year, but I felt like I was in this diamond world for so long. I'm a bit down this month since there are so many bad things happening to me. But, I guess, I were just too lucky that I have your songs downloaded in my gadget, and can atleast understand some of it. 
         So, thank you, really, for everything. I hope I could see you all up close and have a proper conversation where we can understand each other's feelings and emotions. Help me more on the future, I'll help you too to reach the goal, together. 
          Again, thank you for everything. And, goodnight

@bajjj4056,"Honestly i was aware of them since seventeen tv era but didnt really pay much attention to them after debut. What finally made me slip and submerge right into the diamond life was, ironically, One Fine Day haha! From there i refamiliarized with them, and although sometimes i do pay more attention to other groups (being a multi is hard work lol), i dont think i'll ever stop being a carat. No matter what, I'll always come back to SVT because they're amazing, talented, genuine people. 

I dont think my adoration for SVT will ever fade away, even 20 years down the road. 20 years from now i'll still remember these 13 dorks or listen to their music and it'll put a smile on my face and a warmth in my heart.

So i guess i just wanted to say; Thank you for being such a big part of my youth, and thank you for being a part of all my love at this moment in my life.

But thats how lovable, caring, and open you guys are to me and all the other carats😭🖤 Thats why i felt like i've made a longtime friend already with you guys.

When I was at my lowest, when I was hurting, when I was thinking of jumping from high places where were you? Even though I couldn’t talk to SEVENTEEN and they probably don’t even know I exist, they saved me. Their songs, lyrics pulled me out of the pits of darkness but you? You just went with your day, even though u say that I matter to you. I “mattered” to you yet you did nothing to help, you didn’t even ask if I was okay when you saw how bad I was hurting. But SEVENTEEN, even though they don’t know who I am they saved me, helped me. So don’t you dare say anything about them when they literally saved me from suicide. Stanning SEVENTEEN was not really stanning, it was like having someone always there actually caring about me. They’re not just another kpop group.

this is why i love svt. it's like they know every carat even if they don't see us personally anymore. like they know what they want and they're willing to do it and give it to us at the perfect time.

i met svt 4 years ago and there was never a boring day in caratland. it was full of laughters, smiles, and even tears but it's all worth it. with them, everything is worth it. happy 6th anniv uri sebongs! thank you so much for being our home.",1,2021-05-26T12:57:32Z

when the right time came which is left & right era, i didn't hesitate to look out for the song & play it all-day long & that made me look out for the group & it's because of mingyu 💙, since then when my friend ask me who i think would be my bias, i always answer it's mingyu & luckily, he was the one who made me stan them & know them furthermore & that's why i'm very very thankful for him.

i heard a lot about them before especially their songs & now, as day goes by, i'm slowly knowing them individually & now i can prove to myself that i'm really a carat 💎 there are a lot of times when i feel like i'm not belong to the fandom but to be honest, it's not important if you don't know them individually, what's more important is you are welcomed by carats & you know you are loved by seventeen ✨

i, thank seventeen for everything, they are one of my sources of inspiration, they make me smile whenever i'm having a hard time, & same goes as twice (my other ultimate group), it's impossible not to be carat, just by their music, you'll feel relaxed & they will help you overcome how hard you're experiencing.

thank you SEVENTEEN! it's been 6 years, i'm proud of all of you! 💝

Even though i’ve only been with Seventeen for barely a year it feels like i’ve watched you guys ever since pre-debut. I cant express how much you guys have helped me without even knowing. Im usually very sad, and done, but you have helped me; whenever I feel down your music, and content always motivate me to keep living, it helps me more than people think. I’ve shed enough tears watching, and listening to you, I think it’s enough to fill a kiddy pool; and I’ve laughed enough to make my stomach hurt. You guys are the reason I feel motivated to live, Seventeen & Carats are truly 1 in 7 billion... I can’t even express myself correctly in words nor in actions, but I hope I can make my message clear. Keep Going! 💎🥕",2,2021-05-26T12:54:50Z

안녕, 나의 기쁨이여
깊은 절망에도
항상 웃게 해 by my side
잠시 모든 걸 잊게 해 줘

아는 노랠 틀고 one step
두 손을 잡고 발을 two step
어느새 오늘의 나에게
내일의 널 바라게 해

Baby it's alright
Oh it's okay

내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라, oh ah 더 고마워

가끔은 지쳐
고개 숙여 우는 널 볼 때
어쩔 줄 모르는 난 뭘 할 수 있을까
정말 미안해

내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 고마워 my baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해

쏟아지는 유성우처럼
까만 하늘에 빛이 돼 줘
I can do everything for you
난 너에게

뭐든지 다 주고 싶은 마음만 커서
작아지는 나는 받기만 하는 바보
어느새 내가 미워서
너에게 더욱 미안해

Baby it's alright
Oh it's okay

내 거짓말 다 아는 건
너뿐이라, oh ah 더 고마워

어쩔 줄 모르는 난 뭘 할 수 있을까

그래도 내 곁에 있어 줘서 고마워 my baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
어느 겨울에도 너의 봄이 될게
내 마음이 겨우 이런 말 해

어렵게 내 마음 적은
이 노래와 가사뿐이지만
For you, for you, for you, for you

이 노랜 널 위해 불러 tonight
네 사랑에 다가갈 수 있게

내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼
그래도 내 마음은 변치 않아 너에게만 baby
내 사랑이 겨우 이것밖에 안 돼도
비 내리는 너의 우산이 돼 줄게
지켜줄게 너의 모든 날에",0,2021-05-26T12:54:14Z

Together, we made memories that i will never forget and i really want to be here, making new memories, bad ones or good ones.

@hqidssjf,입덕을 겪은 16살의 중학생이 어느덧 22살의 대학생이 되어서 6주년을 함께 하고 있네. 내 학창시절엔 항상 세븐틴이 있었고 앞으로의 인생에도 그럴 거야. 이 노래 처음 나왔을 때도 조금 울컥했던 게 난 너무 큰 사랑을 받았고 그건 절대 '겨우'라는 말로 표현할 수 없는 크기야. 그러니 '겨우'라는 표현은 넣어둬. 꿈을 포기하지 않고 지금까지 와준 내 사랑들아 너무 고마워. 앞으로도 함께 같이 걸어가자. 사랑해ᰔ,18,2021-05-26T12:48:56Z

As of now, I can't believe, I mean that is as your loving CARAT, I don't know how to explain what I feel right now in knowing that you've been making music and preparing great choreography for almost (6) six years debuted the KPop Music Industry. I cannot imagine how many times you've been experiencing sleepless nights striving to create and prepare songs and performances a better one, a great one rather. From the moment I've heard your music, it was like a dimensional hole appeared, swept me up and slip me into the diamond life and never to return. I felt that everything inside me shift, in order for me to become part of your fandom. Also from that moment, I knew that you are the ones who gave a lot of happiness and inspirations to me.

Aku sangat mencintai kalian. Walau pesan ini akan sulit tersampaikan, namun diriku tak pernah lelah untuk mengungkapkannya.
Seventeen, terimakasih sudah hadir di hidupku, terimakasih telah memberiku banyak sekali kebahagiaan, terimakasih telah mengajariku banyak hal tentang menghargai orang lain, aku banyak belajar hal-hal yang tidak pernah aku dapatkan sebelum aku mencintai kalian. Jika orang bertanya padaku mengapa aku sangat mencintai kalian, aku akan menjawab, ""Karna Seventeen benar-benar telah mengajariku tentang apa yang disebut dengan 'Cinta, Kebaikan, dan Ketulusan' "". Aku mencintai kalian.
Jangan pernah khawatir tentang hubungan kita, aku percaya kita pasti akan saling mencintai selamanya, kita akan tetap berada di keluarga Seventeen Carats selamanya, meskipun kita masih belum tahu jalan kita di masa depan.  Namun, percayalah, Kami akan melindungi kalian dari semua kesedihan dan jalan yang melelahkan ini karena kami Mencintaimu.

Because of your music, I feel the beauty of the world (friendship, loneliness, love, power, self-confidence, family, inner beauty, encouragement). Because of your encouragement, I'm able to express my emotions. I can say what I wanna say. I can tell people what I really feel. I can be happy by myself. I can encourage myself for doing a step forward for things I'm scared of. I'm afraid to be grateful for small things. Thanks for making my days better every single day.

@kwxnhooniee,"It's been 6 years already.... But most of us know them as much as all those years we've spent not knowing them.. SEVENTEEN, our home, our safe place. Someone who understands you more than anyone could... Someone we feel safe with. Someone we would love and support for our entire lives. Even if they don't remain as a grp somewhere in future, they'll all be the same 13 in our heart. Forever. They may not know that a person like you exist, but they know you as carats. They love you. A lot! They convey it to us thorough songs if words may not be possible..Let's  one proud to be carats and have our boys with us... I shouldnt be getting emotional on a day like this, but ik we can't resist it. Tears may fall off, but that's the tear of all those feelings, all those love you have for them. They've come all the way after the struggles they had to go through. For us... I couldn't include what all I wanted to say, but I want to end with a Thank you note...
To SEVENTEEN,
Thank you. Thank you for always bringing all those stupid smiles on our face. Thank you for always being by our side. Thank you for being our home, our safe place. Thank you for all those hard work you've done for us... Thank you for being our cute crackeheads. Hehe. Thank you for every single thing you've done for all of us carats... Always remebr that we WERE with you, IS with you and will ALWAYS be with you throughout, no matter what!
 We love you a lot.....

SEVENTEEN, THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING, I WILL ALWAYS BE CARAT AND SUPPORT YOU, I PROMISE

Oke, mau ikutan juga bikin surat pendek utk SEVENTEEN..
Mungkin aku tidak mengikuti kalian dari awal dan baru-baru mengenal kalian sekitar 1,5 tahun terakhir ini tapi terima kasih untuk semuanya. Karena kalian, aku jadi kembali ke dunia kpop lagi. Karena kalian, seperti ada alasan dan harapan setiap bangun di pagi hari apalagi di masa-masa sekarang ketika bahkan sulit untuk bertemu teman di real life. Personally, banyak hal terjadi di 2020 dan SEVENTEEN adalah salah satu alasan kenapa aku masih bisa bertahan sampai sejauh ini. 
Percayalah, aku sudah mengenal kpop dari 2011 dan beberapa kali berganti fandom, tapi baru kali ini benar-benar merasa sayang banget dengan group kpop dan merasa sedekat itu dengan kalian, SEVENTEEN dan CARATS, walaupun sebenarnya kalian jauh. I believe that SEVENTEEN and CARATS will always be together, forever. Aamiin.

SEVENTEEN, once again THANK YOU for your music, your content, your personality, your smile and your everything. As Woozi said : ""I want to do these forever with this people"". Yes, please, do it forever and always be together as SEVENTEEN. We, CARATS, also want to do this forever with you, SEVENTEEN :)",0,2021-05-26T12:40:30Z

@ciciokta,"Hai Seventeen, nggak kerasa udah 6th kalian debut dan udah 4th aku nge stan kalian. Sebelum ""kenal"" kalian, aku ga pernah yang namanya fall into a kpop group that much as much as I fall into you guys. Apa ya... kayak ngerasa klik aja gitu sama kalian. Meskipun kita jauh dan mungkin kalian ga pernah tau kalo ada aku yang ngedukung kalian, tapi aku ngerasanya kayak kita deket banget dan kita itu temen sekaligus keluarga.
Inget banget waktu pertama kali dengerin lagu clap di salah satu platform music secara ga sengaja pas lagi perjalanan mau bimbingan skripsi, terus ngerasa addicted sama partnya vernon, and then penasaran dan voilaaa jadilah aku yang sekarang gabisa jauh-jauh sama kalian. Terimakasih banyak karena kalian udah nemenin aku di masa-masa susah maupun senangku. 
Aku sadar, aku gabisa ngasih banyak ke kalian. Tapi satu hal yang aku bisa jamin, aku bakalan terus dukung kalian, sampai kapanpun.
Semoga kalian sehat dan bahagia, semoga kalian bisa mencapai apapun yang kalian inginkan, dan mari kita sama-sama dalam waktu yang lama. 
Aku sayang kalian.

Liat intro Shining Diamond langsung jatuh cinta sama mereka, apalagi di episode 1 bikin ngakak sama sedih. Ngikutin episode selanjutnya pas dk nangis ikutan nangis. 
Lagu-lagunya pas project ini jadi teman selama menyelesaikan skripsi.
Akhirnya seventeen debut dan aku juga bisa sidang.
Sejak saat itu, sampai sekarang aku selalu menikmati karya-karya seventeen.

Jujur aku baru ngikutin kalian, yang bener bener sampe akhirnya jadi Carat itu tahun 2020 kemarin. Awalnya aku nggak tertarik untuk nge stan grup manapun, but kalian lucu banget, kocak gitu, aku yang awalnya nonton gose cuma buat hiburan pas Corona ini berakhir jadi Carat. Makasih udah nemenin aku, makasih udah bikin aku ketawa, makasih banget udah ada sampe sekarang, langgeng ya. Aku nggak nyesel masuk fandom ini ya walau agak sayang sih baru ngikutin kalian kemarin, sempet mikir kenapa nggak dari dulu aja. But, dari kapanpun itu, i'll promise i'll stay in this Diamond life. Thank you Seventeen, sekali lagi makasih, aku cuma bisa ngomong itu, bcs rasa sayangku ke kalian tuh besar banget nggak bisa diungkapin dengan kata kata, mekipun aku baru, but aku sesayang itu.

Dearest sebongies,

When I saw you guys for the first time - in that Manse Dance Practice Video a few years ago,  I thought you were just some other groups I could stan for a while and then leave, but no. Coincidentally, you were with me in the most stressful times of my life - my last three years in college, when I couldn't get my diploma on time, when i was losing and when i lost my dad and now, you are still with me during - probably - the most anxious chapter in my career.

Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart. You might not know there is a me that exists in the world but I know how much you love your carats and fortunately I am one of them. I haven't felt being loved and this strong of a connection towards an artist for a long time. Thank you. I feel like with you, I am always loved, heard and comforted.

I thank God for leading me to you in the most, darkest times in my life. You are one of the greatest gifts I have ever received. Thank you so much. I hope to be with you for more years to come and I pray that you guys find your own happiness as well. We love you. I love you, so, so, much.

I fell in love with your music and your honest personalities and closeness made me fall even deeper. You deserve all my love and more💖💙",0,2021-05-26T12:36:20Z

@ningmiranti5290,"Terimakasih SEVENTEEN, aku mulai jadi Carat disaat aku bangkit dari keterpurukanku, jujur dulu aku banyak overthingking dalam segala masalah dihidupku sampai-sampai tak hanya mentalku yang jatuh sakit tapi juga fisikku selama seminggu aku gak bisa masuk kuliah gara2 sakit tapi saat aku mendengar lagu don't wanna cry entah kenapa aku malah menangis lama sekali, tapi setelah itu perasaanku jadi agak lega dan akhirnya aku mulai tertarik dengan seventeen sehingga sejak itu  aku melihat semua video kalian baik interview, behind the scene, variety show yang kalian ikuti. Sejak saat itu aku mulai bisa tersenyum bahkan tertawa terbahak-bahak karena tingkah laku kalian. Dan, puji Tuhan aku sembuh dari sakitku dan bisa mengikuti aktivitasku lagi. Maaf panjang lebar tapi intinya 
""AKU SANGAT BERTERIMAKASIH KEPADA SEVENTEEN YANG MEMBERI KAN KU SEDIKIT HARAPAN UNTUK MULAI BISA TERSENYUM DAN BERJALAN MAJU, BERANI MENGHADAPI HIDUP INI""",58,2021-05-26T12:35:49Z

@blueskyyy13,"Annyeong seventeen. From carat indonesia.
Awal aku kenal kalian mungkin sekitar tahun 2018 . Awalnya karena waktu itu aku mmg pengen STAN suatu grup. MV pertama ku very nice , mulai tertarik karena lagu clap. awalnya ngak tau kalo itu lagu CLAP soalnya sering denger gegara dibikin misherad lyric. Lalu yg bikin aku fall in love to sebong adalah lagu left and right dan don't wanna cry. Jujur kirain lagu kalian itu biasa aja . Tapi setelah aku kepoin kalian itu semakin bikin aku senang.dari liriknya banyak hal yg dapat diambil. Bisa didengarkan kapan pun. Terutama ketika aku sedang murung. Awalnya juga ngak yakin jadi carat soalnya disekitar ku jarang ada carat yg bener² carat. Tapi karena Corona , jadi aku lebih banyak punya teman carat walaupun itu online tapi aku ngak kesepian lagi. 
Dulu pas bosan aku bisa stres.semenjak STAN svt aku bisa nonton gose, streaming MV. Bukan cmn ketenangan , bisa bikin ketawa, buat motivasi tapi itu juga biar bantu svt . Wish moga kalian sehat selalu dan makin sukses. Walaupun aku baru kepoin kalian tahun 2020 tapi aku senang!. Ngak tau mau hilang apa lagi. 
Thanks seventeen .thanks  can make things that make me excited. Good luck always.

@vernown2939,"hello seventeen, it's me mia. i am a carat from indonesia since 2018

your songs always healing me, give me warm, comfort, and give me a lot of inspiration, and many things that i can't tell you with words. your songs is that beautiful and powerful at the same time. those emotions i can feel it in many different songs

until this day and forever, being a carat is my biggest and the best decision I've ever made in my life.

because of you, i met with many great and good people. yes they're carats. we are strangers at first but ends up into a family. even though carats are a lot around the world, but we still can feel that we are a family

it's just beautiful

last but not least, let's stay together until the end. let's make many good memories together and giving warmth to each other more. we are gonna be the best family in the world

Apa Kabar Seventeen? Akhir-akhiran ini sudah mau musim panas, jangan keseringan minum es.

Seventeen, kalian sangat penting seperti huruf p dalam kata raspberry, sangat dinantikan seperti sidang saat akhir semester, dan sangat menenangkan seperti lagu Smile Flower.

Ketahuilah, diatas lara masih ada harsa, saat tidak ada kupu-kupu yang membantu bunga untuk penyerbukan masih ada angin, saat tak ada yang bisa jadi sandaran masih ada CARAT yang dapat kamu andalkan.

Terima kasih sudah menemani sampai sekarang, terima kasih karena sudah mengisi masa mudaku. Mari bertemu di atas bianglala tanpa nestapa.

Please know that you have become light in someone's life, especially for me, many Carats, and others who enjoyed your songs, contents, or maybe just by knowing that SEVENTEEN is always there for them.

Tetapi sekarang, aku merasa benar-benar ada dalam hubungan pertemanan yang menyenangkan.

yang kuyakini, satu-satunya yang tak terlihat, hanyalah soal ketidakberadaan fisik untuk aku genggam. selebihnya daripada itu. senyum kalian, perasaan hangat itu, kebersamaan yang sering kali aku impikan, telah berada di sini. dalam sekat-sekat jantungku, membentuk tempat ternyaman untuk aku pulang, dan akan selalu jadi seperti itu. barangkali tak akan kubuat padam, dan gersang, karena ia akan kupupuk sepenuh hati.

selamat untuk jadi 6 tahun, sayang. jika benar segala doa bisa terwujud dalam kesungguhan. harapku akan tetap sama. jadilah utuh, sebagai seventeen dan diri kalian sendiri. yang tak takut tumbuh, dan terus mengukir lembaran kenangan tak terlupakan. yang akan mengabadi di setiap denyut nadi, tak jadi sia-sia, dengan bahagia.

Selamat 6 tahun sebongiee, selalu berharap akan ada tahun tahun berikut nya sampe aku bisa ketemu langsung sama sebong. Terimakasih udah debut dan bertahan untuk impian dan carat jugaa.

@zacchariahwisco9594,"Every anniversary, i'm always so grateful and emotional that I met them but damn, this year hits different coz I'm going 2nd year in college and the hyung line will soon go and serve in the military...

I'm a little bit fearful for the future, had thoughts that what if SVT disbands when they reach the end of their contract?! What if they won't renew it? I've literally aged together with them and i'm really thankful that they helped me go through hard times in highschool.

But ya know, i've come up into a realization. We don't know what the future holds, that's for a fact but what we do know is no matter what happens...

*CARATS WILL ALWAYS HAVE SEVENTEEN AND SEVENTEEN WILL AWALYS HAVE CARATS* !!!! 

so since we all have this time left, we should really cherish each moment, support them and  help them in promoting their songs.

I aged together with Seventeen and i'm 100% sure that i'm going to stan them beyond my youth, hell imma be a carat till im 70!!! That's my story!!!

@gezellight3814,"Aku memang enggak kenal sama sebong dari jaman tembok hijau. 
Aku kenal sebong dari masih pake rok biru, kayaknya waktu itu sekitar tahun 2016, awal"" diracunin K-Pop sama temen. Awalnya dikenalin sama grup lain, cuma akhirnya nemu sebong, dan aku mulai dari nonton mv mansae sama nonton OFD yeosodo.
Lanjut ke masa putih abu, aku mulai sering oleng ke grup lain. Sampe bingung aku tuh sebenernya masuk fandom mana, lol bgt. Tapi, setiap kali ditanya ""kamu suka grup ap? Fandom mana?"" Aku selalu PD bilang, ""aku Carat, fansnya Seventeen"" padahal sebenernya waktu itu aku banyak banget ninggalin update sebong, dan lebih condong ke grup lain, lol. Ngerasa jadi carat KTP, ngerasa berkhianat gitu.
Tapi, biarpun sering oleng ke grup lain, ujung""nya aku bakal bosen, jujur cepet bosen, bukan berarti grup lain ngebosenin ya, cuma... kebanyakan lagu"" grup lain itu enggak sesuai sama selera musik aku. Konten""nya juga, cara ngelawaknya juga, kayak kurang konek, nggak sefrekuensi.
Ujung""nya aku balik lagi ke sebong. Always. Mereka bener"" kayak rumah buat aku.
Sampe lulus masa putih abu aku masih sering oleng, balik, oleng, balik.
Nah, pas 2020, mulai pandemi. Makin bosen lh aku sama dunia K-Pop. 
Tapi sebong selalu dateng lagi, fresh, dan bikin aku senyaman dan sebahagia itu. 
Tahun 2020, aku selalu ikut update sebong, dan bener"" ngerasa di-spoil. Enggak bosen lagi, bener"" SVT saved my 2020. Dan akhirnya aku sadar, bisa""nya aku oleng ke grup lain dan gak setia sama sebong... padahal aku sadar bgt kalo mereka itu my  home, aku seneng sama lagu""nya mvnya, kekeluargaan mereka. 
2020, aku mutusin buat stan sebong only, they're my ultimate. My best. Grup lain cuma lirik bentar doang, respect keberadaannya, udah. My heart will always be with SVT & carat.
And guess what, i feel like being loyal to only SVT is the best desicion ever. 
Rasanya dunia cuma milik kita (carat) sama sebong doang, udah, bahagia bgt.
Makasih banyak buat sebong & carat, udah jadi rumah buat aku. Selalu bikin aku nyaman, dan motivated. You guys, really radiating youthful energy, being with this family make me always feel like i'm forever 17 y.o. 
Aku seneng dan terinspirasi bgt sama S.coups yg makin tua makin cheerful, sama jeonghan yg selalu iseng sama org"" tersayangnya, sama joshua yg selalu gentle, sama jun yg selalu sweet, sama hoshi yg selalu bisa bangkit, sama wonu yg gk berubah"" lol, sama uji yg selalu hardworking, sama the8 yg makin bijak dan estetik, sama mingyu yg selalu think positively, yg sering bilang ke carat buat mencoba apapun yg kita mau, sama dk yg selalu improve and  put his best effort on everything, sama uri boo yg selalu semangat ceria, ramah, sama vernon yg selalu stay cool dan selalu bilang ke kita buat jgn peduli sama standar org lain, dan buat dino yg ngebuktiin kalau selama kita terus berusaha, kita bakalan jadi lebih baik dari sebelumnya.

Ngakak mulu, mood banget pokoknya. Hp gue jadi ada gunanya, gpp walau memori penuh, kuota habis, yg penting ada tujuan dari penuh dan habisnya memori dan kuota gue. 

Sayang bgt sama kalian, bukan jenis sayang ke pacar, keluarga atau sahabat. Beda, ngga bisa dijelasin rasa sayang gue ke kalian tuh kaya gimana. Pokoknya kalian punya tempat sendiri di hati gue. Svt adalah bagian dari hidup yg ngga bakal gue lupain sampai tua nanti. Meski kalian udh ngga aktif, meski suatu saat gue udh ngga bisa ngefangirl, kalian bakal gue inget sebagai salah satu kenangan paling membahagiakan.

Every time I look at you my heart goes Boom Boom. It’s already been 6 years, my tears are falling down but I Don’t wanna cry at this special day. They deserve a Clap from all of us! Thanks for everything that you all do. You encourage carats and say Just do it and be confident. Can you Call us 3 times every day? We just want to hear you say Moshi moshi. You got us saying Oh My! Every comeback with new concepts. Thank you for being carats Home and comfort whenever were lonely and sad. I hope Seventeen gets the Happy ending they deserve, don’t worry no matter what we will support you. Not every masterpiece needs 1b views to prove it, take Seventeen for example every song is a Hit!
We don’t have no Fear! We feel safe with you. Let’s collect the Falling flowers and make a wish. Every time there is a group photo carats always look Left&Right to see if the 13 boys are complete.

Until a PRETTY U LOVE LETTER came and I realized how AJU VERY NICE you were. Then it just came in a BOOM BOOM and I DON’T WANNA CRY but I CHECK-IN every single time I got a notification. I had a CHANGE UP and would CLAP and say THANKS everytime I see you. CALL CALL CALL me crazy but would say Oh My!, and when OUR DAWN IS HOTTER THAN DAY, I would RUN TO YOU back HOME. When things are GETTING CLOSER and reality HITs, I don’t FEAR. Each SNAP SHOOT makes me FEARLESS and all FALLIN FLOWERS remind me that you are GOOD TO ME. So no need to choose between LEFT AND RIGHT anymore because I've now become a CARAT 24H, 247 and MY MY! It all happened just as quick as a HOME;RUN.

@putrialfiana1004,"Gue terharu banyak banget komentar bahasa indonya.. 😭😂

Ikutan cerita ah,
Aku kenal seventeen beneran waktu mereka baru debut shinning diamond. Pas itu jujur aja sih aku masih ngestan sama exo dan bts. Tapi begitu kenal seventeen, aku merasa ada hawa yang berbeda. Dan pas tahu kalau leadernya seumuran sama aku, jadi makin exited buat ganti ngestan seventeen. Bukan berarti aku jadi benci exo dan bts. Hanya saja aku jadi fokus aja ke seventeen. Lagu-lagu seventeen itu bisa ngisi setiap mood aku. Semua reality show mereka juga bener-bener menghibur aku. Padahal aku bukan carat yang dukung mereka misal beli album dll. Ga, aku carat ga modal. Cuma bisa streaming dan ngelike in mereka. Kadang aku merasa berdosa banget kek gue itu harusnya ngasih bukti nyata buat dukung idol lu. But, I know who I am. Aku tahu bisa ku sebatas mana. Dan kenyataan mereka sampai saat ini masih utuh seperti awal mereka muncul adalah hadiah terindah aku selama ngestan mereka 😭❤️ makasih ya seventeen.. kalian beneran jadiin masa muda aku berwarna ❤️ love banget sama kalian 🎉🎉🎉🎉🙏🏻 happy aniv 6th sayangnya carat sedunia !",0,2021-05-26T12:03:27Z

Tp di malam itu tahun 2017 aku iseng ngeliat mv DWC dan terpesona dan akhrnya memutuskan buat give it last try buat suka sm grup baru lagi. And here i am. Still here for seventeen only.

Aku cuman mau bilang terimakasih banyak. Untuk semua yang kalian kasih ke Carat. Gak pernah ada dibayanganku hubungan idol dengan fans sedekat ini. Bahkan aku belum berkesempatan bertemu kalian, tapi aku bisa merasakan kedekatan kalian. 
Kalau liat macan aku ingat Hoshi, kalo liat nasi inget Woozi, kalo liat cherry inget S.Coups, dan masih banyak lagi. Terimakasih sekali lagi untuk selalu memberikan yang terbaik untuk kita para Carats

Mari mengejar mimpi kita bersama sama
Mari terus bersama sampai rambut kita berubah warna menjadi abus
Kami berjanji bahwa kamibjuga akan bekerja keras untuk menjadi carats yg bisa SVT banggakan, sama seperti SVT yang selalu dengan bangganya mengatakan bahwa kalian sangat senang memiliki kami.
Terimakasih kami rasanya tidak cukup untuk membalas cinta dan kerja keras kalian, tapi tetap, aku ingin menyampaikan rasa syukur dan terimakasih kepada kalian yg sudah hadir dalam hidup kami dengan membawa kebahagiaan, tawa, dan kenangan indah. Terimakasih sudah menjadi penyembuh kami dengan semua canda tawa, musik, dan dan kata kata hangat kalian kepada kami.

W tau perjuangan kalian sampe bisa setinggi ini. Karena pd waktu itu jg belom banyak carat di Indonesia. Nama SEVENTEEN sbg idol kpop blm familiar.  Bukan sebagai pacar haluan namun klian seperti teman w. Sejatinya w g pandai bergaul. Di setiap w sedih lagu klian yg w denger. Video kalian yg bikin w ketawa. Bahkan temen w pun g bisa gitu. Terlepas mereka dekat dg w. Sampai hari itu tiba. Bahkan setelah hari itu tiba . W tetep dukung kalian.

Banyak hal yang ingin ku sampaikan pada kalian, tapi karena aku tak pandai merangkai kata-kata, jadi aku akan menyampaikan secukupnya saja. 
1. TERIMA KASIH telah hadir menemani hidupku dan hidup CARATS disana. 
2. TERIMA KASIH telah membuatku merasa menjadi orang yang special, mungkin CARATS lain juga begitu.
3. TERIMA KASIH telah menyadarkanku untuk menjadi seseorang yang lebih dewasa dalam menghadapi permasalahan di dunia ini.
4. TERIMA KASIH telah menyemangati hari-hariku dan CARATS dengan karya-karya yang begitu luar biasa.
5. TERIMA KASIH telah menganggap CARATS sebagai teman, keluarga, atau pendengar. Hal itu sangat bermakna bagi kita.
6. TERIMA KASIH telah menyebarkan positive vibes terutama di era pandemi ini.
7. TERIMA KASIH telah menciptakan sesuatu yang luar biasa dan unik.
8. TERIMA KASIH selalu menampilkan sesuatu yang berbeda di tiap penampilan kalian.
9. TERIMA KASIH telah berjuang dan bertahan sejak awal hingga saat ini.
10. TERIMA KASIH karena selalu bersama-sama.
Aku harap kalian selalu bahagia seperti bahagia CARATS ketika kalian hibur. Aku harap kedepannya kalian akan menemukan seseorang yang mengerti kalian dengan baik. INTINYA KALIAN HARUS BAHAGIA, CARATS JUGA HARUS BAHAGIA YA. 

HAPPY 6TH ANNIVERSARY, SEVENTEEN!

Tapi seneng bisa jalan sama kalian dari mulai dapet 1st win, mulai di recognize di dunia musik Korea, disandingin sama grup2 besar lainnya, mulai go internasional. Pencapaian kalian selama 6 tahun debut itu luar biasa bangeeeeet. I'm so proud of you all.. 

Semakin tinggi kalian terbang, ptasti akan makin kenceng ""tekanan"" yang akan kalian dapet. But please don't worry, carats will always have your back. Jadi terbang yang tinggi, lakuin apa yang mau kalian lakuin. Kita akan support terus, no matter what. 

Yang penting, kalian bahagia, kalian senang ngelakuin semuanya. Karena itu yang Carat mau liat. Kalian bahagia, kalian sehat. 

To a my fellow Carats, please standby them till the end. We need to support each other back. No matter what.

@fatmanuragustin,"Dear seventeen
Makasih udah datang diwaktu yang tepat walau sedikit terlambat. Jujur aku awalnya ga pernah minat sama kpop, cuma ngikutin kdrama. Aku masuk kefandom carat setelah nonton Knowing Brother eps. 252, tau eps itu juga dari akun fanbase nya suju. Dan jujur lagi, aku  ngefans karena kalian ga pernah gagal bikin ketawa (re:lawak:v) sampai akhirnya aku kepoin semua lagu"" kalian. Pertama aku tertarik ke jeonghan, aku search di google agak kaget yang muncul jeonghan jaman longhair sempet ngira seventeen ada member cewek (mian jeonghan). Dan bias aku sekarang mingyu wonwoo mungkin bentar lagi oleng karna liat video uji kibas"" rambut:(( sejauh ini aku liat gada yg toxic fans, jujur senyaman ini difandom carat. Semoga bisa ketemu lagi di anniversary tahun depan yaa.

I still remember when I'm just a 14 year old girl, watching all of your amazing content, watching how each member becoming adult until now I've become an adult myself. I still remember all the laughs and tears I've let out for you guys, you guys are literally one of the reason I grow up well and I really want to thank you guys for it, I really appreciate it. There's so much experiences we've been through together for the past years, the good one and the bad one, but I still enjoyed it because we can get through it together. I know there's only a small percentage of you guys seeing this comment of mine, but I just want to say that I love you guys so much and thank you so much for the past years, I hope there'll be more things to wait in the future, because I'll definitely be there until the last say the name. 세봉아 사랑해!",69,2021-05-26T11:49:49Z

@nvnchi5048,"I became a carat or a “sm17e” back in 2015. I was a freshman in high school then, and I was having a rough time, nearly slipping into depression from just being overwhelmed by schoolwork and my social life. Thankfully these 13 wonderful men came into my life and brought me so much joy and hope. As i got more into the kpop world, i discovered other groups and fell in love with other groups, but i’ve always had a special spot in my heart for seventeen. Back then when I started stanning svt, I didn’t really think much about if they would make it big in the industry or not; I just knew that I really loved their music and their personalities, and that’s what drew me to them. I wish other people can see them as how I see them. Growing up with svt, I’ve watched them go from these boys who had to use earphones as in-ear monitors and recycled clothes for performances to these 13 successful yet humble men who are still gaining more popularity each day. I am now almost a junior in college and I’d just like to say thank you to seventeen for being with me this entire journey, and I promise I will be with them on their journey until the end. I seriously can’t imagine my life without seventeen. My love throughout the years has only grown especially throughout this pandemic.
SEVENTEEN, thank you for everything that you do for us carats (and cubics haha). I know you guys know how influential you are being well known kpop idols, but I seriously cannot describe how much you’ve impacted so many lives and how much of a blessing you all are. From your music, your bright personalities, and just your presence — you all are just truly heaven-sent. Thank you for staying with us all these years. Thank you for working so hard even though you’re tired. Thank you for taking the time out of your busy day to just simply send messages on weverse. I wish everyone in the world can see how amazing you all are. I wish you more success in the future, and I know you all will get what you truly deserve in due time. If I could give you the universe, I would.
We love you so much, SEVENTEEN! We promise we’ll be with you until the last say the name. Happy 6th year anniversary 💖💙💎",17,2021-05-26T11:47:23Z

They are are just so calm and I’m so happy for being part of the carat + seventeen family. 
Then now about seventeen they kinda the best self produced idols I’ve ever seen. They talented, funny and so hard working. Last year was so hectic and everyone agrees that seventeen did a great job by entertaining us through their music and their entertainment show going seventeen.

Secara tidak langsung, ternyata aku juga tumbuh bareng kalian. 

Slip into the diamond life adalah keputusan terbaik yang pernah aku buat. Dan aku gak akan menyesali hal itu.
Selama 9 tahun menjadi kpopstan, baru saat itu aku ngerasa langsung klop dan langsung mantap buat stan sebuah grup. Sebelumnya aku selalu ragu² buat milih fandom.

@rina4089,"Hai Seventeen, Aku salah satu dari jutaan Carat di dunia ini yang jatuh cinta dengan kalian

Tiada hari tanpa rasa terima kasih dan bersyukur telah mengenal kalian. Jujur setelah mengenal kalian dari 6 tahun yang lalu, kalian telah merubah hidupku, kalian membuatku bertahan dari kerasnya dunia ini. Terima kasih Seventeen telah hadir ke dalam hidupku, baru kali ini aku merasakan rasanya cinta dua arah, semua ketulusan yang kalian berikan untukku, semua kerja keras yang kalian lakukan untuk Carat. Aku rasa berucap Terima Kasih saja tidak cukup untuk membalas apa yang sudah kalian berikan. Tapi aku benar-benar berterima kasih atas semuanya (dan aku rasa beberapa Carat pun berfikir demikian).

Seventeen mari kita terus bersama selamanya, bahagia selamanya bersama-sama sampai kalian benar-benar mewujudkan konser diumur 60 tahun kan? Mari kita bertemu pada saat itu

Maaf aku tidak terlalu pandai mengungkapkan perasaanku apalagi merangkai kata kata indah. Tapi dari apa yang aku katakan diatas, aku hanya ingin kalian tahu bahwa aku benar benar bersyukur dan berterima kasih pada kalian (entah sudah berapa kali kata Terima Kasih ini terucap)

I really love you so much Seventeen, We love you so much and let's meet together in the future

Happy 6th Anniversary Seventeen",4,2021-05-26T11:44:08Z

@lena_nguyen17,"Dear Seventeen,
I remembered the very first time I stumbled upon One Fine Day season 1 where Dino was ranking the members. I found it funny to see the chaos. Then I started to get into your music after seeing your performance in the KPOP Music Festival for 2016. Your performance was first. My first reaction was, “Wow how are they so talented?” Then I noticed that even when performing, you all had your fun even though on stage. Then Don’t Wanna Cry era came in and I was obsessed the with MV and the song itself, it’s still my favorite song this day. During this time, from December of 2016 to June of 2018, I felt lonely. In middle school a lot of people were bad influences and usually talked badly about me because of my smartness, even though they used me for it. But it didn’t feel all that lonely, because I had Seventeen there. Seventeen felt like a nice comfort in school. In high school, my first two years were horrible. I kept going through an in and out relationship with someone. In 2019-2020, I was thinking of suicide because I couldn’t handle the pain anymore. The person had hurt me so much I lost it. But your music and voices and the funny content in Going Seventeen really helped me cope. Thank you Seventeen for being a place I can run away to. For being a second home. Thank you for helping me realize I am more than just someone to be used. Thank you for giving me confidence to be me again. Happy 6 Years!",0,2021-05-26T11:42:32Z

Makasih banyak udah bertahan dan berkembang, melambung semakin tinggi, seiring berjalannya waktu gak berasa udah 6 tahun kita bersama. 

Mungkin aku belum bisa jadi carat yang terbaik, tapi fandom inilah rumah aku. Meskipun beberapa kali aku pergi menjauh tapi tetap pulangnya kesini. Cuma 13 manusia hebat nan kuat inilah yang bilang ke aku ""terimakasih telah terlahir di dunia"". Cuma dirumah inilah aku merasa seakan aku manusia yang sangat berharga untuk mereka.

Untuk keluargaku, carats. Semoga kita bisa terus bertahan, bersama sama kita bisa terbang lebih tinggi lagi. Tetaplah jadi carat yang terlalu sibuk mencintai seventeen untuk terlibat dalam konflik apapun. Kita fokus untuk saling menyayangi satu sama lain. 

Terimakasih banyak Seventeen dan semua orang yang terlibat dalam kelahirannya 13 berlian ini.

Mungkin aku masih tergolong baru dan belum terlalu mengenal seventeen dan para carat lainya, aq baru mengenal mereka dari era fear dan hit
AQ cuma mau bilang aq tidak menyesal dan sangat berterima kasih bisa mengenal kalian, disitu aq tahu apa itu usaha, apa itu kerja keras, apa itu kerja sama walau sama orang yang tidak kalian kenal demi membahagiakan idola kita.
Kita mendukung mereka, tapi mereka juga selalu memberikan yang terbaik untuk kita, dikala sedih kita bisa tertawa, dikala senang mereka membuat kita bahagia, dalam kondisi apapun AQ yakin kita pasti bisa merasakannya karna walau jauh, jarang berjumpa bahkan sampai tidak pernah bertemu langsung kita bisa merasakan apa yang mereka rasakan karena ikatan carat itu sangat kuat dengan seventeen.

@원-p2j,"누군가를 무조건적으로 6년이라는 시간 동안 좋아한다는 것은 결코 쉬운 일이 아니지만, 저는 6년이라는 시간 동안 단 한 순간도 세븐틴을 좋아한다는 것에 후회도, 부끄러움도 없었어요. 오히려 늘 자랑스러움과 감동, 깊은 유대감으로 하루하루 행복했답니다😊
지난 6년을 돌아보니 정말 이유 없이 벅찬 마음에 눈물이 나며 울컥하네요. 함께 하며 말로 다 표현하지 못할 만큼 행복했었던 순간, 함께 아파하며 성장했던 순간들 모두 돌이켜 보면 찬란했고 지금의 우리를 만들어주었다고 생각해요.
코로나로 인해 서로 마주본지 너무 오래되어 정말 표현할 수 없을 정도로 보고싶고 보고싶고 또 보고싶지만 자주 소통해주고 관객석이 빈 무대에서도 최선을 다하는 모습들에 지치지 않을 수 있는 것 같아요.
저는 세븐틴에게 원하는 모습이 없어요.
세븐틴이 하고 싶은 음악을 하고, 하고 싶은 퍼포먼스를 보여 주고, 하고 싶은 이야기를 한다면 그 모습이 정말 눈이 부시게 빛나니까요! 
많은 캐럿들이 그 모습들을 많이 사랑하고 있을 거라고 생각해요. 
그러니까 세븐틴은 세븐틴으로써 행복한 음악을 해주세요! 캐럿들은 늘 그 자리에서 응원하겠습니다!
언제 돌아봐도 그 자리에서 노래하던 세븐틴을 보았으니까요. 
말로 표현하지 못할 만큼 사랑하고 응원합니다.
2021년도 건강하게 활동합시다!

@deboradeby2679,"Dear Seventeen 
from one of Carats Indonesia

Aku kenal kalian dari twitter pas tahun 2013 waktu tembok hijau dan kepoin kalian di SEVENTEEN TV haha udh lama bgt kan?  terus aku merasa bahwa aku harus STAN grup ini. Setelah 2 tahun berlalu, 2015 akhirnya kalian debut ""ADORE U""  and immediately i'm adore them. Tapi karena kesibukan aku dan fokus ke terhadap yang lain tahun 2017 aku mulai rest dari kpop dan Seventeen. Setelah tidak terlalu addict dgn kpop dan lanjutkan kehidupanku sampai tahun 2020 saat Covid19 menyerang dan kebosanan menghadang, kalian dengan Going Seventeen  dan konten lainnya berhasil membuat ku semangat dan tertawa lepas tdk sperti sebelumnya,  kalian menarik aku KEMBALI kemana aku berada. 
SEVENTEEN THANK YOU FOR EVERY THING , YOU BRINGS A SMILE, HAPPINESS AND COURAGE FOR ME.

I hope you don't experience exhausting things you can't do anything about, and that no matter what happens, the thought of leaving each other will always be pushed far, far back and away. And I also hope, that if you do experience things you can't do anything about, you may overcome it. As Seventeen, or not as Seventeen, you deserve to be happy together. I hope that when you look at yourself, you see the person you've always wanted to become when you were a kid. And if not, I hope you see a person that you like right now, someone you're happy to be.

@jiedeguzman9591,"Dear 세븐틴,

I honestly couldn't believe I would slip to diamond life.  So here's my story on how I even loved you more. It was November 2020 that time. As I was scrolling through my youtube, I discovered one of the episodes of GOSE and watched it out of curiousity. I find it interesting and fun until I started to watch every episodes, got to know your names, followed your social media accounts and even listened one of your songs. And then in a blink of an eye, I fell in love deeper and deeper. Listening to your songs makes me calm, relaxed, excite, lonely, nostalgic, and happy. All my life, I've never felt so amazed and captivated like that every time I think of you. I am so glad that I entered such a wonderful family-like-fandom and met 13 talented, handsome, humble, charismatic, funny, lovely and amazing boys. Although I'm just a new carat, I will do my best to support and love you.

Thank you for debuting, thank you for making songs and performances that inspired so many people around the world. Thank you so much and Happy 6th Anniversary.
 
Love, CARAT",1,2021-05-26T11:32:23Z

@silvanaf0574,"Mau bilang makasih sama seventeen, sebanyak banyak nya, kalo ditanya sama orang kalo ketemu seventeen mau ngomong apa pasti jawabnya makasih, makasih karena udah jadi suport sistem nya aku selama 3 tahun ini, kenapa tiga tahun aku ga nemenin seventeen dari awal mereka debut baru ikut nemenin seventeen sama carat yang lain pas tahun 2019, tapi baru 3 tahun stan kerasa banget rasa kasih sayang yang seventeen dan carat bagi, dimana hal ini bisa bikin aku nyaman untuk terus dukung seventeen, aku bener bener ngerasain kekeluargaan diantara seventeen dan carat, sampai aku mikir hubungan kita tuh antara idol dan fans atau keluarga. 
Pokoknya stan seventeen tuh rasanya banyak dapet kebahagiaan gitu. 

Untuk seventeen, thank you for being born, terimakasih sudah menjadi seventeen, terimakasih sudah membuat banyak lagu yang memotivasi, yang bisa jadi suport sistem untuk ku, lagu lagu yang bisa menyemangati aku, terimakasih atas pengalaman, pelajaran yang kalian beri, terimakasih atas cinta yang selalu kalian beri untuk kami, carat

@cintialantiraaragani6285,"Hi, ini aku Cintia Lantira. Makasih ya yang udah baca komenan ini, aku seneng banget dan bersyukur juga Allah SWT ngenalin aku SEVENTEEN. Aku sebelumnya ngalamin krisis, aku sempet down karena gak daftar ke SMA impian aku karena terhalang nilai, orang tua aku marah dan kecewa sama aku karena sebelumnya aku sering masuk top 10 seangkatan dan sewaktu nilai UN diumumin aku gak masuk top 10. Aku terpaksa masuk SMK. 

Untungnya setelah sebulan masuk SMK, aku tertarik SEVENTEEN dengan MV Hit yang muncul di beranda YouTube, setelah itu aku penasaran sama mereka. Akhirnya aku memutuskan untuk menjadi penggemar mereka. Banyak banget positif vibes selama aku suka mereka, aku jadi belajar mencintai diri sendiri, belajar tanggung jawab, perlahan pemikiran aku terbuka dan masih banyak lagi kok perubahan yang aku dapat.

Makasih ya SEVENTEEN udah jadi temen di masa remaja aku.

Makasih buat SEVENTEEN jadi penghibur dikala aku sedih dan terpuruk.

Makasih  buat SEVENTEEN bikin aku sembuh perlahan-lahan dari trauma-trauma yang aku alami.

Makasih buat SEVENTEEN jadi penyemangat aku ketika aku down karena ortu aku yang strict.

Makasih buat SEVENTEEN udah bikin aku jadi salah satu alasan untuk percaya diri.

Makasih juga buat CARAT, kalian juga sama halnya seperti SEVENTEEN.
Kalian itu berharga buat aku.

Dear Mingyu, makasih ya udah jadi support system aku. Moodbooster aku, cukup liat wajah kamu aja udah bangkitin semangat aku.

Aku udah suka SEVENTEEN dari Agustus 2019, sekarang Mei 2021.
Harapan aku, aku pengen banget nemenin kalian sampai kalian mencapai tujuan kalian.
Aku pengen tahu, sejauh mana aku masih seneng kalian.
Seandainya aku udah gak lagi ngefans kalian. Aku pengen kenangan kalian akan selalu aku ingat, karena kalian berharga buat aku.


Thanks for ur exictense, i love u so much. 

Dear S.COUPS, Jeonghan, Joshua, Jun, Hoshi, Wonwoo, Woozi, DK, Mingyu, The8, Seungkwan, Vernon, Dino. Kuharap kalian baik baik saja, lakukan yang terbaik bagi kalian, asalkan kalian tau, aku bangga sama kalian. Buat karya yang terbaik ya, kalian harus selalu ingat kalo ada CARAT yang selalu ada disisi kalian.",64,2021-05-26T11:26:21Z

Thank you for being my home and comfort for the last six years, and hopefully in a lifetime to come. You have helped me - and I'm sure many other Carats - through ups and downs. You inspire so many with your talents, artistry, personalities and collectiveness.

I'm so blessed to be part of Seventeen's journey amongst the Carat fandom; you're all super sweet and amazing! :D

@__IdaAyuNitiSanthiDeviSidemen,"tumben bgt carat indo menuhin komentar dan semuanya bikin terharu. aku juga mau cerita sedikit, ini anniv sebong ke 2 buat aku sejak tahun lalu aku memutuskan menjadi carat jalur pandemi, aku mulai kenal sebong bulan april dan sebulannya lagi mereka anniv. disitu aku ngerasa kalo aku ngerasa nyaman sama SEVENTEEN dan juga CARAT. dilihat dari perbedaan anniv tahun lalu sm tahun ini sangat terasa berbeda, tahun lalu kita tertawa ngakak sama kelakuan mereka dan makin banyak inside jokes yg aku tau. tapi sekarang entah kenapa rasanya pengen mewek terus seharian, walaupun hari ini aku juga agak sibuk buat launching bisnis kecil ku, jdi gak bisa ikut hype di twitter tiap menit, tapi mereka lah yg bikin aku semangat di masa2 sulit seperti saat ini. 
maaf karena belum mengenal kalian jauh sebelum kalian masih di tembok hijau, maaf karena belum mengenal kalian di saat kalian berjuang di masa setelah debut hingga bisa seperti sekarang, tapi semoga aku bisa selamanya mengenal kalian dan menjadi rumah untukku hingga hari tua.

estoy muy orgullosa de ustedes por todo lo que han tenido que pasar y sacrificar para llegar a donde estan ahora, han crecido demasiado, su música a tendido muchos cambios pero sin dejar ese estilo que le ponen a su música, estoy feliz de que estan cumpliendo sus sueños y todos sus logros, espero que esten felices y espero que sepan que el impacto de su música a salvado a muchas personas.

terharu banget nonton video iniiii😭
Aku ngerasa kayak gak pantas nonton video sebagus ini
Aku udah ngefans dari jaman Mansae
Dan sekarang mereka udah 6th Anniv. aja ㅠㅠ
Aku ngerasa mereka bukan sekedar Grup fav atau idol fav lagi tp aku ngerasa Seventeen udah ambil tempat tersendiri di hati aku yang di dalamnya juga ada keluarga dan sahabat2 yang aku sayangi (omg lebay bgt tp ini reaaaall)
ngeliat mereka bukan lagi sekedar _""oppa aku padamu""_ atau _""pokoknya dia pacarku, nggak ada yg boleh ganggu gugat""_ tp sekarang lebih kayak mikirin mereka kedepannya gimana, berharap mereka bisa menikmati dan menjalani hidup bukan cuma sebagai Idol/Artist tapi juga sebagai manusia biasa, sebagai anak dari orang tua mereka, sebagai kakak/adik, sebagai seorang sahabat, sebagai suami dari istri mereka masing2, sebagai seorang ayah nantinya (omggg) dan tentunya sebagai diri mereka sendiri.

Kalian hadir sebagai setangkai harapan yang dengan ajaibnya bisa ngebuat aku terbius percaya, bahwa kesuksesan itu selalu hadir bersama orang-orang yang selalu bekerja keras. 
Kalian yang buat aku yakin bahwa cinta selalu berjalan bersama tuannya, melewati segala cuaca mendung duka dan terang suka. 
Kalian yang dengan sederhana menunjukkan definisi dari keluarga dan sahabat adalah mereka yang selalu bersama entah di saat kalian jatuh, dan bergerak bangun untuk melanjutkan langkah. 
Kalian udah menjadikan guyonan ku yang awalnya tidak tercapai menjadi sangat receh. 
Kalian, SEVENTEEN, 13 orang bertalenta, 13 orang yang paling bersinar, 13 orang hebat yang bisa membuktikan bahwa menjadi idol bukan sekedar mencapai tonggak prestasi yang dibikin standar orang banyak, tetapi idol adalah siapa yang bisa menyampaikan pesan dan rasa lewat musik yang kalian buat. 
Makasi, udah berhasil membuat ruang kosong hati dan hariku menjadi penuh dengan kesedihan dan kegembiraan. 
Makasi, udah ngasi warna di hatiku yang sudah lama kosong tak berperasa.

Kebiasaan lama gue buat nyakitin diri sendiri hampir aja keulang lagi kalau gue gak iseng buka youtube lihat mv Seventeen seliweran, akhirnya seharian itu gue puas-puasin nangis sambil nontonin video kalian. Energi gue berasa kaya balik lagi, ajaib banget gak sih? Wkwkwk, akhirnya gue nyoba buat gabung jadi carat dan gue ngerasa dapet support sistem yang bisa mendorong gue buat berjuang dikit lagi. Intinya sih, gue gak tau gue sekarang bakal kaya apa dan gimana kalau dulu gak iseng lihat kalian sih hahaha.

@バレンズエラメアリーグレース,"I've gotten to know Seventeen in 2016. My long time friend have already recommended SVT to me months prior but i didn't really checked them out bc i was already a long time fan of another group. 
One time I was in a bad headspace and was really down and confused about a lot of things (fandom related included). I wanted to  take all the negativity off and told myself I need a change. Then I remember my friend recommending Seventeen. So i listened to their 1st album 17carat and have enjoyed the songs. I remember I was on my commute home then. I have already enjoyed the first few songs from that album, then the last song ""20"" played... and I was just really overwhelmed  with feelings. I can't believe how a song can easily uplift my mood like that and it was my first time listening to it too. Since then, i started searching about them and watching their stuff. It is easier to catch up then bc they only had like one full album and 2 singles but it never mattered to me even if i just kept repeating the same 20+ songs. I love listening to them and I love the feeling of joy and comfort they are giving me thru their songs. Eventually they released more songs and contents and I ended up being a full blown Carat. I started with 2nd gen official membership, I still am a Carat to this day. And seeing them accomplish more things thru their passion and hardwork, it makes me so so proud of them. I hope they can achieve even bigger dreams in the future. And I promise to be a Carat helping in their journey then. 💓 happy anniversary my loves.",0,2021-05-26T11:14:27Z

Banyak bahagia ya boys! Kalian harus tau, di luar sana banyak yang jadiin kalian sumber alasan untuk kuat jalanin hidup, termasuk aku. Tetep bahagia terus yaaa.... <3

Tớ từng nhớ tớ đã mất tận 2 ngày để học hết tên các cậu. Bài đầu tiên tớ nghe là Don't Wanna Cry. Tớ hối hận khi không biết đến các cậu sớm hơn, nhưng tớ không hối hận vì đã stan các cậu đâu vì tớ gặp Seventeen ở thời điểm mà tớ cần nhất.

I just somehow found their video in my cousin's gallery, it was like we were soulmates. It was meant to happen. At first I thought, ""Oof, Kpop? Meh,"" I admit, I was really not into Kpop before. I just did not like them, and I did not even know why. But when I clicked their videos and listened to their songs ""Pretty U"" and ""Adore U"", I immediately liked them. The first member that attracted my attention was Jun. Then, I became even more curious about them. I watched mor of their videos. Even paused in the middle of it just to count the members, making sure if there were really seventeen memb or not HAHAHAHAHA. I started to download their videos and songs, and listen to them 24/7. Even tried singing with them, practicing my Korean skills HAHAHAHAHA. And before I could knew it, I was already into the Diamond Life. I also want to give gratitude to my friend who kept me updated, hyped, and crazy over Seventeen. She really was a big factor in my fangirling life.

@cha-yiwang9408,"Seeing my co-carat shared their story on how they met Seventeen, I had the urge to share mine, too. Hehe
So, it all started when Seventeen's Left and Right Mafia Dance on Dingo's channel played next. I was actually watching NCT Dream's We Go Up Mafia Dance. Without hesitation, I started the video and I remembered laughing all the time. They were hilarious and funny. Apart from it, I can see the sincerity of their friendship and the strong bond they have from the video. I may not know them very well at that point, but, there's this connection that I felt, a tingling feeling in my heart. I mean, I mean it. From then on up until today, their 6th year in the industry, I still shine as their diamond.^^ 

Dear Seventeen,
You have been one of my comfort. Your songs are very sincere that though I play it everytime, I'm still having goosebumps. God bless y'all!",0,2021-05-26T11:07:23Z

Thank you for coming
I hope in the next year I don't hear bad news from you guys stopping ""Saythename! Seventeen!""
thank you for taking my hand that time, when I was really vulnerable and wanted to kill myself. thank you for making me laugh in the middle of my life burden which is very heavy. Thank you for giving me a chance to rest through your Semicolon; album. Thank you for holding me. thank you you guys made me learn to love myself.
Thank you very much, 13 men for working hard for Carat, making the best for Carat, your work is not in vain, our Seventeen is making songs not only for Carat but for all young people who cannot try to love themselves.
keep being Seventeen in the following year, keep being OT 13 which if the members decrease by 1 it will look imperfect (13 + 3 + 1 = Seventeen)

Gatau mungkin mereka boygroup pertama yg gw stan, karna emang se worth it buat di stan. Mereka semua talented dan visual di kriteria masing masing, gokil. Makin bikin insekyur gw cowo gini gini aja HAHAHAHA. Carat juga fandom yang sangat sangat damai, enak jadinya nyaman dan mewek konyol bareng😭. Pokoknya gini gini terus ya kalian.

Dan sekarang udah 2021, katanya 2022 kontrak mereka habis 😭 tapi aku berharap mereka memperpanjang kontrak dan bisa terus sama-sama sama carat. Aku yakin kok carat, mereka pasti perpanjang kontrak😭

@-AndiMaharaniFitriana-A-,"surat terbuka teruntuk carat (fandom terbaikku🥰)  

Carat akhirnya udh 6 tahun kita nemenin seventeen. Sekarang mereka udh  melambung tinggi. Semakin tinggi semakin kencang juga anginnya bukan? Semakin banyak org yg menilai tanpa tau kenyataannya, semakin banyak pula org yg iri kanrena pencapaian kita. Tapii carat harus tetep jadi carat yang apa adanya. Carat yang bakal ada dibarisan paling depan untuk sebong dalam keadaan apa pun. Carat yang bobrok dan tentu carat yang selalu mau dijadikan badut untuk sebong. Tidak ada kata berakhur untuk kita, seventeen dan carat,  karena kita adalah keluarga. Sampai kapan pun akan tetap seperti itu. Keabadian adalah hal yang mustahil tapi ikatan seventeen dan carat itu abadi. There is no the last say the name there’s only see you next time🥰❤️🤡✨

@endearinghannie7178,"The phrase ""Seventeen will find you at your darkest time."" Is true. I was ready to give up everything when I was at 9th grade, then I found out about them. And then suddenly my life had a new meaning, a new purpose. I've been with them for 4 years and also clean for 4 years. I owe everything to Seventeen. I will forever be thankful.",33,2021-05-26T10:56:54Z

I LOVE YOU SEVENTEEN.

Que esse sexto ano de grupo, seja ainda mais Incrível.",1,2021-05-26T10:56:51Z
@shawnvenyzfrancisco4069,"I posted last night that I've only been with you for a short time. Wasn't there in the beginning and althrough out the years. I feel like I don't deserve to feel the love you are showing but I think you came into my life in the most perfect time. When I needed you the most. When I was lost, you found me. And I thank your for that. 1 year, 6 years, 10 years and even in 100 years, I'll be here. Haven't been sure of anything lately, but I'm sure of staying with you. 

In my language you are called

""Aking Tahanan"" because you are 'my home'

 ""Aking pahinga"" because you are 'my rest'

""Ligtas ako sa piling mo"" because ""with you I feel the safest"".

Not one group that I had stan have ever made me feel this happy, content, and even felt treasured by you guys. The love that you showered us carats may be in general but it never once felt like that. Every 'I love you', 'take care', 'we miss you', 'see you', and 'be safe' never felt so fake. Every fiber of my being tremble each time you guys say those words to us. I may not be one of your best supporters out there, but I truly appreciate and love what you guys are doing.

Jujur kalian udah aku anggap sebagai keluargaku sendiri, bahkan lebih. Nggak tau kenapa ya, tiap aku ada masalah, aku mending dengerin lagu kalian, baca pertikaian kalian di weverse, baca nasihat dari kalian dan itu kayak buat aku lebih tenang. Thank you for everything. Aku harap kedepannya kalian lebih baik lagi dan selalu menghibur carat semua.....",16,2021-05-26T10:51:45Z

Carat juga, aku bahagia banget menjadi bagian dari fandom ini, walau mungkin kita belum pernah bertemu langsung tapi kalian bener² kaya keluarga kedua ku❤ carat seventeen semoga ke depannya apapun yg bakal kita lalui, kita bisa sama² terus, bahagia terus, dan saling support satu sama lain🥺 sayang banget sama seventeen carat💙💖💎",114,2021-05-26T10:48:13Z

@latteneunmaliya3289,"Happy 6th birthday seventeen♡
Ga nyangka udah 6 tahun sejak aku ketemu kalian pertamakali di tahun 2015. Dalam 6 thn ini aku menyaksikan kalian tumbuh. Dari kelahiran carat, pengumuman warna fandom, 1st win pertama kalian, 1st rookie award, sampe daesang pertama kalian. Seventeen itu kayak bagian dr masa remajaku wkwk. Kalian udah spt teman  dan keluargaku. Tiap lihat mv lama kalian tuh rasanya 'gila, sekarang udah gede mereka' wkwkwkwk

Tapi ada 1 hal yg bener2 ga berubah dari kalian. Passion dan semangat kalian diatas panggung kalian g pernah luntur dan pasti PASTI tiap cb baru ada aja yg bikin kaget.

Aku bener2 bersyukur udah menjadi carat, semoga kedepannya (10thn, 20thn, 30thn? Wkwk)  kita bisa terus melangkah bersama ya. Kalau kalian lelah, boleh kok istiharat.

Thank you for being my youth, i love you.",0,2021-05-26T10:45:52Z

@diniadwim9155,"Seeing so many carats write their story/thoughts makes me wanna do the same. If I'm being honest, I really don't know what the reason I can become a Carat, like suddenly I slip into diamond life without hesitation. I came to you when you were 4 years old, in 2019. In 2019, so many things happened to me, from the happiest thing to the worst thing (me and my best friends had the fighting at that time, maybe 3 months of fighting? Really). I have anxiety, but I listen to your songs that healed me, made me a better person, friend, and sister. I've been in a fandom before Carat, but in this fandom, it's so comfortable, meet so many carats, talk with them, carats, thank you for always being who you are, I love you, thank you for always supporting our boys, let's always support them until the last say the name. 
And to our boys, sebong, thank you for everything, keep doing what you like, because your happiness is ours too. We love you so much, thank you for coming to Carat's life ♡♡",77,2021-05-26T10:35:03Z

@tiyu6050,"Terimakasih seventeen karena telah lahir dan buat lagu yang bisa bikin aku bangkit dari keterpurukan ku. Dari lagu hug yang memberikan pesan yang menyentuh untuk orang yang sangat bekerja keras, lagu together yang seakan akan kalian bener bener jadi sahabatku, lagu hitorijanai yang bikin aku gk ngerasa sendiri lagi. Meskipun aku belum bisa support kalian semaksimal mungkin, aku tetap akan dukung kalian dan di samping kalian dalam keadaan apapun. Walaupun nantinya ada perpisahan aku tetap mendukung kalian semua untuk menempuh jalan masing2, karena kalianlah yang membuatku yakin kalau keluarga tidak hanya yang sedarah",19,2021-05-26T10:30:19Z

@메이라K,"HAPPY 6TH ANNIVERSARY to this 13 wonderful guys, I became carat in this past few months and they already become a comfort place for me. I was at my lowest when I came across their music, just by hearing their voices suddenly I felt fine as if I  never felt bad all these times, this feeling was so new for me,cause after so long I felt it, for once I was okay for real.  I've found comfort in each smile of them,they are really precious for me, since they gave me back that strength that I thought to have already lost. I was so unmotivated before I found them, but they made me realize, I can do it, it take too long maybe to raise again but after so many tries I success
this 13 guys and carat really mean so much for me, thank you! Your guys presence in enough for me. And always remember, you can do it!

The fact that I managed to go to one of the concerts in 2017 (Diamond Edge) is such an amazing experience and I got to feel how it's like to hear your songs in real life. Your songs are so comforting and I find myself listening to you guys every single day without fail. I'm so happy to say I was a Carat since 2015.

@anarafi54,"Here's the english translation to make you cry more~

My love only amounts to this, 
Hi, my joy, 
Even in my deep despairs, 
You always make me smile by my side, 
It makes me momentarily forget about everything, 
Turn on a song we know and take one step, 
We hold hands and our feet [move] two step, 
Before I know it, 
You make today’s me look forward to tomorrow’s you. 

Baby it’s alright, Oh it’s okay,
Because it’s only you who knows all my lies, 
O ah I’m more thankful, 
When I often see you tired with your head down, 
Me, who doesn’t know what to do,
What can I possibly do? 
I’m sincerely sorry. 

My love only amounts to this, 
But thank you for staying by my side, 
My baby, 
Even if my love only amounts to this,  
I’ll be your spring during any winter,  
My heart can only say these words. 

Like a meteor shower, 
Be a light in the dark sky, 
I can do everything for you, 
I only have a big heart that wants to give you everything,
Me, who has become pathetic ,
I’m a fool who only receives, 
At some point, 
I started hating myself, 
I’m even more apologetic towards you.

Baby it’s alright, Oh it’s okay,
Because it’s only you who knows all my lies, 
O ah I’m more thankful, 
When I often see you tired with your head down,
Me, who doesn’t know what to do, What can I possibly do? 
I’m sincerely sorry.

My love only amounts to this, 
But thank you for staying by my side, 
My baby, 
Even if my love only amounts to this, I’ll be your spring during any winter, 
My heart can only say these words,

Although it’s just this song and lyrics, which contain my feelings that I wrote down with difficulty, 
For you for you for you for you, 
I sing this song for you tonight,
So that I can get closer to your love ...

My love only amounts to this, 
But my heart won’t change,
It’s only for you baby, 
Even if my love only amounts to this,
I’ll be your umbrella when it rains, 
I’ll protect you throughout all your days...",118,2021-05-26T10:25:28Z

SEVENTEEN!! Terimakasih banyak sudah hadir di kehidupanku ^^
Jika saja aku tidak mempedulikan temanku ketika dia mengenalkan ku kepada Seventeen mungkin aku bukan Carat sekarang. Aku itu mulfand, tetapi pas sama Seventeen tuh kayak beda. Serasa memang ditakdirkan untuk mengagumi kalian sedalam ini. Kalian itu kayak punya aura yang menenangkan dan bisa membuat Carat bahagia hanya dengan kedatangan kalian. Sampai sampai aku pernah berpikir, apakah kalian itu benar benar manusia atau bukan? karena hanya eksistensi mu saja sudah membuat orang orang di seluruh dunia senang.

Aku merasa sangat beruntung bisa bertemu kalian, sangat beruntung sampai aku mau berterima kasih di depan kalian secara langsung walaupun aku masih kecil dan belum mempunya uang yang cukup hanya untuk bertemu kalian.

@nadyaray.s799,"One of my friend once said that Seventeen won't last long because they have a lot of members. She said it in 2017, but... Look... It's 2021 now and she's wrong.  Seventeen has never lost a single member and has remained 13 for 6 years since they debuted.

For my Lovely Seventeen,
Thank you, Seventeen, for becoming Seventeen. Thank you, Seventeen, for standing and staying there for us. Thank you, Seventeen, for becoming my strength whenever I want to give up. I said thank you. I love you all.  You are my home, my beloved home.

And, for my Beloved CARAT,
Thank you for all of your support. Thank you for being on my side. Thank you for staying here for our Seventeen. Thank you, I said Thank You. I love you all, CARAT, my lovely and beloved home.


For Seventeen and CARAT from all over the world,
Let's stay together untill the last *Say The Name* ✨


Terima kasih, Seventeen
Terima kasih, CARAT

I am really sorry that I wasn't here since day one but I promise I will be here until the very end :)
You are probably not going to ever read this and I know that but I want you guys to know that you are my one and only inspiration, I learnt a lot of things from you and I must say I love and appreciate my family much more than before because of you.
Hug, smile flower, us again and so many of your songs can always make me feel better even when I am facing very hard times.
In fact seventeen can make me cry, laugh, smile and even scream with even as little as a picture or a short video.
I even started learning Korean just because you got me to like this language :)
From the bottom of my heart I want you to know that I love you and I will support you forever and always, thank you so much for those 6 beautiful years, let's continue this journey together ^~^",21,2021-05-26T10:09:29Z

@fayethalia9258,"Reason why SEVENTEEN will last long;

1. SEVENTEEN is the concept. They're just being themselves to be in any concept. they CHOOSE it. Most reason why alot of group (not just kpop) disband is because they're losing themselves inside the group n become toxic for each other.

2. Self produce. Like, REALLY self producing so much content. They're making a lot of decision within all the members in creative side. Even at the start it's feel burdensome, now that's really a privileged.

3. TALENT. This video just tiny little prove of how talented they are.

4. The Bond. Chemistry with each other members, *chefkiss! we all know practically they're family now. Even in the future, when they're go separate ways to pursue their own dreams, family will always be together💙 

So, here's to many more years to come SEVENTEEN and CARAT!🥂🎉

Don't take me wrong, I said it first, ofcourse I want they become bigger too, but let it be in natural ways. Since I have no doubt about Seventeen's Qualities and Hardwork, so I believe they only will be bigger and bigger in future...",0,2021-05-26T10:06:16Z

The pandemic separated us physically but I truly believe that carats will always have seventeen because of their songs and other contents. Seventeen is talented, not just in terms of singing, dancing and rapping but also in their ability to feel like a warm blanket on a cold winter night. Seventeen always surprise us. They motivate us to do better, to make our own decisions and follow our dreams and to take a break when there is too much. I myself didn't stan them from the beginning but that does not matter. I found them and I promise that I won't leave till the last say the name. Seventeen, you make my dawn and my day. You protect us and we protect you. I am proud of Seventeen and proud to be a carat. Our futures are truly indefinite but whatever is instore for us, you make the journey beautiful. And no matter what happens, we will meet again.",0,2021-05-26T10:06:15Z

@iWOOAHAEyou,"세븐틴 6주년 정말 축하해요🎉
사실 어떤 말을 해야 세븐틴에게 내 마음이 전부 전해질까 고민했어요. 결국 돌아오는 답은 그저 세븐틴이 되어줘서 고맙다는 말 밖엔 할 수 있는 말이 없더라구요. 순영오빠 말대로 정말 새로운 단어를 만들어야하나?ㅋㅋ

세븐틴이 지내온 2193일 중에 내가 함께한 날은 겨우 616일 밖에 되지 않아 미안하고 늦은만큼 더 사랑하고 아낍니다. 우리 앞으로 우리가 함께할 날은 무한하니까 걱정하지말고 웃음꽃만 피웠으면 좋겠어요. 

물론 우리의 시간들 속에 모두 꽃길만 있지는 않겠지만 세븐틴과 함께라면 불구덩이 속을 걸어도, 더 이상 나아갈 곳이 나락 밖에 없다 해도 행복할 것 같아요.
언제 이만큼이나 세븐틴이 소중해졌는지도 잘 모르겠어요.

이젠 정말로 세븐틴이 없으면 안될 것 같아요.
내 생애 중에 이렇게까지 마음을 쏟아부운 것도 처음이고, 누군가 때문에 긴 기다리고, 참아온 것도 모두 세븐틴이 처음이에요. 내 모든 일의 처음이 되어줘서 너무 고마워요.
이제부터는 내가 세븐틴의 처음을 함께했으면 하는 바램입니다.

우지오빠 말처럼 우리의 시간들은 추억이 되어 잔향만이 남겠죠? 하지만 중요하지 않을 수도 있는 그 잔향조차 소중하게 느껴지는 건 전부 세븐틴이 있기 때문이에요.

내가 말을 잘 못해서 이 글도 횡설수설하고 문장조차 잘 맞지 않아요. 그래서 이 점에 내 진심이 가려질까 불안하기도 합니다. 이 모든 단어 하나하나가 진심이에요.

세븐틴, 내 어두운 삶에 환한 빛이 되어줘서 고마워요.
거짓되었던 내 웃음을 진실된 웃음으로 만들어줘서 고마워요.
내가 세븐틴을 알지 못했다면 우린 절대 인연이 될 수 없었을텐데, 내 앞에 나타나줘서 고마워요.
내가 절망 속에 빠져서 잠겨갈 때 날 꺼내줘서 고마워요.
이젠 내가 그 역할을 했으면 좋겠네요 :)

우리 세븐틴! 아프지 말고, 캐럿 생각보다 본인 생각을 더 해주고, 무리하지 말고, 다치지도 말고 늘 웃음만 짓고 살아가기를 빌겠습니다. 다시한번 6주년 정말 축하하고, 
승철, 윤정한, Joshua Jisoo Hong, 文俊輝, 권순영, 전원우, 이지훈, 徐明浩, 김민규, 이석민, 부승관, Hansol Vernon Chew, 이(중)찬이라는 이름으로 내 앞에 나타나 뭐서 고마워요. 세븐틴 캐럿하나가 정말 많이 사랑합니다. 고맙습니다.",1,2021-05-26T10:05:23Z

@caratdeobi2094,"Untuk member SEVENTEEN, terimakasih udah ada dan hadir sebagai SEVENTEEN. 
Menjadi Carat adalah salah satu keputusan yg sama sekalipun ga akan aku sesali dalam hidup. Karena seberuntung itu, rasanya bukan hanya punya kalian sebagai idol ku tapi punya kalian sebagai temen bahkan sahabat yang semangatin dan ngerti perasaan aku lewat lagu kalian, bikin aku ketawa lewat tingkah kalian, dan bikin aku terharu juga lewat surat kalian. 
Kalian berhasil ngealihin pikiran aku dengan baik, pikiran yg seringkali buat aku down bahkan sakit terus terus an. Tapi karena SEVENTEEN perlahan aku semangat lagi, punya tujuan hidup lagi dan mulai belajar mencintai diri sendiri apapun keadaannya. 

Intinya I love u guys, i loveee u so much, ayo bahagia selamanya! 
Selamat anniversary yg ke 6 Semoga bisa ngerayaain lagi sampe ke 7,8,9 atau bahkan 10 tahun lagi. 

Tapi satu hal yg pasti aku akan terus suport kalian^^
Maunya pake bahasa inggris barangkali kalian scroll dan baca tapi skill aku masih pasif hehe",294,2021-05-26T10:03:39Z

@mynameis_kayepop6097,"I got teary eyed watching this. It's like everything they went through just flash before my eyes from their trainee days to the current them. I've been a fan of theirs since they're debut era and I'm really proud to call myself a Carat, I'm not just a fan but a family. The boys have become my family and my source of happiness in a world full of negativity. I'm thankful to have seen them in personal (through concerts) and experienced how true to themselves these boys are. They really make you feel like you're a part of their group, their friendship. No matter when you became a fan, you'll never fail to feel attached to them and wonder what their next step will be. You wish to see more of their growth and how they managed to stay humble and true amidst all diversities and their popularity.

I'm probably rambling now but I'm really just thankful to SEVENTEEN and wish them the best every step of the way. I only pray their friendship will last long.",0,2021-05-26T09:59:07Z

Hello my joy
Even in deep despair
Always make me laugh By my side
Let me forget everything for a moment

Play a song you know and one step
Hold your hands and put your feet in two steps
To me today
I make you wish for tomorrow

Baby It's alright
Oh It's okay

Knowing all my lies
It's just you, O ah, thank you more

Sometimes tired
When I see you crying with my head down
I don't know what to do, what can I do
I'm really sorry

My love is only this
Thanks for staying by my side though, my baby
Even if my love is only this
Any winter, it will be your spring
My heart barely says this

Like a pouring meteor shower
Be a light in the black sky
I can do everything for you
I am to you

I only want to givе anything and everything
I'm getting smallеr, a fool who only accepts
I hate myself
I'm even more sorry for you

Baby It's alright
Oh It's okay

Knowing all my lies
It's just you, O ah, thank you more

Sometimes tired
When I see you crying with my head down
I don't know what to do, what can I do
I'm really sorry

My love is only this
Thanks for staying by my side though, my baby
Even if my love is only this
Any winter, it will be your spring
My heart barely says this

Hardly my heart
Only this song and lyrics
For you for you for you for you

Sing this song for you Tonight
So I can approach your love

My love is only this
But my heart won't change, only for you baby
Even if my love is only this
I'll become your umbrella in the rain
I'll protect you on all your days",1,2021-05-26T09:50:43Z

Thank you for helping me realize that there is light in this darkest times, thank you for being the standard, thank you for showing us how passionate you are, as much as I want to enumerate all the things I'm thankful for but I won't be able to do that but I'll pour my heart out here. Thank you for coming into my life, I'm not late because I know we met when I needed you the most. 2020 was a bitch, my plans got delayed, ruined all my plans and I lost a lot of my loved ones that I wasn't able to cope with I even prayed that if I'm gonna lose another one I can't promise to keep this life and then you came, a light in my life. You made me laugh and cry, that I never imagined someone can make me feel that way through the screens but you did, you made it possible to bring comfort through the screens. When I resigned because it was draining me emotionally and mentally, you were there for me. I tested positive with covid, you stayed by my side with all of your posts, contents and existence, you became my safe place. Your music, existence and everything that you do, inspires me to keep going but also knowing when to stop. I love you. I'm grateful for your lives, so please stay healthy and happy.

@gabinqueens,"This is a reminder of how enormous yet pure SEVENTEEN's love for each other and to us Carats. I don't know when and if it is even possible for us to return even half the love they give us. For idols as passionate and loving as SEVENTEEN, they always say that us, being the person in the receiving end, is enough for them. Just knowing that there is us, who will apreciate their efforts and their craft is enough for them.

데뷔 2주년 때부터 덕질해왔는데 6주년이네요 벌써 데뷔한지 6주년이라는 게 실감이 잘 나지 않는데...

으움..일단 태어나줘서 고맙구..! 세븐틴으로 데뷔해줘서 고맙고, 좋은 무대 보여줘서 고맙고, 좋은 노래 들려줘서 고맙고, 캐럿을 사랑해줘서 고마워요. 늘 좋은 모습만 보여주려고 하지 않아도 되니까 항상 건강했으면 좋겠어요.

남들에게는 그저 평범한 단어이지만, 우리에게는 세상에서 제일 특별하고 소중한 단어

'세븐틴, 그리고 캐럿'

60주년 600주년까지 캐럿들과 함께
더 예쁜 추억만 가득히 남겨요!

@jeandavis327,"I really had to listen to this song twice .....
Once.. for seeing their faces that make me feel relieved, that no matter what they are always there with me.
Twice...while keeping my eyes closed ,so I can feel their voices within me and it makes me feel like everything's gonna be okay.

I REALLY REALLY REALLY CAN'T DESCRIBE WHAT SEVENTEEN MEANS TO ME............

I WILL LOVE YOU ALL TILL MY LAST BREATH ....
SEVENTEEN PLEASE KNOW YOU ARE THE BIGGEST ""HOPE"" FOR MANY OF US....

@lei_16,"I can't really explain why is this song so special to me... I just feel so loved and safe here. Jihoon said in his birthday live that this song wasn't really supposed to exist, so that's why he had a more special attachment to it. I think that's so beautiful. What was not supposed to exist but did, is more special for some reason. 
Their voices are so good and embrace each other, comforting us. I made memories listening to this song, and I couldn't stop crying watching that video.

I'm so proud of them, of how far they've come, of how they improved so much. I realized that I was here since almost 2 years, which amazed me. Time flies so fast, I still remeber the night I listened to their music non-stop, writing in my diary. 

They give us so much love, and I hope we'll give them even more in the future. They work really hard, so let's break records and give them the feedback they deserve. <3

@jaesthminie,"ENG Lyrics:

My love only amounts to this 
Hi, my joy 
Even in my deep despairs 
You always make me smile by my side 
It makes me momentarily forget about everything 
Turn on a song we know and take one step 
We hold hands and our feet [move] two step
Before I know it 
You make today’s me look forward to tomorrow’s you...


Baby it’s alright 
Oh it’s okay 
Because it’s only you who knows all my lies 
O ah 
I’m more thankful When I often see you tired with your head down 
Me, who doesn’t know what to do 
What can I possibly do? 
I’m sincerely sorry 
My love only amounts to this 
But thank you for staying by my side 
My baby...

Even if my love only amounts to this 
I’ll be your spring during any winter 
My heart can only say these words...

Like a meteor shower 
Be a light in the dark sky 
I can do everything for you 
I only have a big heart that wants to give you everything 
Me, who has become pathetic 
I’m a fool who only receives 
At some point, I started hating myself 
I’m even more apologetic towards you...

Baby it’s alright 
Oh it’s okay 
Because it’s only you who knows all my lies 
O ah 
I’m more thankful When I often see you tired with your head down 
Me, who doesn’t know what to do 
What can I possibly do? 
I’m sincerely sorry 
My love only amounts to this 
But thank you for staying by my side 
My baby...

Even if my love only amounts to this 
I’ll be your spring during any winter 
My heart can only say these words...

Although it’s just this song and lyrics, which contain my 
feelings that I wrote down with difficulty 
For you for you for you for you 
I sing this song for you tonight 
So that I can get closer to your love...

My love only amounts to this 
But my heart won’t change 
It’s only for you baby 
Even if my love only amounts to this 
I’ll be your umbrella when it rains 
I’ll protect you throughout all your days...",0,2021-05-26T09:24:33Z

6th Years With Sebongs brings me a lot of experienced and the most thing is  POWER OF LOVE! Every single day I never feel Alone (NOT ALONE). When people ask me what are the luckiest thing I ever have? MY MY one and only answer is being one of your SHINING DIAMONDS( Sebongs). Then, they ask me why? I replied with, Being as a CARAT who stick TOGETHER with SEVENTEEN just a true BONDING which no one will feel the same unless they know who is their HOME to their heart. And that is you, Sebongs. You are my and our HOME, HOME, HOME, HOME! So they ask me what I am thankful for? And the only words that come out from my mouth which ""THANK YOU FOR BEING BORN"" to myself, other fellow Carat-deul, and our precious boys, SEVENTEEN! THANKS for let me be IN this AJU NICE (VERY NICE) family and MANSAE to us for creating 6th Years of memory, which as warmth as CAMPFIRE! I love you guys so much!

Thank you to Seventeen for staying by our side and being our light that guides us through hard times. The hard times that we navigated together were a little less dark because we could hold each other's hands. I hope we can continue to be each other's support and safe place where we can learn on each other when we need to. I hope Carats and Seventeen will take care because even after the last say the name, our memories will not be erased nor their impact lessened and I know these warm feelings will still remain forever.

But I’m a big fan of ""Don’t wanna cry"" song since you guys release.
I always think of seventeen as 17 member group back then haha xD
But my sis blame me for not knowing seventeen as 13 member group. After memorizing 13 member names and 3 group unit by watching Going Seventeen, I introduced you all and guide my sis to become carat too. kekekeke

@angelique_77-e4n,"My first year in kpop wasn't so peaceful. The first two groups I stan, well the fandoms was involved in fanwars. Then on, I was traumatized to stan a famous groups. Yet this past years, Seventeen was introduced to me. I was really overwhelmed by how carats are such a sweetheart. Then Seventeen grow more and more known each comebacks, my anxiety was on the top! I was afraid for another fanwars. But carats remain a sweetheart still. They didn't take Svt's success as their trophy. They remember the artists humble beginning and remain as a humble fandom, as well as Seventeen.

To carats, thank you for giving me another chance to stan a group in peace and to have such a great fandom. 
To Seventeen, thank you for being born.
