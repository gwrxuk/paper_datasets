@CASOY315,So a funny thing just happened to me I was watching this on my computer and then when I was scrolling through the comment there was a International army that commented that she was grinding on the floor when this song came on and I kept scrolling and all these armies were commenting and I was wondering why they were talking about M*sturbating to this song when it’s clearly a sad song and why their was so many army’s and then I realized that the comment section was glitching and the comment belonged to the save me mv by bts that I watched before watching this and I only realized that when I went on my phone and looked at the comment section here and I realized how weird some army’s are lmao 😆 but that’s what happened and if you read this thanks💎💎,0,2021-05-12T21:58:25Z

@snehasar3854,"I was reading a very sad story right now ... This song comforted me... I love Seventeen and will always do... I always wished to have brothers like you all in real life... But I guess even if I can't meet you everyday or talk to you... You always make my day the brightest... I feel the sincere comfort everytime I listen to your music... I love you my brothers... As a single girl child I sometimes feel the need for a big bro... When other people talk about their siblings, l just feel a little jealous... But now that I have you all, not just one but THIRTEEN BIG BROS... I can proudly say that I have 13 brothers and my CARAT FAMILY to always comfort me, make me laugh and sometimes even cry because of their sincere feelings...My 13 Diamond Brothers... I love you~ 
Thank you for helping me in my hard times... Seranghe~
 And for my Carat family...

又来到这个港口 没有原因的拘留
you lao dao zhe ge gang kou mei you yuan yin de ju liu
我的心乘着斑驳的轻舟
wo de xin cheng zhe ban bo de qing zhou
寻找失落的沙洲
xun zhao shi luo de sha zhou

随 时间的海浪漂流
sui shi jian de hai lang piao liu
我用力张开双手
wo yong li zhang kai shuang shou
拥抱那么多起起落落
yong bao na me duo qi qi luo luo
想念的还是你望着我的眼波
xiang nian de hai shi ni wang zhe wo de yan bo

*我不是一定要你回来
wo bu shi yi ding yao ni hui lai
只是当又一個人看海
zhi shi dang you yi ge ren kan hai
回头才发现你不在
hui tou cai fa xian ni bu zai
留下我迂回的徘徊
liu xia wo yu hui de pai huai

我不是一定要你回來
wo bu shi yi ding yao ni hui lai
只是当又把回忆翻开
zhi shi dang you ba hui yi fan kai
除了你之外的空白
chu le ni zhi wai de kong bai
还有谁能来教我爱
hai you shui neng lai jiao wo ai

又回到这个尽头 我也想再往前走
you hui dao zhe ge jin tou wo ye xiang zai wang qian zou
只是愈看见海阔天空
zhi dhi yue kan jian hai kuo tian kong
愈遗憾没有你分享我的感动
yue yi han mei you ni fen xiang wo de gan dong

Repeat *

我不是一定要你回來
wo bu shi yi ding yao ni hui lai
只是当又一个人看海
zhi shi dang you yi ge ren kan hai
疲惫的身影不是我
pi bei de shen ying bu shi wo
不是你想看见的我
bu shi ni xiang kan jian de wo

我不是一定要你回來
wo bu shi yi ding yao ni hui lai
只是当独自走入人海
zhi shi dang du zi zou ru ren hai

I imagine this is what a mermaid sounds like, each word is so beautifully delivered, I feel like I'm being put under a spell. 
And I think if water could sing, it would sound like this. The lyrics flow out of him so smoothly, and like the tide, draws in any who listens. 
It has the weight of water, featherlight but heavy all the same, and is both strong and soft.

@z.z.317,"just realized there was no subtitle. I fand a eng ver lyrics from Internet of this song:

Back to this port again, and I'm staying here without a reason

My heart is adventuring on mottled boat
Searching for the lost sandbar

Drifting with the waves of time
I opened my arms with force
Embracing so many ups and downs
But I still miss the way you look at me


I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I'm staring at the sea all alone again
Then turning back to find that you are no longer there
Leaving me to wander around aimlessly

I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I think back to the old times
There was so much emptiness besides you
Who else can teach me how to love?

Back to this endpoint again
I want to move forward too
But the more I see this world
The more I regret not being able to share with you

I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I'm staring at the sea all alone again
Then turning back to find that you are no longer there
Leaving me to wander around aimlessly

I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I think back to the old times
There was so much emptiness besides you
Who else can teach me how to love?

Other than depending on you
Who else can teach me how to be brave
There was so much emptiness besides you
Who else can teach me how to love

I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I'm staring at the sea all alone again
The tired silhouette is not mine
It's not the person I want you to see

I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I walked into the crowd alone
There was so much emptiness besides you
Who else can teach me how to be brave

There was so much emptiness besides you
Who else can teach me how to love?

God bless the one who translated it",3,2020-12-30T19:06:37Z

And after I saw this video, I realized that this man has talent, he deserves to be treated like the artist he is and I really hope he do more covers and made banging singles like 能不能坐在我身旁？😭❤️ Junnie best boy and always will be 💎❤️",78,2020-12-17T12:45:33Z

@canjunhuisitbymyside,"English Trans 

Back to this port again, and I'm staying here without a reason
My heart is adventuring on mottled boat
Searching for the lost sandbar

Drifting with the waves of time
I opened my arms with force
Embracing so many ups and downs
But I still miss the way you look at me

I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I'm staring at the sea all alone again
Then turning back to find that you are no longer there
Leaving me to wander around aimlessly

I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I think back to the old times
There was so much emptiness besides you
Who else can teach me how to love?

Back to this endpoint again
I want to move forward too
Seeing so much of this world
My only regret would be that you are not there to share the moment with me

I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I'm staring at the sea all alone again
Then turning back to find that you are no longer there
Leaving me to wander around aimlessly

I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I think back to the old times
There was so much emptiness besides you
Who else can teach me how to love?

I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I'm staring at the sea all alone again
The tired silhouette is not mine
It's not the person I want you to see
I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I walked into the crowd alone
Other than depending on you
Who else can teach me courage?
There was so much emptiness besides you
Who else can teach me how to love?",6,2020-09-22T19:49:01Z

@naiaknows,"Jun is such an amazing artist. He's flexible; he can sing, dance, act, and he can also rap, mostly because he lets himself extend and enhance his talent. He is also naturally curious and I think that's what made him an extra interesting person. His personality won't let anyone not fall in love with him. I'm sure he knows he's talented and gifted with his looks, yet he still walks in humility and positivity. There's really nothing not to love about Wen Junhui.

@nissimariepepino3368,"The fact that Jun and The8 have more cover songs than the other members, it just means that they are not hungry for lines. The best thing to do is to support China line's songs and covers. And also I haven't seen any scene that they wanted more lines cause I feel like they are contented as long as they are working together. 

Every member has its own way to shine all they need is someone to support what they're doing. :))

On that show Jun has the largest breakthrough! His concept in that show is different when he is with SVT. I hope in the future they could change their concept, like there will be more solos of the members or units, like what bts is doing. I believe in Jun! His little screen time on their group performance, jun can make it impactful bc of his strong stage presence. 

wow I never thought I could write this long, as a fan, I just really want to see JUN doing what he really wants to do as an artist. also to SVT for world domination!",27,2020-07-23T09:58:33Z

@zunerazoonie4594,"Back to this port again, and I'm staying here without a reason
My heart is adventuring on mottled boat
Searching for the lost sandbar

Drifting with the waves of time
I opened my arms with force
Embracing so many ups and downs
But I still miss the way you look at me

I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I'm staring at the sea all alone again
Then turning back to find that you are no longer there
Leaving me to wander around aimlessly

I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I think back to the old times
There was so much emptiness besides you
Who else can teach me how to love?

Back to this endpoint again
I want to move forward too
Seeing so much of this world
My only regret would be that you are not there to share the moment with me

I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I'm staring at the sea all alone again
Then turning back to find that you are no longer there
Leaving me to wander around aimlessly

I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I think back to the old times
There was so much emptiness besides you
Who else can teach me how to love?

I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I'm staring at the sea all alone again
The tired silhouette is not mine
It's not the person I want you to see
I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I walked into the crowd alone
Other than depending on you
Who else can teach me courage?
There was so much emptiness besides you
Who else can teach me how to love?",169,2020-05-05T20:47:10Z

@reply514,"Back to this port again, and I'm staying here without a reason
My heart is adventuring on mottled boat
Searching for the lost sandbar

Drifting with the waves of time
I opened my arms with force
Embracing so many ups and downs
But I still miss the way you look at me

I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I'm staring at the sea all alone again
Then turning back to find that you are no longer there
Leaving me to wander around aimlessly

I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I think back to the old times
There was so much emptiness besides you
Who else can teach me how to love?

Back to this endpoint again
I want to move forward too
Seeing so much of this world
My only regret would be that you are not there to share the moment with me

I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I'm staring at the sea all alone again
Then turning back to find that you are no longer there
Leaving me to wander around aimlessly

I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I think back to the old times
There was so much emptiness besides you
Who else can teach me how to love?

I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I'm staring at the sea all alone again
The tired silhouette is not mine
It's not the person I want you to see
I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I walked into the crowd alone
Other than depending on you
Who else can teach me courage?
There was so much emptiness besides you
Who else can teach me how to love?",2,2020-05-03T10:10:37Z

@ayuannur9557,"The first one coming to me after I'm hearing Jun singing: OH MY GOD. IS IT A GREAT IMPROVEMENT I HEARD? BUT I NOTICED IT SINCE GOOD TO ME, THEN HIT AND ESPECIALLY FEAR! 
I remember something. Why do when Jun is talking, he sounds in a baritone and husky voice (especially when he's laughing) but when Jun is singing it sounds too tenor or like Japanese idol singer using nose-voice? 
Now Jun proved that he's been improved so much! I want to cry so much (but I'm fasting now). I remember in CHYZ that he has to received injections because his throat has been hurt so much. Jun, please take care of your throat and your healthy. I want to thank Pledis for releasing your cover, but I hope they take care of your body and mental health too. But I know something, you are so strong and have 4D personality. 

I'm watching Going Seventeen for you! Maybe this is weird, but I love your interaction with Boo Seungkwan. Seems he is real to you. I dont know about the reality, but in screens, it seems you're lonely and not many members genuinely liking you. Not all the times but I love the way you've been relax and joking around and can even dissing people. You're being true to yourself, and I'm proud of you. 

In my country, girls tend to pray so hard for the man they love. But I got broken heart so bad haha. Instead, your name is the one that I mention for improvement. After that, you became the grand center for Clap and I'm crying and screaming happily for like centuries. In Mama and KBS Award and GoSe, you played piano too! I was choking and feel so blue-pink feeling saw you playing piano beautifully! Then I watched you participating in Chao Yi Zhan Ji. I remember your friend said, ""Junhui is known as a great dancer in his group, but he challenged himself to perform vocal. Isn't he great?"" And I remember you cried at the concert when saying there's no member-deul and Carats. I cried too. 

 We're at the same age, I'm just 1 month older to you at 23rd May. So the past 5 years, I feel like I'm growing up with you too. From the quiet young handsome boy, to multitalented and real to yourself adult. I love you, My Faraway Friend, Wen Junhui. Thank you for inspiring me so much and giving me so much happiness. 
I want to see and meet you at the concert and fanmeeting. Hopefully the world conspired to do that. 

I know you have home in China, and I wish you can be with your family again. But I'm praying hard you will playing in a Korean drama, or especially in China again! After you're done with Seventeen, because you wont be in Seventeen and I'm painfully aware of that. I'm mentally preparing myself of Seventeen disbandment (and if any other member not renewaI their contract). I hope you will open an instagram acc and I can tell you how much you mean to me. watching your shenanigans and your selfie! I love your selfie and antiques too. 😂 I always thought do you have any girlfriend like the other idol and I'm giggling to myself because if you have, I would be cheering for you and your lover! 

Yes, I want to stay as Carat and as your faraway friend. Hopefully I can learn Mandarin to speak or talk to you! Thank you very much for your hardwork. It wont be forever, but lets stay together for a long time! 💗💞

@fel4883,"Honestly, i really am proud of jun. Ever since he debuted, pledis never really give homie a proper solo or even a published cover. Until he entered that show, he went through so many obstacles and tried out variety of music types with different musicians. I remember him saying that there are many musicians that are better, but no one really can touch people’s heart. Now that he release this cover, it’s really overwhelming for me like the junhui we know now, he learn how to make decisions himself, and he gain confidence abt his voice. Moreover, he knows what to he wants and is willing to pursue his dreams in his career 🥺😭😩🤧",525,2020-05-02T05:59:57Z

또 이 항구에 왔어  아무 이유없이
내 마음은 얼룩덜룩한 쪽배를 타고
잃어버린 모래섬을 찾아


시간의 파도를 따라 흘러가며 
난 힘을 내 두 손을 벌려
그렇게나 많았던 오르내림을 껴안아
아직도 당신이 날 바라보던 눈빛이 그리워



반드시 그대가 돌아오기를 바라는게 아니야
그저 또 혼자서 바다를 보았을때 마다
고개를 돌렸을때서야 당신이 없다는 것을 발견하는건
나에게 에도는 배회만을 남겼지


난 반드시 그대가 돌아오기를 바라는게 아니야
그저 또 다시 추억을 뒤적일때마다
당신이 없는 빈자리
또 누가 나에게 사랑을 가르쳐줄 수 있을까


또 이 끝에 왔어 나도 다시 앞으로 나아가고 싶지만
그저 한없이  넓은 바다와 하늘을 볼수록
감동을 나눌 당신이  없다는게 아쉬워


반드시 그대가 돌아오기를 바라는게 아니야
그저 또 혼자서 바다를 보았을때마다 
고개를 돌렸을때서야 당신이 없다는 것을 발견하는 건
나에게 에도는 배회만을 남겼지


난 반드시 그대가 돌아오기를 바라는게 아니야
그저 또 다시 추억을 뒤적일때마다
당신이 없는 빈 자리
또 누가 나에게 사랑을 가르쳐줄 수있을까


반드시 그대가 돌아오기를 바라는게 아니야
그저 또 혼자서 바다를 보았을때
지친 그림자는 내가 보고싶은 모습도
당신이 보고싶은 내모습도 아니겠지


반드시 그대가 돌아오기를 바라는게 아니야
그저 혼자서 인파 속으로 사라질때
당신에게 기대는 것 외에
또 누가 날 용감하게 만들 수 있을까


당신이 없는 빈자리
또 누가 나에게 사랑을 가르쳐줄 수 있을까

@cherryvt4815,"READ til End.
One thing that I want to say. 

THANK YOU, PLEDIS! 
They're so many in their group. But only got few lines. 
We all knew that Jun is part of the Performance Team. #HOSHI #THE8 #DINO showed their dance  routined and creativity.. And has their dance solo uploaded. But others are wondering, asking this question. If He's the lead dancer of SVT, and part of the performance team. Then why Jun is singing than Dancing??? Well, the fact that I know is that., if you nourished your skill/talent you'll get better on it. This will boost your passion when you keep practicing. And a lot of us knew, that when he was a little kid back then. Music already hits him. It was already there. He loves playing piano, and I think he also plays violin. Although I didn't see him doing that yet. But maybe in the future. Well let me show you a little bit of their background. #HOSHI who got inspired of Shinee when he was young. He started his own piece. tried to create unique DANCE moves, and ended up joining in a Dance competition and they won. 

#DINO - when he was a kid. DANCE is his passion. His father own a dance studio.. so it means, His father is good dancer too. The one who taught him. Until he got inspired more to the King of Pop. #MichaelJackson.  He keeps on practicing while he was a kid. Til he gets better and  better. Well, you cant deny that coz you've all see him Dancing right? And lastly
..

#THE8 (Minghao) we all knew this. That when he was a kid. He fond of B-boying. Hiphop style.. which means DANCE is his passion. Until he wants to learn more, more than just dance breaking. And all of us witnessed that. He improves a lot. 

So you see,  JUN is totally different among the 3. he grew up as a Music lover. Fond of Singing and playing instruments. So I hope this helps you to understand. If ever some of you would like to add. Just comment below. 

And ohh by the way. We also knew that Jun is a good DANCER. Well, training days make him good at it. He's a martial artist and a wushu guy. Its easy to adapt some routine if you kinda flexible. And one more thing, determination. Thats what makes him good into DANCING.",0,2020-05-01T18:42:55Z

@se0hy_ny,오빠 이렇게 이쁜 옷 입고 이쁘목소리로 노래해줘서 고마워요. 타지에서 말도 잘 안 통하고 많이 외롭고 연습생 생활도 힘들었을텐데 포기하지않고 끝까지 버텨준것도 너무 고마워요. 그리고 이렇게 열심히 활동해주는 것도 너무 고마워요. 아프지만 말고 서로만 믿고가요☺️😉,1,2020-05-01T16:18:27Z

@밤하늘-x2y,타지에서 생활한다는게 언어가 달라서 문화가 달라서 겪는 힘듦도 정말 많이 있었겠지만 아직도 정말...정말 많이 어린 24살의 준이가 원래라면 아직까지도 함께 시간을 보냈을 사랑하는 가족들과 일년도 아닌 이년도 아닌 이젠 자그마치 7년이란 시간동안 보지 못해 생겼을 그리움은 그 어떤 말로도 표현하지 못할것 같다.. 처음엔 얼마나 많이 힘들었을까...17살의 그 어린 소년이 하고 싶었던 말이 있어도 하지 못하고 데뷔를 할 수 있을지도 모른체 사랑하는 가족과도 떨어져 홀로 보냈을 7년이란 시간.. 다른 맴버들도 물론 표현하지 못할만큼 많이 힘들었겠지만 그보다 더 힘들었을것 같다.. 그리고 이제는 가족같은 맴버들이 그 자리를 채워주길 그리고 채워주고 있는 것 같아 다행이다,0,2020-05-01T15:35:25Z

@蕭元隆,"俊輝很注重音準跟唱歌的語氣，中低音的時候很棒。不過，當氣拉長或是高音的部分，音準還在，但是整體聲音的圓潤感就破壞掉了，可以很清楚得聽到一句歌詞中，有幾個不同的聲音在變換，很可惜，沒有原唱遊刃有餘的感覺，這部分應該是俊輝最該加強的。


希望俊輝多唱些能挑戰自己的歌曲，持續進步。

@Lumild_xx444,"我不是一定要你回来
ฉันไม่ได้ต้องการให้เธอกลับมา
只是当又一個人看海
ก็แค่เมื่ออยู่คนเดียวและมองไปที่ทะเลนั้นอีกครั้ง
回头才发现你不在
หันกลับมาก็พบว่าไม่มีเธออยู่แล้ว 留下我迂回的徘徊
เหลือเพียงแค่ฉันที่ยังวนอยู่ที่เดิมไม่ไปไหน
我不是一定要你回來
ฉันไม่ได้ต้องการให้เธอกลับมา
只是当又把回忆翻开
เพียงแค่เมื่อเปิดดูความทรงจำนั้นอีกครั้ง 除了你之外的空白
ความว่างเปล่าที่นอกเหนือจากเธอแล้ว 还有谁能来教我爱
 ยังมีใครที่สามารถสอนความรักให้ฉันได้อีกบ้าง

Back to this port again, and I'm staying here without a reason
My heart is adventuring on mottled boat
Searching for the lost sandbar

Drifting with the waves of time
I opened my arms with force
Embracing so many ups and downs
But I still miss the way you look at me

I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I'm staring at the sea all alone again
Then turning back to find that you are no longer there
Leaving me to wander around aimlessly

I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I think back to the old times
There was so much emptiness besides you
Who else can teach me how to love?

Back to this endpoint again
I want to move forward too
Seeing so much of this world
My only regret would be that you are not there to share the moment with me

I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I'm staring at the sea all alone again
Then turning back to find that you are no longer there
Leaving me to wander around aimlessly

I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I think back to the old times
There was so much emptiness besides you
Who else can teach me how to love?

I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I'm staring at the sea all alone again
The tired silhouette is not mine
It's not the person I want you to see
I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I walked into the crowd alone
Other than depending on you
Who else can teach me courage?
There was so much emptiness besides you
Who else can teach me how to love?                          Cr: lyrics.az",0,2020-05-01T14:53:49Z

失落沙洲 (shi luo sha zhou )  Desolated Sandbank 



又来到这个港口

Here at this pier again

没有原因的拘留
Lingering on without a reason

我的心乘着斑驳的轻舟
My heart rode on the mottled boat

寻找失落的沙洲
Seeking for the desolated sandbank

随时间的海浪漂流
As the tides of time washes by

我用力张开双手
I spread my arms

拥抱那么多起起落落
Hugging all the peaks and troughs

想念的 还是你望着我的眼波
What I am missing, is still the way you look at me

我不是一定要你回来
I don’t necessary need you back

只是当又一个人看海
Just that whenever I am watching the ocean alone

回头才发现你不在
Turning my head around only to find that you are not around

留下我迂回的徘徊
What’s left is just me pacing in rounds

我不是一定要你回来
I don’t necessary need you back

只是当又把回忆翻开
It’s just that whenever I revisit my memories

除了你之外的空白
The voids around your absense 

还有谁能来教我爱
Who will teach me what love is

又回到这个尽头 我也想再往前走
Here at this end again, I too wish to walk ahead

只是越看见海阔天空
It’s just that the more I look at the vast sky

越遗憾 没有你分享我的感动
The more I regret that you are not around to share my emotions

我不是一定要你回来
I don’t necessary need you back

只是当又一个人看海
Just that whenever I am watching the ocean alone

回头才发现你不在
Turning my head around only to find that you are not around

留下我迂回的徘徊
What’s left is just me pacing in rounds

我不是一定要你回来
I don’t necessary need you back

只是当又把回忆翻开
It’s just that whenever I revisit my memories

除了你之外的空白
The voids around your absense 

还有谁能来教我爱
Who will teach me what love is

我不是一定要你回来
I don’t necessary need you back

只是当又一个人看海
Just that whenever I am watching the ocean alone

疲惫的身影不是我
I am not the fatigued silhouette you see

不是你想看见的我
I’m not the looking the way you would want to see me

我不是一定要你回来
I don’t necessary need you back

只是当独自走入人海
It’s just that whenever I walk alone into the crowd

除了你之外的依赖
The independence I had lost 

还有谁能教我勇敢
Who will teach me to be courageous",110,2020-05-01T14:42:35Z

Surrounded by members who are talented, louder and confident, it's often easy to overlook Jun because he's so quiet but I hope he knows that there are fans out there who love him and appreciate him and see his talents. Whatever path Jun pursues, I want to support him because he deserves it. I love his dance and his voice the most and I want to see more of it.

He sometimes have to use falsetto when singing because it's too high for his vocal range and it might stress his vocal chords too much.

0:31 Back to this port again, and I'm staying here without a reason
0:36 My heart is adventuring on mottled boat
0:43 Searching for the lost sandbar
0:49 Drifting with the waves of time
0:55 I opened my arms with force
1:00 Embracing so many ups and downs
1:07 But I still miss the way you look at me

1:18 I don't necessarily need you back
1:24 It's only when I'm staring at the sea all alone again
1:30 Then turning back to find that you are no longer there

1:43 I don't necessarily need you back
1:48 It's only when I think back to the old times

2:25 Back to this endpoint again
2:31 I want to move forward too
2:36 But the more I see this world
2:42 The more I regret not being able to share with you

2:54 I don't necessarily need you back
3:01 It's only when I'm staring at the sea all alone again
3:06 Then turning back to find that you are no longer there
3:11 Leaving me to wander around aimlessly
3:19 I don't necessarily need you back
3:24 It's only when I think back to the old times
3:30 There was so much emptiness besides you
3:35 Who else can teach me how to love?

3:58 I don't necessarily need you back
4:04 It's only when I'm staring at the sea all alone again
4:09 The tired silhouette is not mine
4:14 It's not the person I want you to see
4:21 I don't necessarily need you back
4:27 It's only when I walked into the crowd alone

4:39 There was so much emptiness besides you
4:44 Who else can teach me how to be love
4:51 There was so much emptiness besides you
4:56 Who else can teach me how to love?",363,2020-05-01T13:00:32Z

@대가리와장창,노래를 듣는데 가슴 한편이 저릿하다. 남들은 그저 떠나간 여인을 회상하며 부르는 노래로 해석할지 몰라도 내 귀와 눈에는 그리운 가족을 부르며 바다에 자주 갔던 추억을 회상하는 거 같다. 들으면서 퍼포먼스 소속의 준휘를 보컬로 딱히 생각해 본 적은 없는 거 같은데 준휘 특유의 목소리가 노래를 들으면서 듣기 좋다고 생각한 거 같음. 비슷한 가사가 많이 나오는데 '나는 그대가 돌아오길 바라는 게 아니에요'가 많이 나오는데 마음 한편으론 정말 오길 바라지만 그대들이 힘들어할걸 알기에 어쩔 수 없이 괜찮은척 하는 걸지도. 아역배우로도 연예계 생활이 힘든걸 알았을텐데 아무도 그 의지를 못 이겼나보다. 준휘가 케이팝 아이돌 생활하면서 후회된다는 생각 못 하게 캐럿들이 열심히 해줄게. 준휘 정말 멋져. 그리고 너무 예뻐. 캐럿들 눈엔 너무 사랑스러워. 그 소수의 사람들 때문에 준휘가 힘들어하는 거 보기 싫고. 우리가 짜증 내고 싶지 않아. 항상 어디서든 준휘를 마음에 품고 응원하는 사람이 더 훨씬 많아. 그러니 사랑하는 준휘야 우리 오래가자.,241,2020-05-01T12:27:38Z

I come to this harbour again
Staying for no reason
My heart riding along on a patched boat
Searching for the lost shoal

Drifting along with the tides of time
I made an effort to open up my arms
Embracing so many ups and downs
But I still miss how you gaze at me

I do not insist that you have to come back
Just that when I look at the sea alone again
I turn around only to realize you are not there
Leaving me to linger around

I do not insist that you have to come back
Just that when I flip through the memories again
The blank spaces without you
Who else can teach me how to love

I return to this end again
I also wish to continue walking forward
Just that the more I look at the endless sea and sky
The more pity I feel that you are not there to share my emotions

I do not insist that you have to come back
Just that when I look at the sea alone again
I turn around only to realize you are not there
leaving me to linger around

I do not insist that you have to come back
Just that when I flip through the memories again
The blank spaces without you
Who else can teach me how to love

I do not insist that you have to come back
Just that when I look at the sea alone again
The exhausted figure is not me
Is not the me you wish to see

I do not insist that you have to come back
Just that when I walk alone into the sea of people
Other than relying on you
Who else can tell me to be brave

The blank spaces without you
Who else can teach me how to love

@kimchirice4124,"Had to search the translated lyrics so here it goes:

Back to this port again, and I'm staying here without a reason
My heart is adventuring on mottled boat
Searching for the lost sandbar

Drifting with the waves of time
I opened my arms with force
Embracing so many ups and downs
But I still miss the way you look at me

I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I'm staring at the sea all alone again
Then turning back to find that you are no longer there
Leaving me to wander around aimlessly

I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I think back to the old times
There was so much emptiness besides you
Who else can teach me how to love?

Back to this endpoint again
I want to move forward too
Seeing so much of this world
My only regret would be that you are not there to share the moment with me

I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I'm staring at the sea all alone again
Then turning back to find that you are no longer there
Leaving me to wander around aimlessly

I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I think back to the old times
There was so much emptiness besides you
Who else can teach me how to love?

I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I'm staring at the sea all alone again
The tired silhouette is not mine
It's not the person I want you to see
I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I walked into the crowd alone
Other than depending on you
Who else can teach me courage?
There was so much emptiness besides you
Who else can teach me how to love?",131,2020-05-01T10:11:18Z

@esotericmind3250,"Lyrics Translation:
Back to this port again, and I'm staying here without a reason
My heart is adventuring on mottled boat
Searching for the lost sandbar

Drifting with the waves of time
I opened my arms with force
Embracing so many ups and downs
But I still miss the way you look at me

I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I'm staring at the sea all alone again
Then turning back to find that you are no longer there
Leaving me to wander around aimlessly

I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I think back to the old times
There was so much emptiness besides you
Who else can teach me how to love?

Back to this endpoint again
I want to move forward too
Seeing so much of this world
My only regret would be that you are not there to share the moment with me

I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I'm staring at the sea all alone again
Then turning back to find that you are no longer there
Leaving me to wander around aimlessly

I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I think back to the old times
There was so much emptiness besides you
Who else can teach me how to love?

I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I'm staring at the sea all alone again
The tired silhouette is not mine
It's not the person I want you to see
I don't necessarily need you back
It's only when I walked into the crowd alone
Other than depending on you
Who else can teach me courage?
There was so much emptiness besides you
Who else can teach me how to love?

想念的还是你望着我的眼波
