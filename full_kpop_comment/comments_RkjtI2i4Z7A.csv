@rachmasafira1606,"어둠 속에 멈춘
나를 향해 손을 내밀던
그때의 너를 난 항상 기억해
공허했던 하루
길게 내쉰 한숨의 끝에
너의 말들이 떠올라 미소 짓곤 해

이렇게 너는
그렇게 너는

이 밤 곤히 잠든 네게
내 맘을 전할게
못다 한 말을 건네 이제야
오늘도 넌 행복한 꿈일 거야

보태지 않아도
곁에 있는 그것만으로
힘이 됐을 텐데 또 후회가 남아
네 뒷모습을 따라
천천히 난 보폭을 맞추며
같이 걷는 꿈을 꿔

이렇게 우린
그렇게 우린

이 밤 곤히 잠든 네게
내 맘을 전할게
못다 한 말을 건네 이제야
오늘도 넌 행복한 꿈꿔

내 곁에 기대어
그저 편안히
이 노랠 들어줘
위로가 돼 줄게
나의 진심이
네게 닿길 바라

이 밤 깊이 잠든 네게
내 맘을 전할게
고마워 이젠 너의 차례야
돌려줄게 니가 내게 준 그 맘

@Cp-gx6gh,"English Lyrics 

You were holding out your hand
To me, who stopped in the dark
I always remember
Those days.

Can't catch my breath 
After an empty day.
I smile
When I think about your words.

That's who you are.
So that's who you are.

To you, who will fall asleep soundly tonight.
I'll tell you how I feel
I'll tell you something I haven't told you yet.
Today you will also sleep blissfully.

Don't say anything 
just be my side
I had to be strong 
And again i regret it.

I follow you
Slowly, I begin to keep up with you 
And dream of walking together 

That's who we are
So that's who we are 


To you, who will fall asleep soundly tonight 
I'll tell you how I feel
Finally I'll tell you
something I haven't told you yet 
Today you will also sleep blissfully 

Lean on me
Just relax
And Listen to this song
I'll comfort you
I hope
My feelings reach you.

To you, who will fall asleep soundly tonight
I'll tell you how I feel
Thank you. Now it's your turn
I'll give you back the heart you gave me

Forever forever",1,2021-09-01T08:54:08Z

나를 향해 손을 내밀던
그때의 너를
난 항상 기억해

공허했던 하루
길게 내쉰 한숨의 끝에
너의 말들이
떠올라 미소 짓곤 해

이렇게 너는

그렇게 너는

이 밤 곤히 잠든 네게
내 맘을 전할게
못다 한 말을 건네 이제야
오늘도 넌 행복한 꿈일 거야

보태지 않아도
곁에 있는 그것만으로
힘이 됐을 텐데
또 후회가 남아

네 뒷모습을 따라
천천히 난 보폭을 맞추며
같이 걷는 꿈을 꿔

이렇게 우린

그렇게 우린

이 밤 곤히 잠든 네게
내 맘을 전할게
못다 한 말을 건네 이제야
오늘도 넌 행복한 꿈꿔

내 곁에 기대어
그저 편안히

이 노랠 들어줘

위로가 돼 줄게

나의 진심이
네게 닿길 바라

이 밤 깊이 잠든 네게
내 맘을 전할게
고마워 이젠 너의 차례야
돌려줄게 네가 내게 준 그 맘

Who had stopped in the darkness 
I always remember you from back then

At the end of a long sigh 
I remember your words which make me smile 
Like this, you 
Like that, you 
To you who’s fast asleep tonight 
I finally tell you the words I couldn’t before You will have a happy dream today, too 
Even if you didn’t add anything 
Just by staying by my side 
It would have given me strength 
I regret it again ... 

Following your back 
And slowly matching with your footsteps 
I dream of us walking together like this 
Like this, us 
Like that, us 
To you who’s fast asleep tonight 
I will tell you about my feelings 
I finally tell you the words I couldn’t before You will have a happy dream today, too 
Lean on me 
And just comfortably Listen to this song 
I’ll become your comfort 
Hope my honesty 
Reaches to you
 To you who’s deeply asleep tonight 
I will tell you about my feelings 
Thank you, it’s your turn now

2  مستعد أخسر حياتي وان اخسر الدنيا لأجلك المهم أن أراك كل ما احتجت لحنانك  

3   أحبك ❤لان فيك كل ما يثير نفسي ويأخذ من رأسي عقلي ويضاعف ألنبض في قلبي ويرسم الحب على خدي 

4  عندما أريد الكتابة عنك أجد نفسي أكتب كلمة واحدة واكررها  مرارا وتكرارا وهي ❤أحبك❤

5  يا غائبا رغم المسافة بيننا ما اقربك 

6  أبقيني حبيبأ لك وطفلة بين يديك ❤ 

7   لا أعلم ما ألذي تفعله بي سوى أنك تجعلني أجبك كل يوم أكثر رغما عني  

8   أهمس لك انا احبك لأجل تخفيها جوه قلبك كل ما ضاق بك صدرك  ترددها بهمساتي 

9    حلمي ان ارى العالم كله بجنابك ❤ 

10  سأنجب منك قبيلة 
11   عندما أغمض عيني اراك وعندما أفتحها افتقدك 💔❤ 

12   بلا سبب اشتاق اليك 

13  التفكير بك امر اعتدت عليه الاشتياق لك هو وجع القلب الذي لم يذهب أبدا 

14  ليس المهم ان تعيش طويلا ولكن المهم تحب طالما تعيس 

15   لم أحب احدا في الدنيا كما احببتك انت ❤

I always remember you from back then
An empty day
At the end of a long sigh
I remember your words which make me smile

To you who’s fast asleep tonight
I will tell you about my feelings
I finally tell you the words I couldn’t before
You will have a happy dream today, too

Even if you didn’t add anything
Just by staying by my side
It would have given me strength, I regret it again
Following your back
And slowly matching with your footsteps
I dream of us walking together like this

Hope my honesty

@heartsmile112,"This is my favorite song in Self-Portrait. The first time I heard it, I cried. It really spoke to my soul. Suho's voice is so gentle and warm like a soft pillow. Younha's voice is like sunlight in a chilly morning. Their harmony is perfect. I saw an imagery of myself lying on a grassfield as I hear the sound of a stream nearby and the soft movements of grass as I listened. Everything was at peace. And when I read the lyrics, I never thought the song could be more beautiful than it already is. It was a lullaby. This song calms my heart as I prepare myself to have a good sleep. Thank you so much for this beautiful song, Suho. I miss you so much and I can't wait to see you sing again.",3,2020-12-01T13:36:29Z

@enjoylife2485,"I always remember
You reaching out
To me
Who stopped in the dark
 
At the end
Of a day's long sigh of emptiness
Your words come up
And make me smile
 
You like this
You like that
 
I'll tell you how I feel
When I'm asleep tonight
Tell me what you haven't said yet
Now you're going to be a happy dream
 
It would have been just the strength
Of being around you
Without having to endure it
But there's a lot of regret
 
Slowly, I step on it
And just follow your back
I dream of walking with you
 
Like this we are
So we're like that
 
I'm telling you something
I couldn't tell you
How I feel tonight
And now you have a happy dream
 
Lean on me
Just relax
Listen to this song
I'll comfort you
In my heart
I hope it reaches you
 
I'll tell you how I feel
When I'm deep asleep tonight
Thank you. It's your turn now
I'll give you back the heart you gave me

나를 향해 손을 내밀던
그때의 너를
난 항상 기억해

공허했던 하루
길게 내쉰 한숨의 끝에
너의 말들이
떠올라 미소 짓곤 해

이렇게 너는
그렇게 너는

이 밤 곤히 잠든 네게
내 맘을 전할게
못다 한 말을 건네 이제야
오늘도 넌 행복한 꿈일 거야

보태지 않아도
곁에 있는 그것만으로
힘이 됐을 텐데
또 후회가 남아

네 뒷모습을 따라
천천히 난 보폭을 맞추며
같이 걷는 꿈을 꿔

이렇게 우린
그렇게 우린

이 밤 곤히 잠든 네게
내 맘을 전할게
못다 한 말을 건네 이제야
오늘도 넌 행복한 꿈꿔

내 곁에 기대어
그저 편안히
이 노랠 들어줘
위로가 돼 줄게
나의 진심이
네게 닿길 바라

이 밤 깊이 잠든 네게
내 맘을 전할게
고마워 이젠 너의 차례야

And when we have everything to talk about them and be proud of it I don't understand why exo-l's are not taking it serious. Each and every exo member is talented. No one can doubt it because it is a known fact. Honestly saying currently other groups have a strong fandoms than ours. If you check in properly no one can come and compete with Exo's talents. Exo-L seriously needs to open their eyes.😕😕😕. Exo love us alot . And they never forced us by any means. In their hearts they surely do have hopes. And it's us who could help them. As long as they are happy and achieve success we are happy. That's the truth. Seeing them smiling will ease our stress and bad days. If this is how it's going to continue Exo-L should be dissapointed for themselves and not blame or make reasons by pointing the hands to Exo. 😔😔😔",2,2020-08-23T18:15:32Z

@shushuS2,"어둠 속에 멈춘
나를 향해 손을 내밀던
그때의 너를
난 항상 기억해

공허했던 하루
길게 내쉰 한숨의 끝에
너의 말들이
떠올라 미소 짓곤 해

이렇게 너는
그렇게 너는

이 밤 곤히 잠든 네게
내 맘을 전할게
못다 한 말을 건네 이제야
오늘도 넌 행복한 꿈일 거야

보태지 않아도
곁에 있는 그것만으로
힘이 됐을 텐데
또 후회가 남아

네 뒷모습을 따라
천천히 난 보폭을 맞추며
같이 걷는 꿈을 꿔

이렇게 우린
그렇게 우린

이 밤 곤히 잠든 네게
내 맘을 전할게
못다 한 말을 건네 이제야
오늘도 넌 행복한 꿈꿔

내 곁에 기대어
그저 편안히
이 노랠 들어줘
위로가 돼 줄게
나의 진심이
네게 닿길 바라

이 밤 깊이 잠든 네게
내 맘을 전할게
고마워 이젠 너의 차례야
돌려줄게 네가 내게 준 그 맘

@maichennie8797,"ENGLISH LYRICS:

You reached out your hand to me 

Who had stopped in the darkness

 I always remember you from back then 

An empty day

 At the end of a long sigh

 I remember your words which make me smile 

Like this, you 
Like that, you 

To you who’s fast asleep tonight

 I finally tell you the words 
I couldn’t before 

You will have a happy dream today, too 

Even if you didn’t add anything 

Just by staying by my side

 It would have given me strength

 I regret it again 

Following your back 

And slowly matching with your footsteps 

I dream of us walking together like this 

Like this, us 
Like that, us 

To you who’s fast asleep tonight

 I will tell you about my feelings

 I finally tell you the words I couldn’t before 

You will have a happy dream today, too 

Lean on me 
And just comfortably
Listen to this song

 I’ll become your comfort 

Hope my honesty 
Reaches to you 

To you who’s deeply asleep tonight

 I will tell you about my feelings 

Thank you, it’s your turn now 

I’ll return to you the feelings you gave to me 

Forever

@smi17,"가사
어둠 속에 멈춘
나를 향해 손을 내밀던
그때의 너를
난 항상 기억해
공허했던 하루
길게 내쉰 한숨의 끝에
너의 말들이
떠올라 미소 짓곤 해
이렇게 너는
그렇게 너는
이 밤 곤히 잠든 네게
내 맘을 전할게
못다 한 말을 건네 이제야
오늘도 넌 행복한 꿈일 거야
보태지 않아도
곁에 있는 그것만으로
힘이 됐을 텐데
또 후회가 남아
네 뒷모습을 따라
천천히 난 보폭을 맞추며
같이 걷는 꿈을 꿔
이렇게 우린
그렇게 우린
이 밤 곤히 잠든 네게
내 맘을 전할게
못다 한 말을 건네 이제야
오늘도 넌 행복한 꿈꿔
내 곁에 기대어
그저 편안히
이 노랠 들어줘
위로가 돼 줄게
나의 진심이
네게 닿길 바라
이 밤 깊이 잠든 네게
내 맘을 전할게
고마워 이젠 너의 차례야
돌려줄게 네가 내게 준 그 맘
영원히 영원히",28,2020-04-04T13:54:19Z

It put me into the image of a place where is very far away, there is no one there, I see huge fluffy clouds in the sky, and the breeze is strong yet chilling but I don't feel lonely. Instead, I am relaxing because in that place, I heard this song.

This song really can't be described by words. The way the harmonization created by Suho's and Younha's voices is undeniably perfect.",33,2020-04-03T15:52:31Z
