@さわ-t9j,毎日生きるのに精一杯で本当にやりたいこと諦めたくないこと（K-POPアイドルになりたい）あるのにもう高2で親にも言えなくてこのままだとどんどん自分の意志じゃない方向に人生が進んでいっちゃうような気がして一生やりたいこと挑戦できないまま人生終わっちゃう気がして好きなことできない人生に何の意味があるんだって生きる意味ない気がしてこんな人生ならいっそのこと消えてなくなりたいって誰にも言えなかったこの心の深海を大好きなユンジンが意味は違うかもだけど言葉にして表してくれてこんな私でも一生懸命生きてるだけで誰かには輝いて見えてるかもしれない私のファンって言ってくれたあの子のクラゲになれてるのかもしれないって思えてやっぱ人生を諦めるのはまだ早いからもう少し頑張ってみようって涙が出てきた,1,2025-04-22T12:16:11Z

@steveclemis,"I first came across Le Sserafim's ""Crazy"" about 6 weeks ago. I reviewed their catalogue and I'm a big fan. I could tell from the ""Crazy"" MV that she was unlike other k-pop artists as she looked more like a artsy college student walking to a theatre class than a k-pop idol. I wasn't surprised to see that she is from the US and has song writing credits on many of their hits even though that is rare in the k-pop industry. She is a very creative person and I hope that she has a long successful career!",4,2025-03-03T01:08:29Z

#jellyfish #해파리",5,2025-01-10T14:27:07Z
@sairrrin,"From Jellyfish’s album intro on Melon 🪼
“Yunjin drew inspiration for the song from jellyfish, who live their lives swimming through rough seas. In her view, jellyfish are creatures who don’t even have hearts, but live being carried along by the harsh waters. Despite the tough environments, jellyfish simply do its best to survive. Offering an unexpected sense of comfort, a feeling which Yunjin then blended into her song.

…The lyrics, ""Jellyfish, why don't you know / How beautiful you are /
You're busy breathing, I'll appreciate you in your stead"", offer comfort to those who are working hard living out their lives. Just as the jellyfish provided her with comfort, Yunjin hopes this song will bring the same emotion to listeners.”",27,2025-01-10T14:26:46Z

Maybe I am reading too deeply but with all that Le Sserafim has gone through since the past year is also a show of their ability to keep on going. This song is a representation of that.
