@ca_xq4,"1. Saudi Arabia has become a key hub for K-pop: After events like KCON and concerts during Riyadh Season, it's clear that there is a huge and excited fanbase. Korean companies have started to notice this shift.


2. The Gulf fans have high energy: The support, organization, and fan engagement at concerts have become well-known, making performances in Saudi Arabia a unique experience for both the group and the fans.


3. Strategic location: Saudi Arabia has become a central point between Asia and Europe, making it an ideal stop on a global tour.


4. A chance to create a historical moment: Since this would be LE SSERAFIM's first global tour, adding Saudi Arabia to the lineup would mean their first-ever appearance here, and that alone would make the event historic for both the fans and the group.




---

The energy, excitement, and historical significance of having LE SSERAFIM in Saudi Arabia would definitely be an unforgettable experience! Let’s make it happen!",1,2025-04-10T17:06:29Z
