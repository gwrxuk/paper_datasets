@morningrain13,Just discovered this song and video 2 days ago ( years later from release date) and I was so surprised and enjoying the song a lot because indeed I was having headaches for a whole week so this song was perfect. Plus doesn't the end part is perfect for a painkiller commercial or is it just me? What a fun commercial for medicine helping with headache. I really want to see this performed in a concert.,1,2025-02-23T12:43:36Z

@籾井裕美-i8h,2年も前の曲なのにこの楽曲歌手は誰が考えたのか日本人でシンガーソングライターの人がいて大体がソロの人が多いと思うんですが有名な方はその時々のインスピレーションで歌手をまとめて考える そうなんですけどもstray Kids人たちは 歌詞はどうやって考えりのかできることなら 私もう自己流で曲を作り 歌詞を書いて鍵盤のあるものを少し習っていたのでピアノはそんなに完璧に弾けるわけではありませんが思い出しながら感覚や指の感覚も思い出しながら少しは勉強して自己流でどこまで引けるか分かりませんが全くでもないわけでもないのでそういう時期もありました😮なのでやっぱり人数が多いと それぞれ決めれるのでなるほどと思う時もあればまあ日本のボーイズグループ もたくさんいるんですが自分たちでっていう時もあればきっと楽曲提供をする人がいるのかなとも 思ったりするのですがスキズはそこを全て 全部やってのけてしまうところがある意味尊敬できるところなので目指すのはやっぱり なかなかそこまで 低い 低音ボイスの人っていないのですごく変な言い方で申し訳ないんですが歌のアクセントになってその楽曲の幅が広がるのでそこが私の好きなところなのでそう考えるとスキルの楽曲は奥が深いような気がするのでそう思いながらいつも聞いています今は意外とスローな曲が増えてきたりもしてますが派手なパフォーマンス だったり派手な楽曲だったりする方が好きなのでそっちのイメージが強いのででもやっぱり新しいもの好きなので 新曲 とかでもスローな曲だとしてもいい曲だったら絶対 広がってく 曲だと思うのでstray Kidsが作った楽曲だからこそ 興味があるので一度は絶対聞いてみたいなって思う時があります長くなりましたが だいぶ コメント長くなりすぎたのでここで終わりにします なのでありがとうございました失礼致しますありがとうございました😊😊,0,2023-10-04T18:18:59Z

@h-playwithmyhart.4806,"Bang Chan. With your birthday so close I figured it was time to begin spreading the word with this letter. As I’ve frequently noted, I have been a K-Pop fan for almost a decade but I have never seen somebody like you in the musical field before. What you have been and are capable of, is absolutely untouchable and I’ve learned that there is nothing that can take the sincerity and passion out of your character. I will say, despite being a long-time fan of K-Pop, I didn’t become a Stay until 2019. I don’t know how I went so long without knowing or supporting Stray Kids sooner, but I am completely and utterly thrilled to be a Stay now. To this day I wouldn’t know about Stray Kids if it weren’t for the Stay. I heard so much conversation among the fans of Stray Kids about how fearless of a leader you were, and I became curious. Over the course of 2019-2020, I spent my free time, which I had a lot of then, getting to know you and your members. It started with liking a few songs, but then Stay, who talk with so much praise about you and your members, convinced me to see what was lying beneath the meaning of your music. I began to watch Stray Kids content whenever and of whatever I could, and I gradually fell more in love with your performance and personality overall. I have come to know how passionate and dedicated you are and have always been to music and performing. Even before Stray Kids was officially formed and debuted, you had music in your heart and I can see that clearly every time that you go on stage with your members. Not only do you have a naturally beautiful voice evident of vocal capability and strength, but your dancing skills are rigid and flawless beyond words. Your presence on stage is nothing less than inspirational and you ground and center your members in a way that I’ve never seen before. You always bring everyone together and emit unity on and off the stage. Outside of your musical performances, however, I have gotten the pleasure of getting to know you and your personality. I don’t even really know where to start by how touched I am at the positive impact you have already made on this world; even right after your debut. Before I became a Stay, I didn’t know much about what Stray Kids had gone through to get where they are now; and I didn’t know just how much you went through either. However, the loving Stay introduced me to how hard you worked individually to keep your members’ heads above water through the rigorous days of training, performing, and other events that swarmed you. I was, and still am absolutely mesmerized at what you have accomplished to make this group possible, and successful beyond its comprehension. Thanks to the Stay, I know that before Stray Kids even debuted, you formed an unbreakable and unique bond with each of the members as well as one together as a whole. You lift your members up with the emotional and motivational weight of all the words that you’ve ever said to them. To know that there would be no Stray Kids without you makes me love you in a manner that is simply indescribable. I know that I, your members, and the Stay have so much respect and admiration for you because of everything that you’ve done and overcome in just the beginning of your musical journey. I have gotten the honor of seeing at least some of the group’s history and how it came to be, and seeing how you were a huge part of that makes me appreciate having you in my life more than I did before. You have single-handedly helped carry this group to victory and done so much to ensure that you stay together. You have always kept your promise that you, in words that I once heard you say, “Don’t leave anybody behind.” On top of leading your group to all of its success and glory, your are also humble and kind and always put them first. You sacrifice so much for your music, your members, and Stay and we recognize how hard you work day in and day out. You are so funny, clever, and know not to take life too seriously. At the same time you are professional, intelligent, respectful, and wise beyond your years. You are every bit qualified to be the leader that you are and I hope you never doubt your capability of doing that because Stay have seen you build something beautiful with your own two hands from the ground up. You never gave up even when the world encouraged you to and from that I find so much inspiration that I don’t even know how how to thank you. All I do know is that your family and parents are the most proud of you and love you more than any of us do. I can’t even imagine how strong they think you are for what you’ve created. I don’t want to put any more pressure or a burden on you, but so much would crash and burn without you and I hope that our love and support is enough to lift you up through your darkest times. You deserve so many blessings and praise. I just hope that you know your efforts are being recognized every second and that Stay, your members, and your family love you beyond words. I can’t thank you enough for everything that you’ve already done. You make Stay and your members feel so valued and desired and I know that only you can do that. I can’t wait to see what you do next because I know that I couldn’t leave you or stop supporting you if I tried. On behalf of your friends, Stay, members, and most importantly family, I pray that this birthday is filled with all of those blessings that you deserve and that it’s everything that you desire. I pray that you and your loved ones remain in good good health and good faith, because the world is relying on it in order to fully heal and love each other. Happy early birthday Bang Chan, and from the bottom of my heart, we absolutely adore you. You make Stray Kids all around the world stay.",18,2023-09-27T06:41:19Z

la musique side effects parle d'un médicaments que les garçons utilise comme dr0gue pour en arriver au su!c!de sauf que ce médicaments leurs font avoir des effets secondaire comme (la nerveusité, l'insomnie,la nausée,l'gitation et l'anxiété) c'est pour qu'ils disent qu'ils ont mal a la tête c'est juste a cause du médicament .dans l'intro seungmin dis qu'il avait confiance en lui pourtant il c'est plongé dans la dr0gue en se demandent pourquoi il s'est emporté  0:16 chan se demande lui pourquoi cela est-il si douloureux leeknow lui es perdu il veut en finir qu'il est encore entre la vie et la m0rt à 01:15 (pourquoi ma vision est trouble , pourquoi cela ne se termine pas) tout les autres aussi on sombrer dans la dr0gue mais Chan même si lui aussi à la base était plonger dans cette dr0gue il a essayer de résonner tout les autres membres en disant 4 fois non 2:14(non non non non) mais malheureusement il n'a absolument pas réussi à les sauver donc ils finissent par tous m0urrir à la fin...

(voilà dites-moi si j'ai fais des erreurs et dsl pour les fautes d'orthographe)

mais maintenant side effects est devenu ma musique préféré juste parce j'ai enfin compris le sens de la musique et c'est un sujet qui me touche réellement donc voilà

@killingtimekillingmoon7523,"It saddens me how beautiful, how raw and how rejected this song is. Side Effects could have been so much more popular if kpop encouraged more such creativity, to let the artists expose how human and relatable they are. Not everything needs to be cheerful, colorful or crafted for tiktok. I understand the financial issues, it is an huge industry, after all. But we're also talking about music, about art, which is often forgotten in music industry these days.
Side Effects, I love you. Thank you, Stray Kids. You're living proof of how it's possible to reach massive numbers without losing your soul in the process. Thank you, Stay. We did it.",0,2023-05-31T10:13:10Z

Они здорово опередили индустрию в тот момент.

Сейчас, спустя 3 года, эти клип и песни все еще свежие, хореография сложная и на высоком уровне. Выглядит как песня/клип/хореография с 2022 года.

@h-playwithmyhart.4806,"Bang Chan. As I’ve frequently noted, I have been a K-Pop fan for almost a decade but I have never seen somebody like you in the musical field before. What you have been and are capable of, is absolutely untouchable and I’ve learned that there is nothing that can take the sincerity and passion out of your character. I will say, despite being a long-time fan of K-Pop, I didn’t become a Stay until the just a few years ago. I don’t know how I went so long without knowing or supporting Stray Kids sooner, but I am completely and utterly thrilled to be a Stay now. To this day I wouldn’t know about Stray Kids if it weren’t for the Stay. I heard so much conversation among the fans of Stray Kids about how fearless of a leader you were, and I became curious. Over the course of those few years, I have spent my free time, which I lately have a lot of, getting to know you and your members. It started with liking a few songs, but then Stay, who talk with so much praise about you and your members, convinced me to see what was lying beneath the meaning of your music. I began to watch Stray Kids content whenever and of whatever I could, and I gradually fell more in love with your performance and personality overall. I have come to know how passionate and dedicated you are and have always been to music and performing. Even before Stray Kids was officially formed and debuted, you had music in your heart and I can see that clearly every time that you go on stage with your members. Not only do you have a naturally beautiful voice evident of vocal capability and strength, but your dancing skills are rigid and flawless beyond words. Your presence on stage is nothing less than inspirational and you ground and center your members in a way that I’ve never seen before. You always bring everyone together and emit unity on and off the stage. Outside of your musical performances, however, I have gotten the pleasure of getting to know you and your personality. I don’t even really know where to start by how touched I am at the positive impact you have already made on this world despite still having so much more left to say. Before I became a Stay, I didn’t know much about what Stray Kids had gone through to get where they are now; and I didn’t know just how much you went through either. However, the loving Stay introduced me to how hard you worked individually to keep your members’ heads above water through the rigorous days of training, performing, and other events that swarmed you. I was, and still am absolutely mesmerized at what you have accomplished to make this group possible, and successful beyond its comprehension. Thanks to the Stay, I know that before Stray Kids even debuted, you formed an unbreakable and unique bond with each of the members as well as one together as a whole. You lift your members up with the emotional and motivational weight of all the words that you’ve ever said to them. To know that there would be no Stray Kids without you makes me love you in a manner that is simply indescribable. I know that I, your members, and the Stay have so much respect and admiration for you because of everything that you’ve done and overcome in just the beginning of your musical journey. I have gotten the honor of seeing at least some of the group’s history and how it came to be, and seeing how you were a huge part of that makes me appreciate having you in my life more than I did before. You have single-handedly helped carry this group to victory and done so much to ensure that you stay together. You have always kept your promise that you, in words that I once heard you say, “Don’t leave anybody behind.” On top of leading your group to all of its success and glory, your are also humble and kind and always put them first. You sacrifice so much for your music, your members, and Stay and we recognize how hard you work day in and day out. You are so funny, clever, and know not to take life too seriously. At the same time you are professional, intelligent, respectful, and wise beyond your years. You are every bit qualified to be the leader that you are and I hope you never doubt your capability of doing that because Stay have seen you build something beautiful with your own two hands from the ground up. You never gave up even when the world encouraged you to and from that I find so much inspiration that I don’t even know how how to thank you. All I do know is that your family and parents are the most proud of you and love you more than any of us do. I can’t even imagine how strong they think you are for what you’ve created. I don’t want to put any more pressure or a burden on you, but so much would crash and burn without you and I hope that our love and support is enough to lift you up through your darkest times. You deserve so many blessings and praise. I just hope that you know your efforts are being recognized every second and that Stay, your members, and your family love you beyond words. I can’t thank you enough for everything that you’ve already done. You make Stay and your members feel so valued and desired and I know that only you can do that. I can’t wait to see what you do next because I know that I couldn’t leave you or stop supporting you if I tried. On behalf of your friends, Stay, members, and most importantly family, I pray that this birthday is filled with all of those blessings that you deserve and that it’s everything that you desire. I pray that you and your loved ones remain in good good health and good faith, because the world is relying on it in order to fully heal and love each other. Happy birthday Bang Chan, and from the bottom of my heart, we absolutely adore you. You make Stray Kids all around the world stay!",0,2022-09-30T05:43:12Z

@h-playwithmyhart.4806,"Felix. You have to be one of the biggest blessings on this Earth. I know that I crossed paths with Stray Kids for a reason, and I know you were one of those reasons. Before I even knew anything about Stray Kids, I knew about you. Three years ago, when I got my introduction to K-Pop and was beginning to like quite a few groups, I didn’t know much about Stray Kids, but I did know about you. I couldn’t go anywhere without hearing anybody talk about you, and that was what lead me into wanting to find out more about you, and your position in Stray Kids. I came into the fandom blindly, without knowing any of the names of the members, and relied on the Stay to tell me everything I needed to know about you. It was because of the intense loving fanbase that you have that I learned, in only a matter of days, what a rare talent you are. The depth of your voice combined with your passionate vocals is one of the most beautiful sounds I have ever heard. Your rapping and singing abilities are entirely specific to you and are so captivatingly intriguing, that I knew I loved you from the moment I first got introduced to you. You are so flexible with your voice and on the stage; and once I first got notice of how outstanding you are, I couldn’t stop discovering what made you so enticing and lovable. You are so recognized and appreciated for your natural talent that word reached me about how special you are before I even got a chance to know who Stray Kids really were. Since then, I have been a Stay, and I can say that you are an individual that led me to become one. I have never seen someone with such a bright presence and spirit completely dominant on stage and create an environment so mysterious and energetic for so many people. You bring to music what nobody else can, and I am so happy you share that with all of your Stay when you could be doing something else. I see how happy that you make your members, and since I am a relatively new fan, I still have yet to learn everything that Stray Kids has been through in the years that you’ve been active. However, I have already seen how much you have healed your members when they needed you the most and provided for Stay a support system that they can actually believe in. You are such a delight to be around and I get so happy just seeing your face these days, especially with all of the craziness that’s in the world. You have a strong-willed heart, and you are extremely kind, forgiving, and non-judgmental. I have loved becoming so acquainted with you and appreciating all of your hard work because you deserve it! You do so much for everyone, and I hope you know that you are so loved and Stay are so grateful to you for even the little things that you do every single day! Never give up and I hope you continue to be the person that uplifts Stay and your members! I know that no matter what happens, Stay will always support you and I can’t tell you how much you really mean to all of us. Thank you so much for being such a kind and loving human being, and for accepting me and so many people into your family as Stay! I pray that you and your loved ones stay safe, and find happiness and worth in the future. On behalf of your friends, members, Stay, and most importantly, your family, I want to wish you the most entertaining and enjoyable birthday ever! Felix, have fun, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, stay safe, Happy, Birthday, and WE LOVE YOU!!!!",1,2022-09-14T00:48:43Z
@h-playwithmyhart.4806,"Jisung. Deciding to support Stray Kids has been one of the best decisions of my entire life, and you are one of the people who are the reason why I do so. I only just started supporting K-Pop groups three years ago, and I discovered so many groups because I had the time on my hands. However, since I graduated high school I have found I have been a lot busier and unfortunately haven’t been able to dedicate my time to supporting these groups that I like. I didn’t think that there was going to be any time left for me to support another group, but then you came along. My first experience from Stray Kids was the song ‘Side Effects,’ and it fortunately was a song where I got to hear the vocal and rap blend of your versatile voice. Next, it was ‘Boxer,’ which despite it being an upbeat song, almost moved to to tears because of how beautiful your voice sounded.  After that, I watched you on ‘The Masked Singer,’ and I couldn’t stop from there. I quickly learned that there is nothing that you can’t do. You are a stunning vocalist, flexible rapper, and outstanding dancer. Overall, this allows for you to be one of the most exceptional performers that I, and other Stay, have ever come to know. I knew, right from the moment that I heard your voice, that I had to have more. I kept going, and since then, I have come to learn so much about you and the legacy that you have already left on music. Stay is one of the most unique fandoms that I have been so fortunate to join, and I now know that you are one of the reasons why. I had always thought about Stray Kids as being such an active group and constantly releasing music and content to show how much Stay meant to them, only to find out that you have been such a huge part of that all along. I haven’t even been a Stay for very long yet, but I already have seen the indescribable impact that you left on Stay. It is unlike anything that I have ever seen. I can see how happy, inspired, and desperate that Stay are to reciprocate every ounce of love that you give to them. When I became aware of this, I knew I had to be a part of it. You are so generous, honest, loyal, and possibly most importantly, I have seen you completely change the type of day someone is having just by setting the mood. Whether it be your members, or Stay, you always make sure that everyone is having the best day possible, even it means you have to sacrifice your mood for somebody else. Because you are just naturally funny and inclined to make everybody around you happy, you have an outlook on life that causes everybody you ever meet to be better and happier because of it all. As I’ve said, I haven’t been a Stay for long at all, but on behalf of the other fans, I already can’t even thank you enough for everything that you do every day. You have such a refreshing personality that we all need, especially at this time in the world. I hope that you never lose the innate kindness in your heart and actions; and I am so blessed to be able to thank you for all of it today. On behalf of Stay, who encouraged me to join them and showed me that there are no limits to your love, your members, who adore you quite possibly in a way that no other person can, and your friends and family, who we know are so proud of you, I want to wish you the happiest birthday ever Jisung! I pray that you and your l loved ones stay safe and find happiness and worth in the future. I am so proud of everything that you have accomplished and am so glad I get to see you grow each day now! PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE stay safe, and I hope you know how much we all absolutely love you so much!!! Be happy!!",0,2022-09-12T21:59:41Z

@h-playwithmyhart.4806,"Seungmin, I would like to wish you an early happy birthday, as the time is drawing close. My introduction to Stray Kids was unique in that the reason I decided to support it was because of the fans. I have been a K-Pop fan for almost a decade, and I have come to support many groups. However, becoming a Stay was a new experience for me because it was the first time that I joined a group because the love from the fans was so strong, I knew I needed to be a part of it. I learned about each Stray Kids member one at a time, and what I learned and admired very quickly about you was your individuality. Every member stands out for their own reasons, but your charm is retaining your individuality and independence while still being a part of something bigger. I became an official Stay two years ago, and since then I have gotten to see how well you blend in with your members. You are such a valued member of Stray Kids, that we can’t see them existing without you. You’ve also created a journey of personal growth and development both musically and personally and I have felt so connected to you since I’ve become a Stay. Your personality is so enticing in that sometimes you can be quiet and shy, but other times you are very vocal and humorous with your members. It’s very powerful that you can be so sweet and naturally kind-hearted without saying any words sometimes, while other times, being open and direct about how you feel. I can see how much your loving personality has impacted your members, because I’ve never seen them happier than when you spend time with them. You are always making your members laugh and motivating them just by putting one smile on their face. I feel so inspired watching you build such a trustworthy relationship with them and want to be at least half as generous as you. I know that your members are so thankful for you everyday and couldn’t be anywhere near as successful without you. I have never heard a fanbase talk so highly and frequently of a member in the way that they honor you. I always hear Stay talking about how gentle and sweet you are; and how much positivity and love you bring to the world wherever you go. Stay talk about your rare, emotion-based, and versatile voice that captivates everyone into your performance. They talk about the flawless and effortless dancing that you work so hard to share with us and spoil us with on every stage. They talk about your overall professional and inspirational performance on stage that leaves every Stay wanting to spend more time with you. I’ve heard so much about how beloved you are Seungmin, and once I became a Stay, I am seeing for myself how much you are adored all over the world. Not only by Stay, but the loving influence that you have on your members makes them and everyone that you meet a kinder and more loving person. Stay praise and speak so highly of you, that I can’t say I’ve experienced a family this loving toward an idol. I just want you know how much love there is everywhere all around the world for you. You are the reason that so many people lift their heads up and keep going another day, including me. There is so much negativity going on in the world right now, and to have you as a role model and see it not preventing you from sharing more love is making the world even stronger and closer to restoring to its greatness. I really feel like we don’t deserve you sometimes because your genuine strong heart is hard to come across these days. I hope that we can repay you even a little bit of the love you’ve shown us in just a few years since your debut. I know you have worked so hard to be where you are and I don’t even want to pretend to know how much you’ve probably gone through. I just want to take this day, and every day afterwards to recognize and let you become aware of how much I, Stay, and your members really love you. I know that your parents and the rest of your family are prouder of you than any other person and they respond to every action you take with great respect, understanding, and love. Your members and family are so lucky to have you and I know that are thankful and appreciative of you every day. Thank you so much for sacrificing more than we know just to make us happy even a little bit. On behalf of your friends, members, Stay, and loving family, I hope that the love that you have given to this world is given back to you on this special day and every day in your future. Please surround yourself by the people that love you most, and let the love that we have for you give you the most fulfillment! I wish you nothing but happiness for you and your loved ones, and I pray that you all stay safe. Happy birthday Seungmin! We adore you so much and we are so grateful to have such a bright light in our lives!",1,2022-09-04T22:47:37Z

@h-playwithmyhart.4806,"Changbin. It only took a few months for me to fall completely in love with Stray Kids and you, even when I barely knew anything about the group. What caught my attention right away was your rapping skills. I've never heard anybody rap like you, and I know I won't for the rest of my life. There's something about the way you do it, and I guess some people really are born with talents. I am so glad you are sharing your musical ability with the world because you were meant to do it. The charisma, passion, and ease into which you weave into your rap enticed me from the moment I first heard a Stray Kids song and it was history from there. It was impossible to not become a STAY, and it's one of the best decisions I've made in my life. I hope that you keep rapping and singing and that you flourish and grown in Stray Kids, as well as individually, as long as you live. I am so grateful I stumbled upon your once-in-a-lifetime voice, and am so blessed to get to hear it whenever I want. Please do not stop making music because I, and every other STAY, need your voice to keep going another day. I am so proud of everything you've accomplished in just two years in SKZ and can't wait to see what you do next. I will always support you and look forward to hearing what else you can do with your versatile voice and outstanding performance etiquette. Keep dancing perfectly, singing beautifully (as you demonstrate in this video), and most of all, rapping, which is what you do best unlike no other. You are an absolutely beautiful rapper, and I hope you never give that up for anyone or anything. I absolutely adore you, and thank you for working so hard every day. Don't give up. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE stay safe, and enjoy your birthday! Here's to many more and all of the success that will meet you in the future. I love you!!!! 😘🥰👑❤️🎈🎊🎂🎉🎁",2,2022-08-09T18:09:18Z

@h-playwithmyhart.4806,"Hyunjin. It was certainly your musicality that drew me to you first. You have such a playful but easy tone which highlights and gives definition to every Stray Kids song. You don’t have fixated or set rapping style. You are very experimental vocally and lyrically and I’ve found myself charmed by your voice due the versatility of it. I also love your singing style for similar reasons. You are just as diverse of a singer as you are rapper. It is really peaceful and harmonious; and blends perfectly with the rest of your members. I love how you don’t hold anything back when you’re singing and I can really feel the emotion and work that you pour into each line that you sing. Similarly to your singing and rapping, your body knows no limits when you are met with a choreography. You dance with a ferocity and a passion that no other performers can possess. You take each choreography and sincerely make it your own, which is honestly a blessing to watch. When you are dancing, you can be yourself and express your emotions with the beauty of your body movements. You can lose yourself easily into your dance and you are so comfortable and trusting of your own abilities. For this generation specifically, you have transformed music and given new meaning to what it can and should do for people. You are changing the world each day that you continue to share your artistry and dance; and we are so lucky to be alive right now to get to be a part of the history that you’re making. At the same time that I love your music and dance, I love your personality as well. I love that sometimes you keep to yourself, but other times, you are goofy and outgoing. As I mentioned before, you are extremely freeing to be around and those who spend time with you can relax and be themselves in your presence. I know that nobody can attest to these qualities quite like your members. Seven different personalities, and they all love you and cherish you for their own special reasons. They’ve looked to you and have modeled their perseverance off of how you strive to not let the difficult times hold you down and prevent you from success. You have opened your heart up to all seven people, although you come from different backgrounds, and that has encouraged them to all to have such a loving relationship with one another. You’ve had love for them since you began your journey with them and this has establishing a lifelong love that all of you had before you even debuted. You see the beauty and necessity of every single member and constantly remind them how important they are to Stray Kids. There is likely no greater feeling for them than knowing that they have you by their side if they don’t have anything else. The most important takeaway is the time they spend with you and the way you make them feel, and these are both filled with warm memories they can take with them for the rest of their lives. You’ve already spent some of the happiest and life-changing moments of your life with them, and there is still more to come. The members of Stray Kids, also your brothers and your family, couldn’t have somebody who loves them any more than you do to look after them. You are always so considerate of them and their feelings and respond to them however they need. They are the best versions of themselves because of you and because you love them just the way they are. Now, they can go on to do whatever they aspire to because you’ve encouraged them with that confidence. I want to personally thank your parents and family for raising you and helping you become the person you are today. I know they mean a lot to you, and that you couldn’t be here doing what you are without their love and support. Because of them, you can use your platform to share with the world the same love that they have provided you with your whole life. I hope you never forget that they are always going to be the most proud of you no matter what you do. They love you most in this world and they do so in a way that nobody else understands. Stay love them as you do and we keep them in our hearts as we continue our time with you. We are so grateful to them for bringing you into the world, and for changing the world the same way that you do. Hyunjin, you touch each individual heart of every Stay, and this is easily one of the most charming parts about you. It is in your nature to make each and every Stay feel special, even if you don’t know us personally. You welcome Stay from all around the world with open arms, and I felt as if I was a part of the family my whole life. You are so dedicated to your Stay and this is very apparent in everything that you do, whether it be performing or communicating with us directly. You have so much compassion for Stay and I feel like we are existing in our own separate world with you. Although we all live in different areas across the world, you take us to a place where we can all be one big family together, and it is one of the greatest feelings in the world. What you give to us is irreplaceable, and there could never be another person who helps us see the worth in ourselves the way you do. You also help us love one another. You influence others to treat others with kindness and I’ve met some of the most heartwarming Stay. I know that you help this family become closer every single day, and you remind us that if we have nothing else, we have each other. You invite us into your heart, the same way that you do your members, and you see qualities in us that we don’t even see ourselves. I know for a fact that there are Stay who only believe in themselves because of you. You also share so much of yourself with us, and this is perhaps one of the biggest ways you can show somebody that you trust. As time goes on, I notice you revealing more of yourself through your music and just through direct conversation with your Stay. You have gotten so personal with us and this lets us know just how much you actually believe in us and trust us to keep these parts of you within our hearts. There is no greater honor than to have you place this vulnerable side of you in our hands, and we want to do the same for you. I know that it is not always easy to do this, so I hope you know that we could never mislead you or betray your trust if we wanted to. You are one of the most generous people we know, and we could not be here giving love to others and to you without the love that you gave us first. I know that you’ve been through a lot, both personally, and professionally, and that your time as an idol has not always been easy or enjoyable. You’ve been active for some time now, but during your training period alone, you’ve been met with demanding expectations, which many people cannot even say they’ve undergone. Just as your family is, Stay could not be more proud of you from overcoming your hardships and making it out on the brighter side. Each time you are met with a grueling time or task, thought it make time, you eventually endure through it until the end, and become more experienced. As Stay, I can say we learn so much from how you choose to release stress or convey how you’re feeling through the mediums that provide you comfort.  We are beyond proud of you and continue to learn from you each day. I hope that this birthday makes all of your dreams come true, and you can take the time to truly celebrate who you are as a person. I know it might be difficult to focus on yourself, and if you find this to be the case, I hope you leave it to those who surround you and your admiring fans from all across the world to help you realize how revolutionary of a person you are. You are truly a gifted musician, and a courteous and selfless individual. You deserve this day, and every day that follows, to feel as appreciated as you truly are. I hope that every second is filled with memories that are unforgettable, and that this will be one of the greatest days that you’ve had! Please have fun and celebrate in whatever way you choose, because your Stay will be cheering with you!  Thank you for sacrificing your time, efforts, pain, doubt, fear, tears, emotions, and physical boundaries just to bring us any content at all. For every effort that you put in that you might think is small, a Stay’s mood or day is completely changed for the better. You are blessing to this world and continue to change it every day with how you choose to heal it and the people living in it. I hope you don’t overwork yourself because you are perfect just the way you present yourself to us. We will support you and be there for you for the rest of our lives! I pray that you and your loved ones stay safe, and find happiness and worth in the future. Happy birthday Hyunjin, and we adore you so much!!",4,2022-03-20T05:56:28Z

@cloudypeach7326,okay so i am watching this on a computer while my phone is charging and my computer always glitches a lot unless i get it in the exact right spot which is so hard. Anyway while I was watching this my computer worked perfectly fine and when I clicked out of it to watch some itzy stuff excited that my computer was working but it stopped working so I clicked back into this video and it worked again i was shook and then I clicked on another stray kids video and it worked perfectly and kept on doing it with random stray kids videos and it worked perfectly. Then I watched an ot8 (dont worry I am ot9) video and it stopped working and then I clicked on more ot8 videos and it would not work but any ot9 videos it works perfectly. So yeah it is confirmed my computer is an ot9 stay so we love that. Or stray kids are just gods.,11,2020-04-08T05:10:46Z

The craziest dance I ever saw and I turned out to be crazy so I stayed for a long time staying as a stay and trying to learn this choreo by staying up all night being a stay and so it made me stray, and now I am having crazy side effects of being stray and a stay... 
This have already deep side effects on me!!!

I believed in myself and threw myself in
But why does it only hurt?

Everyone, get out of the way (actually, I)
I’m right (I’m scared)
Everyone, just watch (can I do it?)
I’m afraid I won’t be able to keep my word

Why am I changing, more and more?
My inside and outside are changing
But I’m still getting colored

My head hurts

Nervousness, Insomnia, Nausea, Agitation, Anxiety)

I believed in myself and threw myself in
But why does it only hurt?

Wait, this is strange, it’s getting blurry
Why isn’t this ending? I keep hearing that anxious sound
Even from here
My fighting spirit overflows, I thought I could beat everyone
But not even my rashness can help me endure
Maybe it hurts more because I thought it’d be easy

I used to shout out
I wouldn’t change
But why am I changing endlessly
Depending on my surroundings?

Why do my reactions change
Depending on whoever just passes by?
I used to bop my head if I liked the rhythm
But now I’m doing it cause I’m following someone else
What if my personal tastes change too?

Did I take too much? Now I have more worries than courage

Everything’s changing, from 1 to 10, everything

Without my intention, the side effects keep coming
No no no no

I ignored her and listened to it anyway, it's amazing!!! I didn't even understand it at first, since I don't know Korean, and I just danced to the beat. If you take time to really listen to it, you will enjoy it even more. A lot of people were saying that the beat was bad. Sure it might sound a little basic, but with the rest of the song, the lyrics, it works really well. And even if I didn't like it, I wouldn't try to purposely put the boys down. That's just rude, disrespectful, and plain mean. They are trying their best to create something you enjoy, sometimes even putting it over their health and personal preferences. So by hating on them, your telling them that you don't care about what they do and how hard they try, so try to look and appreciate, before you hate and disrespect. Anyway, if you are a true stay, you should support whatever they do for their band and for you as a fan.",0,2019-06-26T00:58:36Z

@laurabradley9285,"I’m obsessed with this comeback. I’ve been interested in stray kids this year, they seemed very different (I tend to find a lot of boy groups sound the same) and had such a strong fan base. I’m definitely stanning after this. When I watched the mv I was in awe, the song itself isn’t usually my music taste but I added it to my playlist immediately. The meaning, the choreography, the production value, it’s incredible. I got chills watching their comeback stage. Well done Stay Kids, I honestly believe that even if it takes them a couple years, these boys are gonna be the next big thing in kpop.",1,2019-06-23T21:35:36Z

The only con of having such an intricate choreo is that in the live shows the camera doesn't really capture the movement and the overall feeling of the performance (it's a very hard thing to do with so many things happening and like 18 people on stage tho) so I'm so grateful for this video, this really shows the golden parts with smart editing and the Stray Kids vibe that I love so much :) Hope the guys receive some type of award for this performance, everything about it is very well done.

@jackybaduria806,"This performance is on a whole other level! From the vocals, to the raps, to the dances. Everything surprised me from the very start! The power and emotions they put into this one choreography! The amount of meaning they put behind each move. The screams they put into this defining ""head hurts"" and describing the different kinds of things that could hurt your head hurt. Maybe we struggle but we should ignore that. I seriously can relate to all of this. The song itself is amazing! I love the way they try to convey each feeling and emotion into this dance. What is the meaning behind this song and the dance itself? They try to convey those feelings into ""side effects"", the song that can represent us all. Our head hurts a lot. No one is alone on this. We all go through many struggles. I'm happy they're trying new things without being scared. I don't want them to change. Doing what they love and showing how unique they are shows their unique selves. This shows who they truly are as a group. I love how this performance video shows their unique side. I just love how each member each show their own unique color, aura, and charisma. This is why I love Stray Kids. They are very unique with everything they do. They are like no other group at all. Experiencing new things comes to good results. They'll surely improve in the future, I believe in that! I believe in them! They'll surely become the next big thing. _MARKS MY WORDS._ So proud of my boys :( So brave, humble, and powerful! Fighting with you Stray Kids forever! STAYs, let's continue to fight together, fly high together, dream big together, and cherish all of our memories together with our boys! I love you all so much😇❤️ SKZ & STAY Fighting💪

@Karleighdnd,"I know its because they JUST released an album like a month ago so they haven't had much time to do this one but the choreo is very plain and I would expect more from the people I KNOW can do so much more, you know? SOme parts of the dance are slow and most parts are them walking or doing something simple. This entire group can do more than just walking! Also I'm in dance Majorettes and guard and when I would have to do something like this (change the way I dance or twirl to something more simple) It is so stressful plus they have MANY stays watching them and judging them. THIS comeback had to have been so stressful and I really hope it is giving them a BIT of  a break. 
1:38 this is a part were it is like the way the regularly dance and im not saying that they ALWAYS have to dance like they ALWAYS do. They deserve a break but this comeback was a drastic change from Miroh. PROPS to them for trying something new but Im sure it has something to do with the times of the albums. I think that they should have more time in between. We can be patient stay. Quality over QUANTITY

@hyunjinnation,"*This performance stands out so much because it's more than just -""dancing to the beat""-, if you really listen to the lyrics whilst watching the dance, the movements during most parts reflect deeply in the lyrics like when Felix hit his head with his fist saying his ""head hurts"" and suddeny the dance break goes all irrevocably complex, depicting a migraine or the internal feeling during a headache. They've managed to draw so many pictures with this choreography and they managed to do the movements so precisely even with a lot of people (usually it's just 9 of them but now they also obviously had to train and teach the back-up dancers).*

@sb8922,"The beat of this song goes in the rhythm of the pounding sensation you feel when you experience a headache.

The lower energy moments of this song seem represent either the buildup of the “pounding” sensation that comes with the side effects.
Or it could represent that whoever is feeling the “side effects” is beginning to realize the problem.


The climax is finally where the side effects get so severe that they just can’t handle it anymore.


Thus, leading to 

“My head hurts.”




Stray Kids didn’t expect to feel this way once they entered Clé.

They thought that as long as they were together, they could beat all odds.

But that didn’t  mean there won’t be other obstacles in the way.

So, they weren’t prepared. They are going crazy.
Which leads to experiencing “Side Effects”",0,2019-06-23T15:21:50Z
