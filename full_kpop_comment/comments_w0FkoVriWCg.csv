이 노래 들리니 우리가 누군지 궁금해?
한 번도 본 적 없는 우리가 누군지 궁금해?
작은 손 잡은 서롤 믿고있어 그 믿음으로 우릴 만들고 있어
조금만 기다려줘 멋지게 우릴 보여줄게
내 목소리 들리니 아무도 들려주지 않은 노래
앞이 보이지 않는 너와 나를 위로하는 노래
너와 나 잡은 손에 내일이 있어 두 눈에 품은 빛을 가릴 수 없어
조금만 기다려줘 멋지게 우릴 보여줄게
두려워 흔들리는 일은 없을 거야 너의 미소에 내 모든걸 맡길 테니
두 귀에 나를 담아
이 노래 들리니 우리가 누군지 궁금해?
한 번도 본 적 없는 우리가 누군지 궁금해?

2017ver  :  우지(이지훈),  승관(부승관), 정한(윤정한), 도겸(이석민), 조슈아( 홍지수/Joshua Jisoo Hong)

이 노래 들리면 그때의 우리를 기억해
이제는 추억이 된 그때의 우리를 기억해
작은 손 잡은 서로를 믿고있어 그 믿음으로 우릴 만들고 있어
앞으로도 영원히 멋지게 너를 빛내줄게
내 목소리 들리니 다시 한 번 불러보는 노래
눈 앞에 니가 있어 이젠 웃으며 부르는 노래
너와 나 잡은 손에 내일이 있어 두 눈에 품은 빛은 가릴 수 없어
앞으로도 영원히 멋지게 너를 빛내줄게
두려워 흔들리는 일은 없을 거야 너의 미소에 내 모든걸 맡길 테니 baby
두 귀에 나를 담아
이 노래 들리면 그때의 우리를 기억해
이제는 추억이 된 그때의 우리를 기억해

+아니 2014버전 보다가 2017 딱 듣자마자 가사 달라서 소름이 오소소 돋아버림,,,,내가 17년 버전으로 3년이나 지났는데 별 생각 없이 들었다는 것도 좀 어이가 없음 그리고 가사가 14버전에는 앞으로 데뷔해서 좋은 그룹으로 보여줄테니까 기대해줘랑 이제 막 본인들을 보여주는 느낌이면 17년 버전은 데뷔해서 지금까지 연차가 쌓이면서 캐럿들이 응원하고 위로해 줬으니 우리도 캐럿 응원하고 위로 해줄테니까 기대해줘 같은 느낌에 울컥했음,,,데뷔초 때나 연습생때 누구보다 열심히 한거 아니까 진짜 지금 다시보니까 너무 슬프고 내가 앞으로도 사랑할 그룹이라는 게 너무 자랑스럽고 고마워서 들으면서 세봉이들한테 너무 고맙다는 생각이 들었음,,,앞으로도 좋은 음악 좋은 무대로 더욱 성장하고 세봉이들이 정말 많이 힘들어할 일은 없었으면 좋겠다는 바람이 있다,,,,사랑해,,,,진짜 평생 노래해줘,,,",1,2020-12-15T05:10:00Z

We We gonna make it shine


이 노래 들리면 그때의 우리를 기억해
この歌が聞こえると あの時の僕らを思い出す

이제는 추억이 된 그때의 우리를 기억해
今は思い出になった あの時の僕らを思い出す


작은 손 잡은 서로를 믿고 있어
小さな手は 互いを信じている

그 믿음으로 우리를 만들고 있어
その信頼で 僕らを築いている

앞으로도 영원히 멋지게 너를 빛내줄게
これからも永遠に カッコよく君を輝かせてあげるよ



We We gonna make it shine
 

내 목소리 들리니 다시 한 번 불러보는 노래
僕の声が聞こえる？ もう一度歌ってみる歌

눈 앞에 니가 있어 이젠 웃으며 부르는 노래
目の前に君がいる 今は笑いながら歌う歌


너와 나 잡은 손에 내일이 있어
君と僕が繋いだ手に 明日はある

두 눈에 품은 빛은 가릴 수 없어
目に抱いた光は遮ることはできない
 

앞으로도 영원히 멋지게 너를 빛내줄게
これからも永遠に 君を輝かせてあげるよ


두려워 흔들리는 일은 없을거야
怖くて震えることはないだろう

너의 미소에 내 모든 걸 맡길테니 baby
君の笑顔に僕の全てを委ねるから baby

두 귀에 나를 담아
耳に僕の声を


이 노래 들리면 그때의 우리를 기억해

I know this comment is late, but I love these guys since debut, but I didn't have the chance to watch this. When I listen to this song, how the lyric changes, I was, emotional.
I cried listening to this unlike how I listen to this before. Because, now, I knew how SVT loved us, Carats. I also loved them, we did. All they want to say to us is ""Thank you."" I do want to say it to them... But when will I have the chance? I want to meet them so much, but I think, how will that happen? I love you SEVENTEEN,

As an international CARAT, I never thought I would be so proud of people that I can't even understand all of the time (My 한글 is still very weak) I have followed you from debut and until now. Would you look at how much you have grown? Would you look at who you've become? You're inspiring, beautiful, and generous boys. Everyone has improved so much over such a SHORT period of time. Joshua and Jeonghan were once sub-vocals, as is their position, but they are no longer sub-vocals. Every voice in Seventeen is strong and they really all sound like one big unit now. You've come so far, I've never been so proud to be a fan. 세븐틴 FOREVER ❤ 세븐틴 사랑해요.",2,2017-08-07T10:46:26Z

@orangecreamsicle4374,"Watching this in comparison to the old video makes me so happy. Everyone's improvement is clearly audible (despite Jeonghan and Joshua not being in the original but I'll compare them to other predebut songs). 
Seungkwan sounds /so/ effortless and amazing and his vocal technique is so good and I'm so proud. In the past he had to strain his voice to get his power and he's gotten over that (if only I could too lol)! 
DK's vocal technique has improved so much too and he uses more breath support here and has so much more control over his voice. The falsetto notes near the end are so much easier for him now! 
Woozi's voice is also so much more developed! He's gotten rid of so much nasality and his tone is a lot clearer now! His technique has improved too and he can sing much louder now. 
Now Joshua and Jeonghan's voices--comparing them to predebut, they've improved so much! They had the least vocal training in my opinion, and Hoshi was better them for quite a while predebut. But their growth is really obvious here. Jeonghan used to struggle with nasality but he's really fixed it! He has much more control over his voice. He's now capable of some belting despite not doing it here. :3
And Joshua was in my opinion a naturally talented singer but just hadn't built his skills yet. He definitely has started building them now! He's had to sing out of his natural range (ie in falsettos) for many of his lines through the years but he's obviously been developing his chest voice (basically regular vocal range) a bit more regardless. I can hear an overall improvement in his vocal technique as compared to Boom Boom era! Not a specific thing but just everything in general. 

Guys, the vocal unit is so talented. They work so hard and their harmonies are amazing. I love Seventeen but vocal unit has the #1 spot in my heart. :3",5,2017-08-07T04:21:27Z

@yoyopabo,"It's so interesting that they composed the new version with the organ. It kind of matches with the remembering feel of the new song^^ I also liked the part where they harmonized, but I think I liked it more in the original. I think they just switched the volumes of the different harmonies though... and the camera work was better in the original too. But I love both versions of this song!! seventeen are too awesome! I love that they never stop looking back and improving! covering their own songs... It really makes them artists different from the rest :D Can't wait to see them in concert!!

@yukiitoi6002,"Here's a short oneshot from the song.
You were walking along the corridors of the school, when you heard a sound from the music room. Curious, you opened the door to hear the faint voices clearer. 

""Ohhh, we gonna make it shine."" 

""Are you curious as to who we are after hearing this song?""

""We, we gonna make it shine.""

""Are you curious as to who we are even not having seen us?""

""We, we gonna make it shine.""

You remember being with your past best friends walking with them hand in hand. Unbreakable. That was before though. Before when the faith in each other wasn't broken yet. Before, when they haven't changed into a ""cooler"", a better them, as they'd like to address it. Before when they didn't change into someone their not, just to fit in. 

""We, we gonna make it shine.""

""Do you hear my voice? Anyone that doesn't hear this song.""

""We, we gonna make it shine.""

""In the future the music will comfort you and I.""

You started tearing up. The thing that first connected you with them was music. You and the guy's love for music was the same as your love for each other. Music was the reason you met them, music was how you mended problems that occurred.

""As long as you hold my hand, there is tomorrow, can't hide the light from both your eyes. Just wait a little longer. We'll show you a cooler us."" 

You remember your promises with them. 

""We, we gonna make it shine.""

""There is not a day that we shake fearfully. I'll leave it all with your smile, baby."" 

You definitely miss their smiles, no doubt about that. They always gave you the most genuine eye smiles ever.

""Listen to me with your two ears.""

You smiled through your tears. Seokmin used to always tell you that whenever you were being immature.

""Are you curious as to who we are after hearing this song?""

""We, we gonna make it shine.""

""Are you curious as to who we are even not having seen us?""

""We, we gonna make it shine.""

""Ohhh, we gonna make it shine."" 

The song ended. And yes, you were very curious as to who made you feel that way. You finally opened the door to the music room. The five guys turned to look at you.

Shock was evident in both parties. It was none other than your very own ""past"" bestfriends.",1,2017-08-06T11:13:05Z

@a_lost_staysider,...AHHH HOLY COWS OMG NO WONDER DK WAS SANG IT RECENTLY. NAWWW BUT NO HOSHI cuz jeonghan and josh are now vocal. Remember when hoshi was part of the vocal unit and woozi was part of the perf. unit but also a vocal....and vernon was also a perf unit member. They even kept the same/similar setting T_T REMEMBER WOOZIS CHEEKS. REMEMBER SEUNGKWANS CHEEKS. REMEMBER JEONGHANS REALLY SHORT HAIR AND JOSHUA AND HIS MAC BOOK AND DK AND HOSHI WHEN SOONSEOK WAS FIRST CREATED AND THEY WERE DOING THE WEIRDEST STUFF...THEY STILL ARE,1,2017-08-06T10:55:54Z
