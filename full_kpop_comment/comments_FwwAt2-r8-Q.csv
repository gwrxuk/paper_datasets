@stfu492,"The song “Bittersweet” expresses the conflict between the sweetness of newly-discovered love and the sting of friendship among a group of three longtime friends by tracing the delicate trails of emotion to the place where they cross. WONWOO and MINGYU helped write the lyrics, which illustrates the dilemma “between love and friendship.”Featuring in the song with her unrivaled vocal timbre is artist Lee Hi, adding a sense of maturity to WONWOO and MINGYU’s masculine vocals. The result is such perfect musical chemistry that this highlight is not to be missed.",14,2023-12-10T09:45:56Z

@LoLoToTo920,"How did love become love
I get close, it goes farther
Sorry I can’t get closer
I’m sorry I’m like this umm umm
One you and two moons
Hiding the truth, pretending I’m fine
I’m hiding in the rain always smiling
Woo I want an answer
That I don’t think I can find
I want the next thing
But anything, nothing
Is like the heart of a person
Eyes meeting but hearts apart
So sweet and so bitter
If I give my hand and expect your heart
My selfishness grows to a flaw
Filling the void between us
Filling the heart with more emptiness
Touch of a season passed-by
Scent of a moment fill both hands
I stand still before you before me
I’m okay, not okay
But anything, nothing
Is like the heart of a person
Eyes meeting but hearts apart
So sweet and so bitter
Ruinous imagination consumes me
Makes me dream sweeter dreams
I close my eyes but thoughts of you
Bring turmoil to night, to you and me, real and dreamy
But anything, nothing
Is like the heart of a person
Eyes meeting but hearts apart
So sweet and so bitter
Don’t want to let go so I let go
You and me we see together
Will our eyes ever meet each other
Don’t want to let go so I let go
You and me we see together",0,2021-05-29T13:30:58Z

@halinhngoc,"사랑은 어쩌다 사랑이 됐을까

가까워지면 멀어져서
다가서지 못해서 더 미안해
이런 내가 싫다 Umm, umm
너 하나와 두 개의 달

진심을 숨기고서 괜찮은 척
빗속에 난 숨어 늘 웃고 있어
Woo 찾지 못할 것만 같은
답을 바라고 있어
그다음을 바라면서

그 무엇도 그 무엇도
사람 마음 같지 않아서
같은 시선 다른 마음
너무 달고 너무 쓰다

내 손을 건네주고서 마음을 기대하면
이기심은 커져 결함이 돼
우리 사이의 빈틈을 채우고
채울수록 마음의 빈칸은 더 비워져

그렇게 스쳐 간 계절의 감촉과
찰나의 향기를 두 손 안에 쥐여주고
내 앞에 있는 너 그 앞에 멈춰서
I'm okay, not okay

그 무엇도 그 무엇도
사람 마음 같지 않아서
같은 시선 다른 마음
너무 달고 너무 쓰다

우리를 끝없이 망칠 상상은 날 삼켜
더욱더 단꿈을 꾸게 해
눈 감아도 너의 생각 때문에
밤이 소란스러워 현실과 꿈의 너와 나

그 무엇도 그 무엇도
사람 마음 같지 않아서
같은 시선 다른 마음
너무 달고 너무 쓰다

놓쳐 버리기 싫어서 너를 놓아
같은 곳을 바라보던 너와
서로가 마주 볼 수 있을까
놓쳐 버리기 싫어서 너를 놓아
같은 곳을 바라보던 너와",0,2021-05-29T12:16:21Z

@AllanAumento,Omg the vocal nirvana that just assaulted my ears in such a good way..... how can they be so good??? This is overflowing with visuals and a tension that really sells this song. I love the side by side where a few times it looks like Mingyu’s focus slowly drifts towards Wonwoo but he looks away real fast...I think it happens twice at 00:52 and 02:26. I wonder if it’s a cool planned thing considering the song’s subject. Chef’s kiss.,0,2021-05-29T12:12:10Z
