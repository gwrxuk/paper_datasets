@h-playwithmyhart.4806,"Amber Liu. The first time I ever saw you, it was through my older sister who was, and still is, absolutely obsessed with FX. I have been a K-Pop fan for about a decade now, but at this time, at least 5 years ago, I wasn’t acquainted with many groups. I saw the absolute glow in my sister’s eyes as she showed me endless FX music videos and talked about each member with such love and inspiration woven into each of her words. Since then, I have been a huge supporter and fan of FX, and I have grown alongside you during your most difficult and triumphant times. I know that you have been through a lot, and even saying that doesn’t even come to close to what you must have been feeling for the past several years. I know you have been in the business and making music for a very long time now, and I know you have experienced extreme tragedy as well as glorifying victories. I have never seen someone respond to any obstacles in the mature and hopeful manner that you have. That, as I’ve gotten to know more about you over the years, might be what I appreciated the most about you. I am so aware why so many people, including my sister who introduced me to you, are so inspired by you and desperate to follow in your footsteps. Amidst all of the pain you have felt, sacrifice you have made, and challenges you have faced, you continue to make barrier-breaking music and share your voice with the world through that music. Your response to the problems in the world is so wholesome, genuine and confident; and you have taught many around the world how to effectively recover from any pain they may have felt. It can be understood that you have gone through what many have not, and yet you have not given up on living out your dreams and encouraging others to follow in your footsteps. What has always stood out to me is that you have always been confident, and done what has been best for you, rather than listen to others. You always came off as so comfortable in your own skin, and that makes you such an iconic performer and musician. Your powerful and bold rapping, combined with your soulful, smooth, and energetic voice makes you an incredibly compassionate performer who is so connected to her audience and music on stage. You are an unbelievably beautiful dancer and have such a demanding stage presence that has been such a privilege for me to watch over these years. I know that your fans love you in a way that’s stronger than anybody else ever could. You have given them a reason not to give up trying when the worst happens to them, and there is no higher form of inspiration than that. I am proud to be one of these fans, and I know my sister is as well. Similarly, your members love you and have such an unbreakable bond with you that I have seen firsthand without even knowing any of you personally. I know that you have all relied on each other in such a way that most people can’t say they know or understood, and I can’t even speak on how unique your relationship is with one another. I can’t even thank you enough for coming into my life and showing me confidence, strength, and reliance on my passion, friends, and family in the darkest times in my life. You are an inspiration like no other, and I know all of the fans, and even those outside of them can recognize as such a once-in-a-lifetime authentic musician. On behalf of your friends, fans, members, and most importantly, your loving and adoring family, I wish you the most blessed birthday ever Amber. I hope nothing but love surrounds you and those close to you always and forever. Please stay safe, and I pray that you continue to live your life in such bliss as you do now and have always tried to. I absolutely love you so, so much, and Happy Birthday! I hope you have as much fun as you possibly can! We adore you so much and never give up on your once-in-a-lifetime artistry. Be safe, and praying for the happiness and health of you and your loved ones always.",7,2022-09-18T21:48:58Z

@garciaerlennrose1799,"So I recently watched Itzy's new MV - Sneakers, and there's a tone from that song that really bothered me (not in the bad way, no) the lyrics goes, ""Yeah alright"" and it has been running on my mind for an entire day. I was thinking ""this sound seems so familiar.."" but I can't point out from what song I heard it from. I just know that it was also from a KPop song. And just know, I realized that the familiarity came from this song of Amber, where Tiffany goes, ""yeah... Uh-huh"" HAHAHA I hope I make sense, but I am finally happy that I get answers from my own question",11,2022-07-19T17:36:40Z

@nachochip1778,너무 좋아서 입꼬리랑 광대 승천함 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 언닝 넘 좋아 예전에도 생각했지만 아이돌치고 자유로워보여서 더 좋아.. 언니 항상 행복했음 좋겠다. 이 곡 나왔을 땐 어렸고 함수 나왔을 때 남자냐 여자냐 말 많았는데 지금은 언니가 유별난 게 아니라 오히려 사람다운 상태로 살았던 걸 알게됐어. 어릴 때도 태연이랑 언니랑 번갈아나오는데 의상은 극과 극이라 왜 다르지? 궁금했던 게 생각나는데 그땐 그정도 의문만 가졌지 그 이상을 생각할 순 없었어. 머리 짧고 활동성 좋은 옷 입는다고 한국에선 남자 외국에선 톰보이라고 말하는 거 참 지긋지긋하다. 보는 나도 그런데 함수활동하면서 그런 시비는 끝도없이 들었을 게 뻔해서 마음이 아프네. 많은 아이돌이나 일반인 여자들이 언니같이 활동성 좋은 옷을 입고 메이크업 압박도 개인적으로나 사회적으로나 줄어들면 좋겠어. 나도 중학생 때 머리 조금 짧게 잘랐었는데 흔히 말하는 여성숏컷이었음에도 불구하고 남자냐는 말 많이 들었거든. 이상한 애 보는 듯한 눈빛이 싫어서 결국 머리 길렀었는데... 언니가 끝까지 남들의 강요나 꼽주는거에 굴하지 않고 원하는 스타일을 지킨 게 정말 얼마나 대단한 일인지 모르겠어. 성인이 되고 대학가면서 하지도 않던 화장하고 꾸미고 그랬다가 이제는 다 버렸는데 그 과정이 쉽진 않았거든? 나도 언니처럼 살고 싶었나봐. 언제쯤 편한 머리에 편한 옷 입으면 남자라고 하지 않는 사회가 될까? 그래도 점점 인식이 변하는 것 같아. 탈코르셋이라는 거 어릴 적엔 상상도 못했던 생각인데 무의식적으로는 편안한 옷을 입고싶고 나를 검열하려는 시선들에서 벗어나고 싶었던 것 같아. 내 어린 시절부터 지금까지 항상 함께해줘서 고마워. 이름부터 보석인 언니가 항상 행복하기만 하다면 그걸로 충분할거야. 늘 건강하고 즐겁게 살자. 🥰,66,2022-02-10T13:42:22Z

You always came off as so comfortable in your own skin, and that makes you such an iconic performer and musician. Your powerful and bold rapping, combined with your soulful, smooth, and energetic voice makes you an incredibly compassionate performer who is so connected to her audience and music on stage. You are an unbelievably beautiful dancer and have such a demanding stage presence that has been such a privilege for me to watch over these years. I know that your fans love you in a way that’s stronger than anybody else ever could. You have given them a reason not to give up trying when the worst happens to them, and there is no higher form of inspiration than that. I am proud to be one of these fans, and I know my sister is as well. Similarly, your members love you and have such an unbreakable bond with you that I have seen firsthand without even knowing any of you personally. I know that you have all relied on each other in such a way that most people can’t say they know or understood, and I can’t even speak on how unique your relationship is with one another. I can’t even thank you enough for coming into my life and showing me confidence, strength, and reliance on my passion, friends, and family in the darkest times in my life. You are an inspiration like no other, and I know all of the fans, and even those outside of them can recognize as such a once-in-a-lifetime authentic musician. On behalf of your friends, fans, members, and most importantly, your loving and adoring family, I wish you the most blessed birthday ever Amber. I hope nothing but love surrounds you and those close to you always and forever. Please stay safe, and I pray that you continue to live your life in such bliss as you do now and have always tried to. I absolutely love you so, so much, and Happy Birthday! I hope you have as much fun as you possibly can!",9,2021-09-18T08:54:48Z

Laughed pretty much through it all. & the fact that she got a fellow ""f/x"" musician to sing certain parts of the song, was an ingenious move. Looking forward to more of her solo work.

@newportbot7709,"John, accept it. It's a fact. K-Pop isn't a music genre. It's a cultural sinkhole. You're actively worsening society as a whole with your degeneracy. Idolizing and worshipping generic, autotuned artists based on their identity instead of their musical talent harms the global music industry. Ever heard of an ugly Korean singer? I didn't think so, John. Your support of this industry propogates harmful beauty standards across impressionable youth worldwide which leads to poor mental health and eating disorders. Do you want that, John? Didn't think so, asshole.",0,2019-07-28T04:47:32Z

Instead of just doing nothing and hoping everything would fix itself, let's flood SM social media accounts (Instagram, Facebook, etc) with the hashtag(s) #amberisenough #dontneglectamber #justiceforamber. As Me(U)s we don't want to see our llama be ignored like this. It's time we take action for them, and be the true fans we are. Amber has been creating music for us to enjoy, to relate to, and has been working her butt off for the content she creates. She takes a huge amount of effort, and it's a shame SM ignores this. 

If SM isn't going to listen to Amber, then we're going to have to force them to listen 👊🏼.",0,2017-03-28T02:48:10Z

""Jackson wang!!"" - yes sweetheart we can all see jackson.
""Why does she look like a boy?"" - sweetie, theres a thing called a Tomboy. Tomboys usually dont take offense  when people ask why they look like a boy, but im gonna be 1 of those people and take it out on you. GIRLS DONT HAVE TO WEAR FKING HIGH HEELS AND CROP TOPS! Amber and anyone can express themselves the way they want and u shouldn't feel the need to ask why a girl is wearing boys clothes and has short hair.

I found this video and about Taeyeon when the news about her and Baekhyun came. She looks smokinggg. The long black hair makes her look extremely attractive, like hot and sexy, whereas blonde makes her looks cute and pretty. At first I thought she was some kind of hot and a diva person since she looks extremely hot in this video, but she's literally the opposite ahahha.",36,2016-06-05T15:35:18Z

It is her talent in singing and rapping that makes her the best among the female KPoP artists. She is not just a llama but she is also a chameleon because she is able to blend in in the chaotic music and showbiz industry. In short, she's a total package.

@tasa5832,"n the music video: Korean-government asks bosses and leaders to be good example for their followers. Followers will not follow the rules if their bosses are violators. Being as leader turns you from normal person to someone represent Korean-government. Therefore, many people consider you as a mirror reflects Korean-government vision and mission.

@HeyVenusss,"I cant believe how delusional some people are. NOOO AMBER DID NOT CREATE THE WHIP and nae nae. If you do research the nae nae was created by We Are Toonz in a song called ""Drop That Nae Nae"" in 2013 and then the whip was made in 2014 if you search up #whipdance on youtube. Then Silento made the song ""Watch Me"" in 2015 to mash up both of the dances but not cooying Amber and he probably never even heard of Amber because he got much more popular. Also Amber made her song in 2015 also but she just incorporated the naenae and whip into her dance routine doesnt mean she made it though....",0,2016-02-03T16:14:43Z

@MiriaJiyuu,"To anyone who has gotten offended by people asking if Amber is a boy or a girl....

She can look like a boy or girl. I know who Amber is and I've still been fooled by her wearing a suit in a crowd for a second before I realize it's her. She has some feminine features and some masculine ones and overall someone who doesn't know her could easily think she's male or female, depending on where you look first. The astounding number of people who think she's a guy a first should tell you that maybe there's something about the way she carries herself can make her seem male. 

Don't get so offended by it, instead just inform them she's a girl. CURE their ignorance instead of making fun of them. There's never a need to be an asshole about something. Not everyone can easily tell she's a girl, not everyone has the same background knowledge you do.

If I saw just an image from this video with no sound and no idea what I was looking at (as in I know nothing about KPop), in particular the final image with her arm around Taeyeon would really do it,  I would totally think she's a guy. Hell I might even ask if her and Taeyeon were dating.

Anyway point is, be nice and don't take something so small so personally. It's really not as obvious as some of you think.",0,2015-11-06T16:45:49Z

@josephinechen7749,"I don't listen to kpop music just this month google Amber caught my attention realised she is one of the group member in fx. Have started listen to a few of her group songs because of her. This first mini album was great her voice was unique can hear her feeling that is her true self she put in alot of effort by writing the lyrics and composed songs in her own album which is rare in kpop industry, She is multi talented can rap, sing, dance, composed songs , write lyrics even MCs. Now finally her hidden potential is shown and she proof it she can sing very well not just rap her duel with Eric Nam blend in so well too cant even recognize is her voice, Hope she can have more sing part and more rap part too in her group song cant hear enough of her sing and rap part. It doesn't really matters whether she wear boyish clothes as long she is comfortable she has the charismatic/suave look that draw alot of attention from fangirls in her group even guys too feel comfortable get along with her cause of her character. Hope she can have her second mini album next year really hope she can at least win an award for her next album she really sing very well and composed the song well in this album hope SM can promote her next album more and also at least two or more mv to be shown in this album just one mv is not enough. :)",0,2015-08-24T03:05:07Z

You have to be nuts if you expect him not to date anyone other than yourself, because face it, it's not happening. What's not to love about her? She's kind, beautiful and an amazing singer (plus baek is a total SNSD fangirl). If Amber didn't want her in her song she wouldn't have had her in it. Simple. Don't say she's taking over the song because she isn't. It says featuring Taeyeon, so of course she is going to be incorporated all throughout. That's what featured means. Tae deserves better than this. I'm kinda sick of all this pointless hating.",1,2015-07-19T03:58:24Z

Personally I think Amber should've gone to YG instead to suit her genre more but then f(x) wouldn't have been the same and so far they're the only kpop girl group I like the most (2ne1 think they're the bombs and shits Miss A are OK but I dunno) GO ON AMBER!!! *AFF(x)TIONIST*,0,2015-07-07T11:40:22Z

Especially Taeyeon's part.. it didn't really go with the rest of the song (she slayed her part though, her voice is just asdfghjkl) but I don't know T__T Maybe it's just me :/",0,2015-07-07T05:03:00Z

Like Ga-in, VIXX, Infinite, 2NE1, Miss A, Spica, Ft. Island and many more...anyway, that's how I learned about F/X's Amber, my Ultimate Bias Key was on We Got Married Global 2 almost a year ago & ever since I've been curious about Amber singularly. plus Tasty and Gott7. Now that Amber has a solo project I thought I'd check her out. I wasn't even surprised that I loved her  song within seconds of hearing it. I mean it's fresh, upbeat, the type of song to elevate my mood. More please:) I also love rap in Kpop and Amber's flow just put her own my list of albums to buy this summer.

@EuzeoAipnak,I love this song and Amber! However one thing did bother me. Did Amber write this song? Or chose it? Did she confirm that she is a lesbian? If the answer to these questions is no then I definitely find it disrespectful of SM to chose a song that implies she's talking to a girl just because she's a tomboy. If anyone finds this offensive then go ahead and be offended.,0,2015-04-22T21:46:44Z

@Thekpopgeek2,"F(X) is probably one of the most well respected groups in Kpop. I don't get why SM treats them like shit. F(X) is like 5-6 years old (scene debut) and they don't even hav a fan club name yet they never even got like there own tour even though SHINee did and they are only a year older than F(X). like WTF SM? Do us a favour and get your shit together! and I swear to god if Red Velvet get's a fan club name before F(X) i'm gonna freak! Cuz RV is only like 8 months old (i think anyways) I love RV and everything but F(X) needs a fan club name first. I'm still kind of mad that EXO got theres before F(x) and there only 3 years old...

@tenkolee,"So one day I was bored. I turned on our ps4 which is hooked up to our tv in the living room and was watching Amber's MV on it. My older brother who only knows about a few Kpop singers, especially Ailee and Lee Hyori, approached the tv and was like "" who's that?"" I told him ""its Amber from F(x) who is the first member to go solo."" I then proceed to ask, ""so, do you think she is a girl or guy?"" He looks at me and goes ""well duh if anyone can tell it's a girl. What kind of guy would go by the name Amber. That's obviously a girl's name."" I literally laughed at his response and said, ""well most people think she's a guy because the way she is dressed."" My brother then proceeds to say, ""well those people who think like that are either dumb in nature because they can't comprehend that 'Amber' is a feminine name or either blind as fucking hell.""(looks at TV) Woot way to tell me big bro. The only time I actually agreed with my older brother. ",221,2015-04-21T03:33:00Z

@tziporah9788,"The song is somewhat catchy and overall os good. Very sad to hear people can't respect Amber's choice of short hair and ""boyish cloths"" (cloths do not define someone's gender..?) as well as people using the wrong pronouns for Amber. I think that one of the only things that I find just ironically funny is that in this video, Amber incorporates the Whip Dance, and the Nae Nae, BOTH originating from African Americans late last year early this year(youtube it), and yet there are still many Koreans (not all of course) that are racist/prejudiced to black people or do not like black people despite their idols getting their dances and beats from them. There's a song where the artist goes ""now watch me whip. Now watch me nae nae"" and they do both dances in that order exactly like Amber's song.

Idk :// it just upsets me when people take from other cultures when people of their population don't even fully reconize me, my family, and my friends as a race as well as other cultures in general.

However the song is nice, and the dance is nice. If you like those two dances in particular for being ""original"", support the African American community and look at some African Americans dancing to it. :)

Not here to fight, but I AM here to spread word that this isn't something that Amber's dance choreographer invented him/herself. :]",0,2015-04-10T13:05:39Z

@9Fashionista411,"I love taeyeon, but I feel the video producers did a bad job trying to implement taeyeon in this video.  She just seems out of place and throws off the fun and silly vibe of the video.  Maybe it's because amber and everyone else is giving off a silly, fun party vibe and they're all together, but there are just random shots of taeyeon on a throne ALL BY HERSELF :( with a more ""serious"" vibe in her video shots :P I feel if taeyeon was shown singing AND acting silly and partying with everyone else she wouldn't look so out of place, and just let herself go ya know?! lol. great song though, I love the both of them so much!",0,2015-03-25T16:25:02Z

It's not like you're going to move to South Korea, magically meet your bias and live happily ever after in your married life. Sorry to kill any hope, but you've got to be realistic. It's great being a fangirl and absolutely loving someone (( Sehun, T.O.P and Taemin, I'm looking at you )), but going to the extent of hating on one of them for even having a relationship is pathetic.
Amber and Taeyeon are amazing together, please, grow up and stop hating on them. People like this make me ashamed to be a K-Pop fan. Seriously.

Also I see some negative comments about Taeyeon's appearance, but remember that Amber was the one who invited her to film this. So if you are criticizing Taeyeon, you are also in a way criticizing Amber - since it was her decision. ;~ ; 
But more importantly, Jackson though. His face @2:27//dying

But I will support her always no matter what as long as she feels happy and comfortable with herself. And I wouldn't blame her for doing that just by seeing how intolerant almost all Korean people are towards all the LGBT subject, if she came out maybe it would mean the end of her career as an artist in Korea but she has to know that there will always be people who are going to support her no matter what (:",0,2015-03-03T02:52:20Z

@NowhereBeats,"Anyone else think the arrangement is what is stopping this from being a really great song?

1. The part at 0:56 which also appeared at 1:52 should only have appeared in once, having it twice killed the momentum.

2. The whole chorus.
---Tae's vocals (if 'ha-ha' counts as vocals) in the chorus should not have been there.
---The slow down in the instruments on the 4th bar totally ruins the feel too.
---That na-na-na-na part is unlistenable for me, the song would instantly be miles better without it.

3. That 'I want you too' was such a waste of time, a third verse by Amber would have been suitable.

4. It would have been nice to hear Amber rapping along side Taeyeon, rather just having ad-libbed 'uh huh'. 

5. Not an arrangement problem, but the bells in the instrumental ruin it.

Amber is a girl. get it, but she feels Comfortable Acting and Dressing this way, there`s nothing wrong with it.
Also, Taeyoens voice is just so Annoying, She only keeps adding those Uh and Ahh or something. We cannot even see Amber when they keep showing us taeyoen. And its like they want to show that Amber cant be like taeyoen with such looks. So Rude.",0,2015-02-28T12:27:07Z

@brambleheart1818,"I absolutely adore this song and love Amber to death, but Taeyeon's voice wasn't, in lack of better wording, strong enough for this song.
No hate on Taeyeon, I like her and all, it's just her voice wasn't compatible for a song like this and didn't stand out enough as it should've against the loud trumpets.
A good example would be at 2:38. Her voice sounded soft and kind of distorted the picture in my head of the song. However, her solo was good, though I would've like her vocalization part (3:03) to have ended on a higher note instead of letting it go lower by two notes or so. It would've given the next chorus a bit more pump and adrenaline. Not gonna lie, she blended nicely with the chorus and Amber.
I understand that SMent. was trying to play it smart as Amber isn't the most popular of f(x) in Korea and while I agree that Taeyeon brought a lot more views to this video than if Amber was alone, I would've just liked someone with a bolder voice singing.
Remember, this is just the personal preference of a thirteen year-old nobody.",0,2015-02-27T23:46:41Z

@Adoredbyothers,GEEZ FUCKING KRISUS FOR ALL U IGNORANT NOT KNOWING SHIT PEOPLE AMBER IS A GIRL. she screams tomboy all over yes but that's fucking it. It is so obvious she's a girl. Maybe it's because I was born in the early 90s. Where a tomboy is called a tomboy. A Lesbian Is a Lesbian. A gay is a gay. And so on and so forth but that is it. Nothing more nothing less. Like why does society now have to label people in such shitty ways? It used to be so simple and now everyone has to question everything. When I look at amber I see a girl who likes to wear boy clothes and play in the dirt.  I USED TO BE THE SAME! I hated dresses I hated skirts I hated makeup and everything else I just wanted to climb trees and play football. But guess what I still liked boys I still wanted to look cute for them etc. Why can't it still be like that? I'm so sick of the way people think nowadays it's really disgusting. ESPECIALLY WHEN PEOPLE QUESTION ABOUT SOMEONE WHO HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM AND IT'S NONE OF THEIR DAMN BUSINESS! I hope and pray that when I have kids I raise them to not judge or question someone's personal choices and let them live the way they choose. And learn that you don't have to agree with it but you need to accept it. ,0,2015-02-26T14:12:31Z

This MV is awesome, well to me it is anyways! :) this MV is colorful, bright and really catchy and poppy, along with the simple dance movements. If I remember correctly when I first knew about Kpop, it was defined quite similarly to what this MV is like, Amber did put in her style and made it really fun. It was cool to see a huge variety of idol appearances in the MV, which you don't get to see often. 
Also, no hate on Taeyeon, she's a great singer with amazing vocals that went with the song. 'Shake That Brass' is one of my favorite songs to listen to cos it gives me such a happy vibe that I can't really explain. 
All in all, just enjoy the video and shake that brass!! ^^ <3 ",0,2015-02-26T13:39:56Z

@angryblossom2644,"I really love Amber, and her single is amazing! But, I do have one complaint: I wish Taeyeon wasn't in this video. Now,  I really do respect her as an artist,  and she has an amazing voice, but it feels like the focus has been taken off Amber, when this is supposed to be HER single! It feels like SM is putting a hetero normative girl in the video just for the sake of it, as if saying that Amber isn't feminine enough or ready enough to be the focus of a music video.  I don't know, maybe I'm jumping the gun and making something out of nothing, but this is how I feel.",2,2015-02-25T01:52:45Z

My friend is interested in a few K-Pop artists such as Davichi or K.Will, and I showed her a f(x) video, but when I showed her this video, she told me that Amber was doing a horrible, awkward version of the ""Nay-Nay"" in this MV. Now I came up with two conclusions, Amber wasn't really trying to do the Nay-Nay, or she was trying to do a spin-off of it without actually copying it. Do you really think that she's just doing a really horrible version of the dance or what? What are your opinions?",1,2015-02-22T04:17:51Z

@ForgottenCharacter," The song from the getgo I thought was awesome--the video took me a few views to become more okay with.

It's more the film and editing rather than the actual footage itself---it just seemed choppy or off beat at times, which made it difficult. Like lips not syncing by a lot for a second, or a dance looking very lax or uncoordinated. It was always very brief seconds of awkward that could've been overlooked and forgotten, except they added up with one another to cause disjunction for me as a viewer.

However, the footage subject did seem to replicate some of YG's past MVs, but not with the same kickass flare. Because of course SM doesn't want to actually be YG or produce the same images at all. So the resulting style wasn't badass like YG's attempted portrayals, but it also wasn't purely usual SM's fun/vibrant style---which came off here a bit goofy and undefined because of it.

The more I watched, the easier it became to ignore. Mostly because the song is FREAKING FANTASTIC, and also because I've adored Amber since LAchATA~

My second favourite song from her solo album is ""I wanna"" featuring Eric Nam, which is fantastic. And while Amber isn't a powerhouse singer, when she's not rapping she has such a beautiful sweet quality to her voice that's just wonderful.

I hope she comes out with more solo albums. This one's fantastic",0,2015-02-17T18:22:31Z

HOWEVER, I wonder why African American style, culture, slang, and dance is so popular, but we have to deal with so much racism and stereotype. If I go to visit Korea as a Black man dressed Hip hop style, Im I going to be viewed as well as the way my culture is being mimicked and copied or am I going to be seen as some dangerous Black American...

Is Black culture mimicked because its is enjoyed and appreciated..
Do Korean People understand what Hip Hop and Black Culture is or is this all just entertainment...

The dance is Black American, The style is Black American, but can I get the same respect and esteem in Korea or in the Korean American community...",60,2015-02-17T16:13:36Z

@kardsh,"Wow I didn't expect to see a lot of negative comments about taeyeon's part , I thought I'd be the only one to find it unnecessary. 
It's definitely doesn't fit the song at all.
When the song reached its peak you'd expect yourself start jumping but instead.... It's this thing.....
Put off the mood... 

Plus it's was uncomfortable with her face randomly popping up for milliseconds......",37,2015-02-17T12:41:43Z
@LGKnowsMusic,"I'm a YG stan who is also an SM stan who is also a JYP stan who is also a TSENT stan... I love all KPOP industries. I personally love Amber and her solo debut album is amazing. I like Taeyeon and I want to say it was annoying how they sprinkled her presence throughout the MV and should've just been at the end. Yes that was annoying but she didn't ruin the song in any way. This ""hate"" needs to stop, it's been going on since she and Baekhyun started dating, guys remember idols are people too. Do you think your ""hate"" comments mean nothing? You can express your comment in a nicer way and not a hurtful way.Anyways, I'm in full support of my llamas solo. I want to see more albums of Amber come out in the future!!

To clear everyone mind, Amber is a GIRL and we don't know anything about her being lesbian (and it's none if our business). She's a rapper of f(x) and she's doing solo. Taeyeon who is featuring is not unnecessary, is not the main artist in this MV,she is just featuring in Amber's song!

@laura83ra,I come to this video for taeyeon. I bought the song on iTunes coz of taeyeon. I'm sure I'm not the only one who this. Amber her self wants taeyeon featuring her in this video. Do you haters still think taeyeon appearance is unnecessary?  Lol. Her voice gives a feminine touch to this song. It makes the song complete and balanced. So sad that there are people thinking that taeyeon is trying to steal attention instead of trying to help a friend. And she actually made it. Just consider how many taeyeon fans come here and support Amber debut. Not only by watching the video but buying the digital. I'm not Amber's fan but I support her coz I know Taeyeon loves and supports Amber all the way. Taeyeon just a kind person who pleasantly supporting a friend. Poor you who give her a shit for her kindness.,0,2015-02-17T05:28:34Z

@AppleRedLover,If you hate Taeyon then don't take it out on Amber's video. Choosing Taeyon to feature in her video was her decision and it made her happy. Now hating on Taeyon won't hold her from reaching the peak of success in her career. So if you hate or dislike her then just keep it to yourself or bring it somewhere else and not in Amber's video. ,0,2015-02-16T18:09:45Z

It just goes to show what a great friend, sunbae, and dongsaeng she is. Everyone loves her. This is why she's my favorite girl at SM these days. At first I liked the track, then I was concerned that the track didn't sound like it was going to have any singing, and then bam the bridge hit me! It's actually a really good song and I think it suits Amber really well. This album is probably one of the best things that SM has put out in a while!",1,2015-02-16T17:42:15Z

Before you go hating on me, hear me out.

Why Taeyeon got bashed from F(X) fans while their idol is in the same agency?

The fans should work together to increase the viewers.Maybe, If there is no Taeyeon, maybe this Vid wouldn't have reached 2M viewers in only a few days. So, rather than hating for each other, let's support each other.

@verkyu,"Personally, I think Taeyeon has a wonderful voice, she can hit high notes and executes them perfectly. But I don't think she or anyone should be in Amber's song/mv. It's a SOLO debut, meaning one person. We've waiting long for Amber's debut, and we all know f(x) is treated poorly (they haven't had a world tour yet, and they don't have an official fan name). I'm pretty sure that Amber could possibly hit that high note and do the ad libs, she can sing as well as rap.

I don't think SM understand what 'solo' means. This has happened before with other artists. Jonghyun had someone featuring in his title song, so did Zhou Mi, Henry and maybe even Kyuhyun (if you count Irene's appearance, which added nothing to the music video).

Of course, if it was Amber's choice to have Taeyeon in the song/mv, then that's fine, but SM needs to have more faith that artists will do well without having someone more popular feature.

@bradyliske9289,"Everyone has opinions. Whether it be about the music itself, or the artist, or other things entirely. Comments on here do actually get read a lot of the time by the artists themselves so you might want to watch what you say or how you say things on here (if you at least have a bit of humanity or emotion or care how others interpret your comment). If you are to say something, at least sound somewhat professional  and respectful. Just know that just because you may not believe or agree what one some person may be saying, it doesn't mean that others or yourself need to reply and start an argument that gets you nowhere, rather just making people irritated or angry instead. (My opinion) Amber eonnie your rapping is creative and smooth (I love that you used your nickname Llama in your lyrics) and your voice is just angelic. Your entire mini album Beautiful is all around amazing and I am so happy that it is constantly on replay.

This song is really good (except Taeyeon's parts because she's just annoying and she doesn't bring anything to the song), it's really catchy and there is other compagnies' peoples!! When I saw JoonHyun, I thought that maybe it was because he is in G.O.D and he is part of the legend, but then I was Jackson and everyone.. I was so shocked but sooooooooo happy~! >//<
This is amazing and sooooo good~~~~! I really love it! SM Ent., this is one of the rare times when I'm proud of you!

Don't get me wrong, Amber can rap, but I'd love to see her vocals too. Taeyeon looked gorgeous and she did amazing, but I really wish this music video was just Amber.

@ThaoLe-mn3qk,"I think SM plays a trick here. 
Fans argue that there are too many articles or comments about Taeyeon - not a main singer or composer in this MV, whereas Amber is assumed to be the secondary one here.
But to tell the true, Amber or SM can use another vocal singer for Amber to shine. Hence, there wont be much views as if Taeyeon is in. And then, Taeyeon is a key to attract but in stage, a less popular singer will replace so that Amber can shine and Taeyeon wont waste her time.",1,2015-02-15T16:43:24Z

It's Amber's music video, I know. But let me have a talk with the ones talking about Taeyeon.

First, stop bitching about her omg. I know I might not going to change your opinion about her after what I'm going to say but GOD stop being rude.

 Taeyeon didn't force herself to be in here. She was contacted by Amber to be in her mv because they're good friends. And people, why are you hating on  here. Taeyeon? Just because she's famous, you're going to find a reason to hate on her? AND she isn't overrated. Overrated means getting too much attention when you don't have that much talent. But bro, Taeyeon is one of the best singers in K-Pop and she has a great personality. Why else are you hating on Taeyeon? OH because of her relationship with Baekhyun? Damn, that's another lame reason. And severely irrelevabt. Baekhyun has nothing to do here wtf. I'm also an EXO-L and I love Baekhyun so much and I'm not hating Taeyeon for the dating thing between them. I actually ship them before their ship name's invented. And what else? Are you haters seriously going to insert plastic surgery here? Omg so what if she had ps? I got into SNSD's fandom because of what? THEIR TALENT. Idc about the face bro. That's just a small factor that makes me love SNSD only a bit more. Other than that, I like Taeyeon very much along with Amber.

Haters, can you tell me what's wrong with her that isn't MADE UP? Like really I'm not going to be selfish here, I want to hear your side.

Love Amber but not like Taeyeon? It's okay, but hate Taeyeon and bash? Ugh no.",458,2015-02-15T14:02:53Z

If Amber wanted her there, then I'll eat my words, but I find Taeyeon quipping in a ""yeah, uh huh"" every other ten seconds is annoying. Amber is a bombtastic singing voice too, so she could have sang her own part. But idk, just food for thought. ",0,2015-02-15T07:18:47Z

Primero fue Jonghyun de SHINee, para mí el sí da la talla como solista puesto que tiene buena calidad vocal, luego Taemin, no estaba tan convencida acerca de él pero todas saben que baila genial y lo esta haciendo bien, pero amber, su canción para nada me gusta. Mejor hubieran hecho debutar a LUNA, sería lo más justo, la verdad no sé que tiene la SM en la cabeza, primero dejan que se vaya Kriss, Jessica, Luhan, Y AHORA QUIEREN HACER DEBUTAR A TODOS, ya pzzzz.",3,2015-02-15T03:51:54Z

@meech5407,"You guys are really gonna hate on Taeyeon? 'She's on screen to much' 'She ruined the MV for me!' Yeah she's on screen to much totally people because for like 3:00 whole minutes all I saw was Taeyeon and her awesome rapping skills and I saw Amber on screen for like 10 seconds with her high note. And Taeyeon was asked to be featured by Amber. And why do we have to hate? She was only on screen for 10 seconds and for you people who keep saying she has to many lines all she has is 'shake that brass' , 'ohh', and 'yeah' so stop hating and just enjoy the damn song!

All she has now is hate from F(x) fans, they're rival 2NE1 (fans) and mainly EXO stans.
"" *Doesn't deserve to be in this MV* "" - Giving up 3/4 a day in a week for a small part in a MV or even more. Do you know how much it takes to give in an MV even though you have very small part. Make-up ✓ Filming ✓ Recording ✓ . _They have enough talent to show so why dull it?_ Plus I think F(x) fans should be greatful for her since they would not have this many views if it wasn't for the people in the MV and her.

I get that them trying to play the instruments is a joke but it is still extremely cringe-worthy for someone WHO ACTUALLY PLAYS A BRASS INTRUMENT to see a couple musical artists incorrectly holding/trying to play legit musical instruments. There are a lot of other artists that have done this (Big Bang, Block B, Junhyung, etc) thinking that it makes them look 'cool' and 'sexy' when, in the eyes of people who actually know a great deal about music and musical instruments, they just look ignorant and ridiculous. No hate on Amber or any other idols though. I love her and this song. Especially the French horn synth in the first chorus! >u<",111,2015-02-14T22:34:55Z

@Silviegold,"I don't see why so many haters just hate on Taeyeon. Amber PERSONALLY asked for her to come. And of course, Amber's deep alto voice needed a soprano to compliment the song (which is Taeyeon). What has Taeyeon do to you? I don't get why y'all have to hate on her for being herself. I think she's more smiley and having more fun in this music video than the other MVs she's done with SNSD in the past few years. Taeyeon has a beautiful voice and so does Amber. I was reluctant to try Amber's new song because I heard fans say it'll be just mediocre song. But boy they were so wrong, the song is amazing, it's my jam! I understand you have your opinions and all, but no one asked for any haters on Taeyeon or on Amber for letting Taeyeon be featured. I don't see any real fans complaining about how many JYP artists that are cameoing in the MV, so don't complain about Taeyeon. Be mature and if you don't like Taeyeon or the song, we're not asking you like to it or watch it. (: ",0,2015-02-14T18:52:50Z

Everyone always thinks it is SM that is behind all of this, but guess what? It is not! Amber asked her to feature in it! Also people that are complaining about Taeyeon being in the music video, she barely sings in it. She only has a few lines and you mostly see her at the end.

@KissMissQUEenn,"I'm a fan of both Girls' Generation and f(x), therefore I'm staying neutral and expressing my own views, without biasing or hating on anybody. First, this has disappointed me a bit. (Btw, another one one this album, ""Beautiful"" is real fabulous! i like it!) I think in terms of the rhythm, this is neither catchy nor hilarious, I expect more than that from Amber. Amber is a great singer (I do think she's even better than Krystal) and rapper (no offence she's really good and has her own style) yet she doesn't fully show it off here,especially singing, is it? And the song is quite dull, seriously. Second, Taeyeon is good, but I think her voice doesn't suit the song. Why didn't Amber choose Luna instead? I hope it isn't due to the popularity thing. Anyway, Taeyeon's voice is sentimental and perfect for ballad songs. So this one is truly not for her. I think voices like f(Luna)'s or GG's Tiffany's or RV's Wendy's, which are more powerful will do and meet the song's requirement.",0,2015-02-14T17:26:21Z

@damnthatmashlookstasty,"Wow wtf. Why the fuck is Taeyeon in this. Ruined my day. Where the fuck are f(x)'s cameos. Why doesn't Amber get to showcase her vocals. I swear SM does this shit to create fanwars so they can get more views and comments. I'm sorry but this makes me angry. At least Aron and Rome made me feel better. I wish Eric Nam, Ailee, Peniel and Henry were here too! Too bad Kris filed a lawsuit. ",104,2015-02-14T11:31:56Z
@ItsMeRhaine,"Sometimes I really do hate the KPop fandom, everyone is so toxic, hateful, and immature at least 75% of the time, and I'm being really generous about that number. For once and for all can everyone just get along? Is that really too much to ask? It's like why do I even scroll down to the comments...
I'm not a huge fan of f(x), but I LOVE Amber and I know she worked her ass off for this song and mv as well as the entire album. This is AMBER'S MOMENT not Taeyeon... I am not here to hate on Taeyeon because I love her and SNSD (side note: I'm still butthurt over my girl Jessica gone...)
In all honestly I personally do not care about who got featured in whoever's video because at the end of the day what it really boils down to (imo) is if you simply just liked the song. Did you enjoy the song?
Ya'll being butthurt over Taeyeon and Wendy is overshadowing Amber's spotlight. Please do not steal her thunder, that she's worked so hard to get. Okay, I cannot stress enough that this is AMBER'S SOLO DEBUT and Taeyeon will get her chance in due time, which is apparently soon. Also for anyone wanting to know some trivia Amber was once way back in the day a huge fangirl for Taeyeon (and probably still is for all we know...?) and if Amber wanted Taeyeon to feature then cool beans.

Everyone just calm your tits because it's really all quite embarrassing, but hey what can I say that's the internet for ya... *major sigh* :/

Taeyeon only featuring some like ""uh-huh"" or ""won't you shake that brass"" and a high notes. But what makes you all bash her? Because of her dating baekhyun? If they love each other, why? Won't you all be upset if your relationship with someone is hated? Please, idols are human too, we should give them personal space.

Also its not Taeyeon who stole the spotlight. This is still Amber show. We enjoy amber as much as we enjoy Taeyeon and others. Please no hating. 

I think SM is proritizing Taeyeon because few years from now and Taeyeon'd contract as well as GG will expired. So the company should do something so that their artist will remain.  If they lost Taeyeon, they will also lost GG, TTS and some Sones. For sure, GG will never be the same just like what happens to Sica. If they lost Taeyeon it will surely be a big lost to SM.",1,2015-02-14T05:31:32Z

@maimer1691,"I don't think some people seem to grasp the fact that Amber really wanted Taeyeon in her MV. It was her decision. It goes the same for pretty much every other idol in the MV. They are her friends, and it's not up to us, the fans, to decide who can or cannot sing with her, or who can or cannot take part in her career. If you guys were real fans, you would be here to enjoy Amber's MV and celebrate her success, not come to criticize the appearance of another idol. ",2,2015-02-14T05:17:05Z

I haven't been watching the teasers for this video, but I didn't even know that Taeyeon was going to duet with Amber.

The way she says ""shake that brass"", it just sounds wrong to me...

Well anyways, Amber did an awesome job, I really do like this song, I'm glad she had a chance to do her own solo thing. I'm actually kinda surprised most of the rap lyrics are in korean, I thought it would've been at least 50/50, english and korean.

It brings a nice balance to the mini-album which overall has a lot of variety and a mature sound. Our llama has indeed grown up to be a fine woman. I'm glad SM gave her this opportunity to shine and work with someone she admires as well as her friends. As a f(x) fan, there was a lot of anticipation and worry surrounding this mini-album, but I'm relieved to say it turned out great.

@insanelysane8515,"LOL wow just read theough so many comments oh boy 

1) Id like to start out with just a congratulations  to the Ber Ber for finally getting a solo debut and making her music. Honestly thats what us fans should most be focused on. If the llamas happy im happy. 

2) can we stop with the sm stan yg stan conflict lol. I know so many people who like artists from both companies. Honestly y'all  are so problematic. 

3) im not an snsd fan tbh but i can appreciate  that yaeyeon has a suitable voice for the song and that she didnt over power amber. I mean gurl literally did nothing but sot there and do the random vocal noises in the back for most of the song... if you think she outshun amber with just that then you really need to appreciate Amber and her ability to shine more. 

4) the other artists are her friends. Min is like a sister and jackson like a little brother. The english speaking crew is her family in korea. If she wants em in the video then thats what the girl wants. If it was really a roomate promotion then you would have seen sunny (sm's link to roommate) in the mv. And correct me if im wrong but i didnt see her. 

5) yo guys... just chill... the llama is watching and she's too chill a person to have such unsatisfied and problematic fans. Just support HER you dont need to bash other people to do it. Buy her album promote her and show SM that amver shines on her own and F(x) shines too. Complaining wont solve anything, but actions do. ",0,2015-02-13T22:18:25Z

@tyramcneil1345,"Omg really, people? Taeyeon was obviously featured in order to increase views and interest. EVERYONE and they mama know that SNSD is THE most popular girl group (let's not get into debate over their quality, whether they deserve it, if ___ group has more fans -- let's face it and be honest, it's SNSD). Who, disclaimer -- I am relatively neutral towards (Here because Amber's cute yo). Being honest, if I were Amber, I would ask Taeyeon to feature too! It's a smart move -- business wise. And as much as K-pop fans hate to admit it, MUSIC IS A BUSINESS. PERFORMANCE, ENTERTAINING, FAME IS ALL A BUSINESS filled with business decisions. And as far as attention goes, Taeyeon was a great move! So many fans watch this JUST FOR TAEYEON. This is neither a good thing (because in that case how much substance will trickle down to sales? How many Taeyeon fans will feel compelled to then purchase this song or album? Because that will matter more than views) or bad (because it it still garnering attention for Amber even if not all or many Taeyeon fans spend money on this production). But this says nothing for the actual quality of the song/video (which is sadly going to promoted much more than Beautiful because of the attention Taeyeon (and the other stars) will bring. So I don't get why people are 1. Mad at Taeyeon??? (Like... why?) 2. Here just for Taeyeon and trying to pass it off like they love Amber and the song too?? Like then buy the album otherwise, you lyin' and SM don't really care about your half assed opinion. /endrant",45,2015-02-13T21:10:03Z

@camillybuckerman7227,"I see many people just giving attention to Taeyon, and when someone says the video is Amber, are beginning to think they are jealous of Tae. People, I am exo-l, and despite not shippar Baekyeon, I respect them. Taeyon is my bias in SNSD, and I think very talented. In this mv, she was super well, but we must not forget the true essence of it here: AMBER. Amber was wonderful as always ... I met the group f (x) recently, but I can say that it is a strong candidate to be my bias in this group. It is going very well in the ground, I had expected this, her performance is always very good. I like the way her excited and how it is different compared to the other girls. I just have a question I see a lot of people commenting, but not sure if it's true ... Amber is a lesbian? or Bi? or she is straight, but just likes to dress like that, without being too feminine? Well, that's just a curiosity of mine, because this will not change anything for me, it remains my most recent bias, and no matter their sexuality, after all I do not have any prejudice! Anyone who has knowledge about it (if it was ever said anything), please answer me whether it is or not. Just tell if it's true, I'm tired of rumors, it just confuses me more.

@tuskernene01,"I'm guessing people are complaining without realizing what ""featuring"" really means, featuring basically mean that person is a guest on the track, you can't say featuring and have the person on for 2 seconds think about it would you invite someone somewhere and kick them out as soon as they walk in? No! and Amber has more lyrics in the song, people don't realize Amber has a say so in the song because its hers, if she didn't want Taeyon to be featured in the song she wouldn't be in it, so since they are performing together its because Amber wanted it.

I get the feeling a lot of the haters are fans of Baekyun or people who are jealous, Amber is friends with so many people so if you think people who can only contact them through social websites will affect their decisions on music making...think again the negative opinions NEVER mater because you negative people aren't God's or the big boss or anything to them, just negative people.",1,2015-02-13T20:16:34Z

@hokeypokeykid,"Okay, usually I don't leave comments, but I feel like this is absolutely necessary. I am disgusted with the comments I am seeing on this video.

This is Amber's debut song, and you people who claim to be her fans want to shit on one of her good friends in the comment section? Seriously? She put a lot of effort into this song, and into including her closest friends in the video. Do you think she would be happy to see things such as, ""Fuck Taeyeon,"" and ""Taeyeon is so fake?"" This is a song that showcases Amber's skills, and by placing your attention on the fact that Taeyeon is in the video and how much she ""sucks"" and ""needs to go die,"" you are really making yourself look like a fool, and devaluing the time and effort spent to make a music video that YOU the fan are supposed to like.

Even though I'm only a casual fan of both Amber and Taeyeon, I'm just really hurt for the both of them, knowing that there are people who will come on a music video just to spread their ridiculous negativity. They are human beings too, and just as you wouldn't want to hear people telling you to ""fuck off and die,"" they don't want to hear it either.

Congrats to Amber and Taeyeon for all of their hard work on this song. It's really catchy and I hope that the rest of Amber's solo career won't be marred by the disgusting hate that is present in this comment section. ",153,2015-02-13T19:23:32Z

@usamamuhammad2356,"Let's be honest, all the Taeyeon haters out there. If you ever saw her on the street you'd ask her for an autograph or photo and say something like ""I'm such a big fan"" when really you're not. Stop acting so fake by hating on Taeyeon as if she's done something wrong to you directly. Although I disliked when Taeyeon said Alicia Keys is ""Pretty for a black girl"", but that doesn't mean I hate her. Hate on the action not her. Everyone makes mistakes from time to time; just drop it.

@changjopark428,"I think it's quite inane of anyone to say Taeyeon's featuring is unnecessary. It's funny because most people complaining have problem with who sang the part, not the part itself. Push all the hate aside, listen to the music, and you'll realize the part's value. On the other hand, some people are complaining about the brevity of Taeyeon's part. Come on, suck it up. She's only featuring, my goodness. It was a good balance.",1,2015-02-13T18:56:58Z

This was a great title song for Amber's solo debut and if you listen to her whole album it really showcases Amber's voice in many different ways from her usual so people stop complaining about either Amber not singing, Taeyeon singing in this ONE song and just enjoy the MV and album, especially the english remake of F(x)'s Goodbye Summer called Just Wanna ft.

@VRaspberry,"As much as I love Amber, I feel that SM could have definitely done better for her solo debut. Also to have Amber herself sing instead of only rapping. Amber has a good voice, and if they could have her sing more, then I think her solo could go further. We all know she can rap. But if someone is to do a solo debut, then the artist should show more of her ""hidden"" talents than show us what we already know she can do…",0,2015-02-13T17:16:13Z

@LadySunghee,"One funny thing I noticed about this song is that it sounds like a typical KPOP song in reverse. I mean, in a typical KPOP song, vocalists will take up like 3 minutes and 30 seconds of a song while rappers need to squeeze in everything they (2-3 members) have to say in like 45 seconds. The rest of the song, if it's funky upbeat, they'll be shouting adlibs like ""wooh"" or ""yeah"", The reason why this is reverse is finally, there's a rap-song which features a vocalist and keeps the vocalist a feature. Because I have heard enough upbeat-funky-rap songs with half the main rapper and half the ""featuring"" artist.

I'm NOT saying that I didn't like the Taeyeon touch though.",1,2015-02-13T16:39:58Z

Myself on the other hand LOVED this music video, its catchy and taeyeon was the cherry on top of it.

@nimphea,"I'm very SNSD biased (I support each and everyone of the 8 members+Jessica) but I do think Taeyeon was overpowering Amber. Taeyeon was just basically singing some parts that Amber was saying as well and had a small line. But it's just my thoughts and I don't really care about it since it was Amber's own request for featuring Taeyeon in the song and for me, it still went really great though. Also, I almost threw my laptop out of excitement when I saw Irene, Joonhyung, Jackson, Min, Jia, Hyoyeon and the others in the same setting. However I'm a little upset that Ailee isn't in the MV since Amber and Ailee are very good friends, right? But still, Like can you believe it?

""Came here only for Taeyeon"" ""This song sucks but my Taeyeon is in it!""
Ugh,why do i have to deal with it...
Dear Taeyeon fans,I'm glad you're here because of Taeyeon. But those comments,are they really necessary? This is Amber solo (If I wasnt clear enough,look at the title),so how about you write something like ""Oh hey,I'm here for Taeyeon,but this song is really cool! I support Amber!"" SONEs,saying you came only for Taeyeon make you look bad and start unecessary fanwars. It's like Zhoumi's  Rewind Part 2,only this time you're replacing EXO-Ls.
Also,didn't like the song? Good for you. MOVE ON.
I don't know what did you guys expect. A super deep and meaningful song? Showcase of her singing abilities? (Go listen to the mini-album if you want those.) This is a fun and catchy song,and I didn't expect anything else.
So please,if you have nothing else to do then to hate on Amber or Taeyeon,go try bunjee-jumping or something. I hope the rope breaks.",5,2015-02-13T13:44:47Z

Probably for publicity, but tbh anyone else in SNSD would've been just as great, ngl. (But since it's Amber's choice, just go with it). I would've rather seen Tiffany bc in my opinion Taeyeon's voice is sort of nasally, but meh, each to their own. And no, for all of you that are about to bitch me out, I am not jealous or dumb just because I don't like your 'Taengoo'. Amber could've really shined in this, and with Taeyeon's presence, I don't think she did. Beautiful is still my fav song. ",2,2015-02-13T12:40:41Z

Dear SM haters, not only SM asks their aritsts to feature in others' songs. Look at YG, GD helps Taeyang whenever Taeyang comeback and vice versa, Snoop Dogg featuring in Psy's song, HuynA in GangNam Style... You' guys so stupid and naive when saying that SM's the cruel one. 
Kpop fans made it a big deal about featuring. Come on noone steals your idols' spotlight, it makes the songs better. ",1,2015-02-13T11:23:02Z

Um, Amber is awesome with a great personality (which it seems like this video is like Instead of talent look at how many friends Amber has and look how cute and charming she is!) which is all when and good, but does nothing for the quality of this song that just so happened to get a pretty cute video?? Like could've been better, just someone at SM was being hella lazy and something was put out too haphazard. And let's all be honest with ourselves Taeyeon was asked to be a part of this because we all know Amber isn't popular enough (as an artist, not MC/TV personality --- as a rapper, musician, musical performer) to get the amount of attention that adding in Taeyeon would get.

amber and taeyeon are friends and both great artists from sm.
why isn't it totally okay for everybody that tae was featured in this song and mv? artists help each other and love to make a collab together, it inspires you and there's lot of creativity in it.

amber loves taeyeon as artist, she calls her ""dope"" and she asked her to participate in her own song. it was ambers own choice and nobody else decided it.

really now; just enjoy the music and support them if you like it.

If taeyeon is there or not is not no. 1 topic here.. the song is much more important. SM FINALLY FINALLY release a funky song with great mv that suits amber and instead rejoicing, you guys chose to argue over a little thing tho. Taeyeon is there to spice up the mv, like others featuring, yes she is not necessary there, but would it hurts if she's there anyway? Silly fans.",0,2015-02-13T08:47:07Z

@adahyun6635,"Omg what's wrong with you people. The MV and song are both perfect! I think you are just hating because it's SM Entertainment and that Taeyeon is part of the MV.. First of all, SM made a creative and fun MV this time so shouldn't you be thankful for that? New style, new trend. Secondly, Taeyeon definitely did not ruin the song. It's always better if there is a soothing voice between Rapping parts to add more style to it. 

Anyway, I LOVE THIS VERY MUCH. Amber is amazinggggg, taetae is amazing...the song is amazing (already listened to it like 20 times). And the MV is daebbbaaak. Way to go SM! 

Haters will forever be haters. If something is terrible, they will hate. If something is good, they still continue to hate. Oh well..they're haters. ",0,2015-02-13T07:30:31Z

This is a prove for anyone who told that SM's rapper is not good enough, Amber shows how cool her rap in this MV and it's not like Taeyeon appearance is unnecessary, she made a good highnote. The real unnecessary one is hating on someone without logic reason. Plus, this MV shows how good SMxJYP relationship is. Go Amber!! Go Taeyeon!! Go f(x)!! Go GG!!

""SHIT. THIS IS SO DAMN COOL!"" 

I think the perfect collab from Amber and Taeyeon. Well, both of them are my biases at F(x) and SNSD. So far its very entertaining. It makes me wanna dance, rock my body feeling the rhytm, that bass xD I love Amber's style. Always!!! She shows us about no need to be girlie sexy cutie or what. She is always look so fine wohooooo~ harmony between Taeyeon's high pitch and Amber's rapp just AWSOMAZING. And all artists... OMG THERE IS JACKSON FROM GOT7 AYAYAYYAYAY...

But, idk am i the one and only who miss every single thing about Luhan and Kris also Jess every I see SM's newest info. Just wish that they'll back again. I want they back again really. And I want EXO comeback with OT12 , SNSD with OT9. I missed SM's old formation so much. Amber's solo debut seems like to forget those ex member of SM. But I love them.

@ichigoiruka18,"I love Amber and I love this song! It's a lot of fun to listen to. (And I love that she put ""llama"" in it XD)
And I also believe that Taeyon's vocals were well mixed into the song and definitely added something. HOWEVER, that being said, I also feel that, by giving Taeyeon the ending note, it kind of upstages Amber a bit at the end as the final focus will be on Taeyeon instead of Amber.  But on the whole I enjoyed the interplay of rap and singing and liked that, instead of the usual mix of mostly singing and 1 rap bit, it was reversed so that it's mostly rapping with a singing bit (if that makes sense).
On the whole, I enjoy listening to this song and only hope that Amber has more vocal/singing lines in the future since she does have a nice singing voice :) Amber fighting!

Amber is loved by everyone! And this song is bumpin'! But, having someone sing will open doors for live stage collabs which I'm looking forward to! Hope this get a lot of love Amber!

Taeyeon's part gave this song a fun twist to it, in my opinion, this song would just be ""okay ish good"" without Taeyeon's part but her part made it GREAT and FUN.

@reyanime,"Sadly, I didn't like the song till Taeyeon's part. Sure the beat was catchy but I actually found the song to be boring. I also prefer Amber's singing voice over her rapping so that was a let down too. I love f(x) and I'm a Sone but this song is better with Taeyeon in it. I understand it didn't really fit with the rest of the song but despite that it would of been better if the entire song had been sung with may be a small rap part. That's just my take on it.",0,2015-02-13T03:56:49Z

@junetan5047,"Okay can people stop hating on Taeyeon. Read this article: http://www.allkpop.com/article/2015/02/amber-explains-how-she-got-taeyeon-to-feature-in-shake-that-brass 

Amber ASKED Taeyeon to be in this, so she must have thought that Taeyeon's vocals can complement this song well. Now whether Taeyeon's vocals actuall sound nice or not its for you guys to decide, but please stop blaming Taeyeon or GG for butting into things because they are not. 

As for view counts, I am a SONE and have to admit that if not for Taeyeon I would not have checked this out. Given Taeyeon and GG's popularity, I would say that their involvement would no doubt help Amber, but I know that Amber is also highly popular so she can also uphold popularity on her own account. 

In all, you guys can criticise this song/vocals all you like because you are entitled to your own opinions, but stop blaming innocent people before actually getting to know the truth and your own baseless prejudices. ",2,2015-02-13T03:49:00Z

@procrastinator555,"Wow this song exceeds my expectations. The taeyeon featuring was just enough to bring more ppl to listen and watch this vid i feel-- I was really afraid the featuring would overpower the point of AMBER SOLO But it hasn't and the taeyeon vocal parts actually really accentuate and upgrade the sound of the song (I dunno if the yeah and uh-huhs are really necessary but at least the singing parts I feel really do add a little more funk to this song). 

And I mean this is the BEST way possible - Taeyeon is amber's video ho? HAHA it's actually awesome, because it gives taeyeon a little more street cred/edge. As SNSD leader, she's known as such a straight-edge... I like that she did this fun little feature. I feel like it shows that she doesn't take herself too seriously, and she's willing to do fun little projects like this which will help her hoobaes. ",0,2015-02-13T03:09:33Z

@chelseacorpuz98,"I honestly don’t understand how some people think Taeyeon “stole the spotlight” or whatever? Like, okay, I get it. You’re butthurt because she’s dating/dated Baekhyun, or maybe because she’s the leader of SNSD and was supposed to keep Jessica from leaving the group, etc, etc. But this is AMBER’S VIDEO. I mean, if you’re having trouble READING THE DESCRIPTION AND THE TITLE AND BY LOOKING AT HOW LITTLE THERE IS OF TAEYEON AND HOW AMBER’S IN THE VIDEO 99.5% OF THE TIME, then…. I think you need help or something? Maybe a tutor…? Because it’s not that hard to comprehend how Taeyeon’s just a featured artist.. (though Taeng did a great job at adlibbing and she looked amazing, but that’s not my point).

POINT IS, please stop all these rude comments directed to Taeyeon? It’s a really fun video and Amber's a good person, so we should all be here to support Amber, and not bring other artists down.

Third - I feel like this MV is proof of how much love idols/celebs have for Amber - so many cameos (Jackson! <3). Amazing song, the choreo looked so swag, I can't wait to see it live!

There's no parts that really stand out or make it really catchy, which is upsetting, cuz I know Amber's super talented.

Why is it when sm makes a solo debut, all of u complained about this featuring thing?? Why dont u say anything when other company idols do this featuring thing?? Biased much, huh? Be grateful that these idols are given solo debut for them to shine even more. I think featuring is showing some love and support to the soloist. And in this case, it's like showing some SM family love. Is it that wrong? Why is it okay for YG JYP CUBE to do so, but not for SM? Grow up guys...",1,2015-02-13T01:52:42Z

I mean, in my opinion, i think Amber pretty much caught everyone's attention from the  beginning of the video without the help of anyone else. SM tends to do this when making a solo song for their artists. They always have to include someone more popular from the company to ensure it catches attention but in this case Amber did not need anyone else. Full rapping with no singing part would have been perfectly fine. 

On another note great song! I thought it would be another one of sm's meh songs but I actually really liked it, especially the cool dancing, which is something we don't really see from sm female artists.",1,2015-02-13T01:29:47Z

It disappointed me that she didn't sing much in Fx's songs but her rapping made up for it :) I think she deserved this, to get the spotlight and show off all her talents. I cherished every moment with seeing Amber and Fx on stage performing their hearts out. And it broke my heart when promotions for Red Light were stopped. Though this is one of the best things to happen, Amber getting her debut. No matter what happens I will always be a Fx fan and an Amber fan (llama).

@boydrewl,"To be honest they could've taken this song on a whole other level. I love the fact that they added trumpets and so many cool raw instruments definitely one of the coolest solos. I felt like Taeyeon's note could've been longer. Her small high pitched notes in the end sorta drifted from the song.. it's like it shouldn't have been placed there. It reminded me of the notes in Twinkle. They were not structured to be placed their. She is an amazing vocalist. Maybe even one of the best in K-pop but SM needs to work on mixing the synths and rhythms with the vocals. I'm not saying their not good at it , but I think they need to work on it. It could totally make the music way more suitable for the ears. Amber did amazing but couldn't they add singing parts..? I think everyone (mostly) wanted it. (I mean I did) but anyways I really liked it otherwise. 황색 그런데 항상 랩과 훌륭한 일을 했어! #Amber #Fighting! ",0,2015-02-13T00:28:48Z

HOO BETTER GET THAT BRASS READY
HERE WE GO HEY SHAKE THAT BRASS

Stop, come here and let’s replace everything
You and me, let’s change up this scene
This rhythm is a prepared frying pan bass and treble, heat up your body
Add and multiply your fun, everyone together
Don’t be shy and just shake it, get on the floor, shake that brass

A cool llama, if you don’t know me, drama
I get down down baby, from now on, I’m a rock star
What’re you doing alone? Just wait, don’t be nervous and blow that horn

It’s very easy, just follow me and dance
Throw away your calm image and do it with me, shake that brass

HEY HO (YEAH) HEY HO (UH HUH) HEY HO SHAKE THAT BRASS X2

NA NA NA NA NA NA – SHAKE THAT BRASS X2
SHAKE THAT BRASS

Unni, attention please, even if you know how to party, follow me
I’m a piper girl, if you look behind me, everyone’s all lined up

LIKE DADUM DEEDUM DUM DUM DUM X3
JUST LET IT ALL GO AND SHAKE THAT BRASS

Good job, you do know how to party
Raise the tension a bit more, it’s ready, shake that brass

LET’S DROP IT ONE MORE TIME

I WANT YOU TO (SHAKE SHAKE THAT BRASS) I WANT YOU TO
YEAH I WANT YOU TO (SHAKE SHAKE THAT BRASS)
YEAH I WANT YOU TO SHAKE THAT BRASS

All the worries of tonight, do it tomorrow, the day after tomorrow
Empty your head, so you can’t think of anything
Put your hands up, jump up and down
Everyone go crazy, get it started
COME AND SHAKE THAT BRASS- YEAH

@ChristopherD2012,"EXO L's are so immature since Taeyeon ""took"" away Baekyun from all the young girls' hearts and it created a domino effect so now, everyone looks down up-on every decision or thing that she does. She is human at the end of they day, I don't know why so many people are attacking her, I'm sure you wouldn't like it if people attacked you with hurtful comments. If you hate her, take those comments elsewhere or just go watch your own bias and leave her alone. If your bias is EXO, think about the type of image you're creating for them. At the end of the day, Baekhyun probably texts Taeyeon goodnight and everything and then puts on a different image for the stans and then comes home to Taeyeon, someone he loves and protects her from all the hateful comments. 

TLDR: Stop the hate. Enjoy Taeyeon and Amber in this song. If you have any hate, get off the internet before all the fans eat you alive.

I don't know why people are being haters about Taeyeon being in this debut, in case you didn't know, Jonghyun, Henry, even Taemin all solo debuted with other SM artist's as their back-up...

She's obviously likes the song, and she WANTED Taeyeon to do the song with her. Amber seems to be having fun, and Taeyeon too. We should be supporting them, and the song. You all complain how Amber never gets to shine, but she is shining so bright right now. I mean she looks great, she's having fun, and personally I love her rapping and singing. I actually love the song and the beat. So can we all just not argue and complain so much? Can't we all just be happy with her and congratulate her on her solo debut? ",0,2015-02-12T23:06:48Z

This song is catchy & you can tell it's amber's style but it's not something i would listen to over & over (okay i lied i like it). But I love amber & will still support her! Also i wish that people would stop bickering over taeyeon being in this song. I'm not a fan of her but i think she doesn't ruin the song. What is done is done; It was amber's choice to have taeyeon feature in her song. Amber is just making her own masterpiece of an album & who are we to say who shouldn't be in it etc. We're not professional people in the music industry who has the right to say what's bad & good, we're just an audience. For once can we just comment about something positive. I remember the days kpop comments were mostly rainbows & sunshine lol",0,2015-02-12T23:03:35Z

It doesn't really matter who because they're working as a team. Those that are posting hate comments, why don't you just leave in silence and go back to the music that you think is good? The world would be much more peaceful without people like you who sits there and criticize people who are hardworking.

I think amber needs more recognition than she gets. She's very talented; she can rap, dance, and I heard her sing before..it's not terrible. Im not hating on taeyeon but I think this video kind of focused on her a lot. and her parts kind of stood out more? idunno like the brightness, her scenes were more flashy and that seemed like it was Taeyeon featuring Amber...this is just my opinion.

@rie4449,"-Everyone is commenting about their opinions and shiet and Taeyeon and stuff. Yes, she was featured, and yeah, it was ""cool"" she was featured, but this is AMBER'S song. This is all about Amber. This is her solo album! 
We should all just be happy for her. Who the hell cares about anything else. Who cares if you didn't like it. Boo hoo for you. I get it, but let's just show Amber our support and love for her. All this other stuff is just nonsense.-
*MV was awesome!  It was really funny, and I like how Amber's closest friends were in the MV. Amber's rapping is the best, as always, and dance moves were so swag (?) Lol. Congrats on Amber's solo debut! I love you 언니~~~ And the lyrics are pretty cool too, you should check them out. XD

Without TY, the song honestly would've been too repetitive and basic... Theres seriously a whole bunch of songs like this. TY's part actually saved the song for me and to the ones that claims Amber should get more spotlight, think about it this way she kinda is LOL bc TY's haters are contributing with their views and hate comments, and if you're one too thank you for helping Amber! (; Btw TY's voice sounds hella good with Amber so what's the problem? Oh wait, I forgot the delulu fans who want the bacon. Smh petty fangirls. BTW YOU CAN EASILY COMPLIMENT AMBER WITHOUT HATING ON TAEYEON. I would compliment Amber more but she already as a lot of support in the comments so I just want to give a little love to Taeyeon with mine <3 ",0,2015-02-12T22:38:09Z

@extraleague01,"I love this song and the MV! It's pure fun and goodness! TBH, it's been quite sometime since I really liked a new Kpop song. I also like this probably cuz I like fast beat rap songs, as I find most slow beat rap songs quite boring. Love all the appearances by Amber's friends. There were pleasant surprises like Busker Busler's Brad, GOD's Joonhyung, comedienne Ahn Youngmi, Miss A's Min and Jia. This is really an Amber song that I wanted to listen to, spiced up by Taeyeon's beautiful voice towards the end. FYI, Amber asked Taeyeon to sing in her song.

BTW, I assume that 95% of people who don't likely Taeyeon's appearance here are either Taeyeon haters or SNSD haters, most likely NOT Amber fans, since most of these people don't even mention Amber (LOL) when talking about how Taeyeon appears a lot, which isn't true at all. Taeyeon's singing part only comes out towards the end and her total appearance is maximum 45 seconds out of the 3min38s length. These haters are so focused on Taeyeon that they completely forgot about Amber who appears on most of the MV, LMAO.

Anyways, I'm looking forward to live stages in music shows. Too bad Taeyeon won't be performing on the stage. Hopefully, she makes at least one appearance, maybe along with all those friends together!",196,2015-02-12T22:29:50Z

I'm not a F(x) fan only have like 1 or 2 songs of them so i can be talking shit but I do know that Amber is talented as hell and she could handle something a lot better than this. I'm not saying SHE did anything wrong but SM did by giving her this instead of a much better song that I'm pretty sure they can do. The MV is ok and she looks awesome I just don't like the song itself. 
Second let me talk about this Taeyeon thing, I am a little jealous (or butthurt whatever you wanna call it) because she's dating one of my bias but that doesn't mean I'm hating on her I do think she's really pretty and talented as hell and i loved her parts on the song (her voice is dope) I just don't feel comfortable with her dating my ""oppa"", I prefer to not watch/read anything about her because it'll hurt less because I do have fucking feelings for Baekhyun because I am an EXO-L.

I knew you'd fuck over an f(X) member with a lackluster song. What was the point of this? I mean it wasn't god awful, but come oooonnnn..... be for real. She can move and her lyrics are okay at times. Do better with her! You all are always pulling all the damn stops out for EXO, put in so much work for GG, go head over heels for SHINee, you just have to put in the work for TVXQ and SuJu, but when it comes to f(X) it's like ""here bitches, take these pieces of yarn and bits of old bandages and make something work."" If you're not going to do right by them then let them go. ""Red Light"" was the best album they had, but their lead song wasn't. Guarantee she has a better song than this one.

@breadstal,"Not the biggest fan of the song; the beat is nice but the rest....not so much. The chorus and the rest of the song doesn't seem to connect very well. Taeyeon's ""Uh Huh""and ""Oh Yeahs"" get really annoying after a while, it sort of reminds me of MissA's Hush when they say ""Yeah"" very often and it gets so repetitive.

I love how Amber had her friends take part in the video! Amber shows off how well her connections are. XD Taeyeon was highly unnecessary though; her part didn't do much for the song. And yes, I do understand that Amber asked her to participate in the video and song but that won't change how I feel about her part. I am excited to see how Wendy will sing alongside Amber for her debut stage!

Though this song was a let down for me personally, I can't wait to hear the rest of the album because Beautiful was just...beautiful. Still so proud of our llama!!",0,2015-02-12T22:07:14Z

I'm an EXO-L and f(x) stan and I'm totally okay with having Taeyeon in the mv... but it makes me feel kinda bad for Amber since it looks like SM had doubts with Amber (as solo) to get chart hits and bring in the money (sales) therefore, they used Taeyeon to get more views(popularity) n sales. Whatever, it is atleast SM looked towards F(x) at lasttt! ToT But, I would have liked AMBER to sing the last part of the song bcuz it is HER SOLO afterall.",4,2015-02-12T22:03:23Z

Have you considered that maybe these characters are not established in Korea, that's why sm put features in the song as marketing schemes? Jonghyun, Taemin and Kyuhyun are quite established so probably dats why they didn't need more famous characters to help pump their popularity. 

I don't know about you but I don't really think it's respectful to hate on Taeyeon considering amber said she asked Taeyeon herself. I'm not a sone so I'm not biased and shit. ",0,2015-02-12T21:59:15Z

@ablestmage,"Song itself was just okay, even as a fan of brass in general. I was mainly watching just for the Taeyeon parts (and tempted to refer to it as ""Taeyeon - Shake That Brass, feat. Amber f(x)"").. I keep thinking the girl playing the trumpet at 00:22 is Hyoyeon.. ",7,2015-02-12T21:44:28Z
@Isteveh,"Why are SM fans such jokes? Why the hell do you guys hate within the same damn company? I guess thats why its YG""Family"" JYP""Nation"" Cube""United"" and SM ""town"" since its easy to dislike people in your own town it makes sense. Not all fans are like that but that is the main reason SM gets so much hate. It's not the artists its the fans. It's why I myself try to distance myself from them recently.",93,2015-02-12T21:44:28Z

Amber needs someone should read as rap and compose a catchy song because this is ridiculous and is a complete disaster.

They ruin Taeyeon's voice in this song.

And please someone tell Amber...  a brass has a lot more melody , the song is more basic than  Katy perry music",109,2015-02-12T21:38:07Z

@vivvee4569,"Not gonna lie, I wasn't really excited for this debut but obviously my preconceptions of it were wrong. 
SM obviously do not show case amber's true rapping skills in f(x)'s songs enough, or properly because that kinda just shocked my world. I'm quite a big fan of f(x) but even I can admit Amber's rapping skills don't reach the level of what I consider top notch (sorry if I offend but it's only my UNBIAS opinion). 
But honestly, that was great, a little repetitive with 'shake that bass' but I actually really loved it. It's a great song to just dance and be stupid to. Also, love the cameos, hyoyeon is adorable ^^",0,2015-02-12T21:18:59Z

@sususushi0,I was scrolling through the comments and my non-kpop fan friend who was looking over my shoulder asked me why there was so much Taeyeon hate. She didn't even know who Taeyeon was. This shows how much you guys hate on her. You act as if she's a book character or something. Do I need to remind you that she is human? She seems really sad these days and I'm worried that she's developing depression. You guys are assholes omfg.,1,2015-02-12T21:18:38Z
@AJ-xq5wm,"I love the choreographyyy hahaha lollll omgoshhhhh Amberrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
I can't get over it, I love them both. But I think they should have featured other than Taeyeon because Taeyeon is in too much spotlight, why not SM give a spotlight to other SM artists too? Maybe another member from F(x) or from any other SM groups, or maybe another rapper featured with Amber since Amber's genre is usually rap. This is just my opinion, i'm not bashing any among Taeyeon and Amber, I love them both and Taeyeon is my bias lolll",0,2015-02-12T21:18:28Z

@seannguyen3484,"it's a fun song to jam to, it's basically a rap song anyway so there must be a hook for it and Taeyeon did it well, and seriously she got about 28s out of a 3:37 minute mv, that isnt too much for a feat. at all i dont see the damn reasons why are you people complaining
if Taeyeon got even less than those 28s it wouldn't be an Amber ft. Taeyeon song and it's not like Amber can rap and sing the high notes at the same time, there must be some mixture of different voices for a song like this
finally, no, SM is not forcing anyone here, Amber wrote the song years ago, she personally came to ask Taeyeon so she acts as a producer for a music video as well, and you should be happy if you are her fans because she's satisfied with her product, i dont think you know how to direct this better than Amber herself, now if you cant enjoy the fun and the music she's trying to send to everyone, fuck off and let others have fun, thanks",7,2015-02-12T21:03:50Z

Because as we all know, she had a SNSD comeback and a TTS comeback and now has a solo debut coming up but Taeyeon is pretty much at her peak right now with many people hating and supporting her right now and most of these antis are butthurt EXO-Ls because she's dating their ""oppa."" I think Taeyeon was great here! She didn't have the whole song to herself she only had a small little part and some harmonizing and she sounded amazing. She also knows how to make facial expressions because she's so beautiful in every shot. I'm not Taeyeon biased but Hyoyeon biased and I've gotta say, Hyoyeon looked stunningly beautiful here!

- I know Amber asked for taeyeon

- im not ""hating"" nor ""complaining but just merely stating my opinion. Which is what the comment section is for.
And even though i dont have to explain the reasons for my coment, I will just so that certain people can read that MY OPINION on taeyeon being featured is not ""hating"" nor ""complaining"".

@mvovon,"All the comments defending Taeyeon Is.. pointless tbh.
Why you even wasting your time.
Even If 10 years pass, there's still gonna be people saying the same shit as the are now, what you're saying Is going to do literally nothing, It doesn't affect Youtube comment-ers, they don't care, they'll just do It as long as Anon.
While I agree with It, everyone's a Born Hater and come on. 
This Is YOUTUBE comments, we're bound to come across, Fedora wearing, Koreaboo Weaboo, Stubborn & Closed-minded people, It's nothing new.
IMO; I like this song, It's upbeat and fun, even though I'd like a climax In the song too lol, It doesn't matter, like this song a lot, It's very Amber, and the the Idols at the back featuring Is pretty nice too. ",0,2015-02-12T20:27:07Z

@hotofanbestnameever6076,Imo Taeyeon's voice fit pretty well in here it's so clear and gentle ^_^ even got goosebumps. Sure in some parts she could've sounded more aggressive but that's just some minor things I think could've been changed :) But people why with so all the hate? :( Of course it's good to express your opinion but at least try to be more sensible. It pains me to read all these comments when this video itself is about friends working together. No one should be bashed if one doesn't fit somewhere :(,1,2015-02-12T20:24:11Z

In my opinion I liked very much, since Amber has great charisma and is a great rapper. This rhythm is very funny, but really good and draws much attention the background color.
 The rap of Amber is accompanied with the beautiful and amazing voice of Taeyeon, do not understand why they criticize this, because they believe that this is unnecessary, if the Kpop has always worked with a vocal and a rap, to achieve a balance in the production of music. Congratulations Amber 👏👏👏 this is really her style and Fighting Taeyeon 👍﻿",32,2015-02-12T20:19:55Z

Mi llama no necesita de esas personas para triunfar, Las personas que dicen que Taeyeon opacó a Amber en su debut desde ese momento ustedes le estab dando más importancia a Tae que a Amber, solo por el simple hecho de insultarla. El debut es de Amber solo de ella, y creo que Ambas combinaron muy bien, un buen rap con una buena voz.

The song is awesome! (I did find the uhu and yeah parts kind if annoying though).
I really liked the MV too, Jackson<3

I didn't like Taeyeon in this mv, while the others were having fun, she was just sitting there doing nothing at all. But that's not her fault, unless she is the one who directed the mv, then it is...

What the hell? Why is EVERY comment (litteraly huh, all comments on top) are people saying TaeYeon is unecessary? What the hell is wrong with people? If you think that, can't you just enjoy Amber then?

It's one of the best collaboration in SM, I hope they will make another SNSD/F(x)/even Red Velvet... But naaaaah, people keep complaining about Tae like, really ._.? What is point in your life? Saying what is necessary? In case you didn't know, it's Amber who asked TaeYeon  to sing with her, and Tae accept and acted cool with her. It's not SM like most of you said. Maybe it's for views, maybe it's for awards, maybe it's just for marketing but who cares? Two awesome and beautiful artist who are talented sing together, and you, ,just sit here complaining about ONE FEATURING in ONE MINI-ALBUM. Like. NO THANKS. Who are you to say someone is necessary or not?? It's a thing I'll never understand. 

Y'all saying that everyone is talking only about her. But that's what you are doing : talking ONLY about the featuring, not enjoying the fact that it's Amber debut, that others artist are here or just the MV. Please, go listen to the rest of the album you ain't happy here, Amber (and Taeyeon) don't need that kind of negativity in their lives.",1,2015-02-12T19:18:30Z

@DeerHannie,"saying taeyeon is unnecessary and  then claiming that you would rather have ailee or luna mostly to do the feat, its almost saying that they're unnecassary too because right now, you would prefer amber to be purely alone for this debut. i've never seen so much confusion in people's mind nowadays.

moving on, i just find it unfair how taeyeon gets the most bullshit when actually the main focus point is amber, and not about who features all that. amber worked hard on this song and album and for most of the comments to focus on the latter topic, it's disheartening. so just keep quiet and enjoy the music, and hope that your favs do a feat on live shows too.

Not only did she do great with Beautiful, but this song was catchy and the video was so much fun to watch! 

I don't know why people are complaining about Taeyeon stealing the spotlight or whatever but Amber personally asked her to be in it, and she asked everyone else too of course. And we all know Amber could've done an amazing job with or without featuring anyone else so why get so mad about it, guys? 

Just enjoy the music and the video and have fun with it! SHAKE YOUR BRASS  ",0,2015-02-12T19:04:33Z

@TheOriginalJellicle,"Y'know what? I'm not a Sone, but I actualy like Taeyeon in this. Her and Amber's vocal ""tones"" are very different, so she brings another sound into the song and it works. Yes, Amber could have done it all by herself, but with another singer featuring there's an extra element of variety that otherwise wouldn't be there. The only thing I'd change about this is give her more to do - that girl can really dance, and you've got her doing little more than sitting on a box fluttering her eyelashes during a song with a pretty cool routine? Come on.

If you don't like Taeyeon, then just move on and ignore this and listed to Amber's other songs on this mini-album. Taeyeon [in my personal opinion] has a voice that really suits this song - - Amber and Taeyeon balance each other in a really good way. So why don't you please just back off from her like she's ruining it, because if that were true everyone would have to believe that, which we all don't.",139,2015-02-12T18:43:32Z

Seriously, you'll be happier if you just chill the fuck out. This isn't a huge deal. AMBER HAS A SOLO ALBUM.

@MDabu22,"Why can't people just enjoy the music? Jfc. Amber personally asked Taeyeon to feature in her song. Don't like it? Fine. But don't hate on Taeyeon for doing something for a friend. If you don't think her part fits, then fine again. But complaining about it like it's the end of the world won't change anything. Remember Amber was the one who composed and wrote the song, putting Tae's part was what SHE thought would fit. I personally think Taeyeon's part gave the song more life. It wasn't too much but it was enough to give it some spark. And to anyone saying Amber should be the one singing, she needs to showcase it more and Taeyeon took it all. Listen to the whole damn album. Amber sings 90% of the time and sounds really good doing it. One song with a feature that she wanted isn't going to kill you.

If Taeyeon didn't do it then another person would have so therefore Amber wanted another singer on this song. If you don't like it then don't listen, but stop being little whiny bitches.

I really hope Amber's debut will go well, her other song Beautiful is great too. I like it how she has completely different songs on one album. And Taeyeon didn't outshine Amber at all imo. She's obviously here to bring views, but since it sounds good who cares lol. I don't think Amber could sing Taeyeon's parts at a live performance.

I love this video. It looks fun to be in and I am sure everyone had a lot fun during the making. And I love that even artists from other companies cameo in it. It shows how well connected and friendly Amber is with everyone.

I can't wait to see this song performed live and will keep my fingers crossed for the day when Taeyeon might perform alongside Amber.

@yamapinokanojo,"I'M LOVING THIS SONG AND MV JUST THE WAY IT IS!
Why should anyone bother complaining about Tae? You should see that she doesn't take many scenes and her part is just on point. It gives more color and A BREAK which if wasn't been done would make the song a little bit boring. Her voice compliments the song.
If you think she steals attention, it is you who probably have waited for her even than you waited for Amber. SM did a great job w/this single. Amber'll slay~ :D♥♥",1,2015-02-12T17:13:34Z

@SarahSmurFK,"First of all , the song is catchy and the mv is really cool -i loved both, especially that amber's friends are part of it ( ailee& eric must have been buzy) .Second of all , all of u are insulting taeyeon;saying that she took all the attention,when u so-called fans are giving her full attention.Taeyeon appeard only for approximately a minute if not less ,in a video of 3:37 and sang only a line( that was beautiful) , and yet all u could see was Taeyeon. woow u must be really paranoid !!.besides , it was AMBER who asked tae personally to feature in the song ""http://mwave.interest.me/enewsworld/en/article/87332/fxs-amber-personally-asked-snsds-taeyeon-to-feature-in-her-new-song "". Kpop fans are never satisfied . Funny thing is that there are others in the MV but pple focus only on taeyeon, when they can focus on Amber .Since u didn't pay that much attention to other appearances , do the same with taeyeon coz she's certainly not all over the MV .
The song is energetic and beautiful , Taeyeon was a good addition too .her presence in the song didn't steal attention or ruin the song coz amber is seen throughout the whole 3:37 , and Taeyeon's part is so good and fits the song . Amber fightiiiiiiiing , your song ROCK , it really makes me wanna jump around .

Amber is too cool as always, and taeyeon makes the video complete. You think about it, a song with fast raplike vibe will be missing differing vocals or the product might just come out with that feeling that its missing something. No matter what anyone says, this song is the BOMB. And everyone looked like they were having fun dancing in the video. I love it. Amber will be slaying those charts.

2. If you came only for Taeyeon, don't go posting hateful comments about Amber.. You don't want f(stans) to go posting hateful comments when Taeyeon's solo comes right?
3. If you don't like both of them and came because of all the other artist, well, remember they're Amber friends supporting her. Be respectful and support Amber like what your idol did

@TheLovelyflight,Honestly you guys call yourselves Amber fans when you a spreading toxic hate. Remember that Amber speaks English and will most likely see all this hate towards Taeyeon (who was barely shown in the video). Why do people have to ruin good things with useless complaints. Do you think complaining is going to magically erase Taeyeon from the video? No it wont. Now while I sit back and enjoy Amber's infectious song and attitude y'all can keep acting like petulant children. I am seriously disappointed in everyone....,92,2015-02-12T16:39:48Z

JUST ENJOY THE DAMN MV AND SONG AND LEAVE TAEYEON UNNIE ALONE! And if Taeyeon unnie bothers you so much when she appears ONLY for a few seconds then you probably shouldn't have came and watched the mv because it was clear that Taeyeon unnie was featuring. ,1,2015-02-12T16:35:08Z

You guys are all focusing on Taeyeon and keep comment of her and said Amber is the main character asking us why focus on Taeyeon. But it useless, because you also still talking about her. Taeyeon is trying to help her to debut. Why you guys are blaming her. She did nothing wrong.(Sorry for poor English )",1,2015-02-12T16:26:59Z

People are posting bashful comments towards Taeyeon. Well, Amber personally asked Taeyeon to be featured in her song. Its ridiculous to read all those hateful comments. If Amber wants her to be featured on her song, then its her decision, not yours. 

Plus, yes, opinions are welcome but some opinions are not meant to be told to all (especially when you an anti or hater of that specific person. Its immature. yeah you)",2,2015-02-12T16:22:24Z

I'm not even a sone or a Taeyeon fan to be honest. The song throughout was rather flat and lots of repetitive 'shake that brass' parts. All together I felt like I was listening to 2 or 3 different songs at once, just mixed and blended here and there. There wasn't a moment when tension builded up where the song really grabbed my attention, because there was no actual climax in this. I'm just not a big fan of layed-back type of songs I guess. Please don't shoot me, it's just my personal opinion. Go ahead and like it if you want. I do support Amber. I love her.",1,2015-02-12T16:06:17Z

@josefina121,"Ok but her album is so good?? Shake That Brass is a really happy, upbeat and colorful song that makes you wanna dance and jump around. Then there is Heights which gives me a night-like feeling, and her vocals are amazing. And I Just Wanna is simply perfect and one of my favorites bc i never thought  that she would release the english version of Goodbye Summer (even though featuring kyungsoo would have been like 10 times better because of his english accent lol, but still, I'm glad that she featured Eric, he definitely needs more recognition). And Beautiful is a beautiful (yeah, ironically), especially the lyrics at the rap part, it's that one song that cheers you up when you're feeling down. And finally, Love Run seems like that sweet romantic song (and the chorus has me feeling some type of way and I love it!).

For some reason I expected a lot from Amber and her album happens to be amazing, I think I have never liked all the songs of and sm album before like to keep listening to all of them for the rest of the day. Congrats Amber!

@cheffaaay,"Just as I have feared.

Good MV. Love the cameos. Amber is a good rapper but she apparently is a way better singer but she gets essentially no singing lines in the song she's gonna promote for *her* debut. I'm callin' it now. I like Beautiful a heck lot more.

After listening to this song which line did you remember most? Without the help of the MV, I'm doubting it's catchy enough. I played the song in Superstar SMTOWN and they cut the game before the singing started. I feared it would be like this. I was hoping SM would prove me wrong. Oh how very disappointing.

Still, 화이팅! TEAM LLAMA ALL THE WAY!

Funny how everyone celebrated the other artists in the video, but complained about Taeyeon stealing the spotlight.
And here she is unpretentious singing only one real line in the end of the song and some ""yeah"" and ""uh-uh"".
Anyway, I prefer the other song by Amber, the one in which she sings. It's a fact that the majority of people are here to see the cameo of the other idols.",0,2015-02-12T15:24:13Z

@Hyxnjxn,"That was cute. Better than I expected. I thought Teayeon wasn't really gonna sing at all once I saw that I was getting towards the end of the video and then she did end up singing something and it fit the song very well. Her voice goes with amber's very well. And for people saying asking ""why is there a need for Taeyeon"" well let's see. She harmonises with Amber throughout the entire song from beginning to end. Then when Taeyeon actually sings her part. It's supposed to be the climax of the song. Now if you removed Taeyeon and just had Amber rapping through the entire song. Their would be no harmonies. There would be no climax to the song. You're practically removing a musical element that gives the song it's depth and makes it complete. Also if it was just Amber rapping the entire song you guys still would have found something to complain about. So Taeyeon fit the song perfectly. And since I mentioned harmonies those harmonies between Amber and Taeyeon while Amber was rapping. Flawless. People said Taeyeon would outshine Amber. False. Taeyeon didn't outshine Amber and believe it or not Amber didn't outshine Taeyeon. It was a perfect blend of Amber and Taeyeon. ",140,2015-02-12T15:21:31Z

@shazwanibms,"just freaking stop already. stop asking why taeyeon is featuring on amber's solo debut song. amber actually personally requested for taeyeon to feature on her song. ((THIS HAS BEEN CONFIRMED BY AMBER HERSELF)) so don't freaking hate on taeyeon for that. don't use this featuring as an excuse to jump on the ""hate taeyeon"" bandwagon. y'all need to stop caring so much about taeyeon's appearance and just focus on the freaking song. if you make this mv seem like it's all about taeyeon, it'll be all about taeyeon. look, just treat taeyeon as if she's the icing on the cake or something. and her parts don't actually overshadow amber's. so, don't be a bitch and start ranting about why the hell is taeyeon here. bc all i know is that amber totally appreciate taeyeon's assistance and her existence. and it's probably amher's dream to work with her long-time idol, kim taeyeon. also, other sm artists featured on the sm soloists' debut songs too. kyuhyun, taemin on henry's trap. amber on henry's 1-4-3. chanyeol, tao on zhoumi's rewind. plus, featurings will usually stop during the first or second week of promotions IF YOU NOTICED. soon, you'll get amber all to yourselves again. and fyi, wendy will be performing tomorrow on music bank w amber instead of taeyeon. you happy now???? 

if you're still gonna bitch after everything i've said then........... ok continue bitching. but remember, nothing's gonna change the fact that taeyeon's still a featuring artist on shake that brass. and you? you're just a fan. suck it up.",17,2015-02-12T15:19:35Z
