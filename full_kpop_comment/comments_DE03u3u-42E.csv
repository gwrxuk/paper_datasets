The only comment I have is the camera work. I would love to see and focus on the whole choreography but it just kept on zooming in and out. I saw the now deleted dance practice video on twitter and I think I prefer that 1st one.

But putting that aside, Taeyong's dancing skills, style and energy are evident on both videos. He always gives his all in everything he do. This album is indeed a masterpiece. Good job Taeyong and the team.",41,2024-03-05T15:58:29Z
