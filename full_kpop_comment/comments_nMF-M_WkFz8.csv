@nuningpurjiati9643,"Suara jaenyun very good,ngebass dan doyoung suara tingginya yang aku suka. Lirik lagunya bagus tapi kok sedih ya....
Liriknya: kalau punya perasaan jangan dipendam nanti sesak napas,disampaikan aja ke dia. Ditolak atau tidak itu sudah resiko yang harus ditanggung. Resiko komunikasi pertemanan agak menurun frekuensinya,tapi itu berjalan beberapa waktu aja. Selanjutnya pasti suatu saat dia akan merasakan biasanya komunikasi terus, sekarang kok nggak. Pasti dia akan merindukan komunikasi itu tadi dan akhirnya dia akan menghubungi Anda.
Liriknya sama yg saya alami. Hanya bedanya tidak dipendam tapi disampaikan, agar dia tahu. Memang resikonya sama yang saya sampaikan diatas tadi.Dan akhirnya saya dan suami awalnya teman sekarang jadi pasangan yang bahagia sampai sekarang (22 th).",1,2023-05-07T06:19:24Z

@splashxuniql6390,"오늘은 자기 전에
니 목소리 듣다가 자고 싶다
내일은 저녁때쯤
너를 데리러 가보고도 싶다
니가 한숨을 쉬어낼 땐
내가 몽땅 다 가져가 널 쉬게 하고 싶다
니가 너무너무 피곤하면
끌어안고 토닥 재우고 싶다
그냥 지금도 니가 보고 싶다
내가 이런 말을 하면 혹시 멀어질까 봐
너랑 멀어질까 봐, 니가 멀어질까 봐
내가 이런 말을 하면 니가 싫어할까 봐
내가 싫어질까 봐, 나를 밀어낼까 봐
그래서 오늘도 결국 다 참아내고
어쩔 수 없이 건넨 평범한 말 ""안녕""
내일은 마침 주말인데
너를 데리고 좋은 곳에 가보고도 싶다
혹시 니가 허락한다면
니 손을 잡고 같이 걷고도 싶다
내가 이런 말을 하면 혹시 멀어질까 봐
너랑 멀어질까 봐, 니가 멀어질까 봐
내가 이런 말을 하면 니가 싫어할까 봐, 부담스러울까 봐
지금 이 친구 사이도 모두 없던 일처럼 사라질까 봐
건넨 평범한 말 ""안녕""
어쩔 수 없이 건네 ""잘 들어가, 안녕""",3,2023-04-24T17:13:05Z

@nandaanandoo,"DJJ, at least for me, feels like a gift as Jaehyun’s fans. Jaehyun is an all rounder according to SM, but in a group as packed as NCT, he sometimes gets overshadowed. It hurts especially when I saw people undermining his main vocalist status. But in DJJ, not only singing, but he also got to show us his dancing (which is sadly also underrated). We don’t talk enough about his talents, and how all rounder is truly an apt role for him. I’ve been waiting for SM to showcase his talents to their fullest for years. So thank you DJJ for this chance, not only for Jaehyun but also for Doyoung and Jungwoo. I will cherish this unit forever 🫶🏻",113,2023-04-24T11:33:29Z

@JAEHYUNCentral,"It's really great that Jaehyun has been able to show a lot of his singing ability with DOJAEJUNG. We know he's a great vocalist but ngl it's frustrating sometimes to see people underplay how technically GREAT he is just because he's the ""all-rounder"" and doesn't sing as often as the main vocals in 127 title tracks. He's genuinely a great singer who's not just good at holding a note, he's AMAZING and this song is further proof (on top of existing proof). He's SINGING!!!! His heart out and not only that but his delivery is really so emotional and I love that",57,2023-04-24T11:05:51Z
