이게 무슨말이냐면 ㅋㅋ 
웬만한 캐럿들은 알탠데

이제 도겸이가 편의점? 그런데에서 뭘사와서 검은본지를 들고있었는데
민규랑 갑자기“&@@8&” 이러면서 싸워
그러도니 갑자기
도겸이가 “&@₩&”이러면서 
검은봉지를 바닥에 탁 던졌는데
민규가“야 너 뭐하냐? 주워“
도겸이가”쒸익쒸익“
”주우라고“
그래서 도겸이가 가서 주웠음 ㅋㅋㅋ
이 스토리 인데

이제 승관이랑 있었던
회색수건 사건이있어요(심각한거 아님)
이제 도겸이랑 승관이랑 숙소가 같았는데
이제 계속 어색했데요
근데 이제 도겸이랑 승관이랑 또 싸워 
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
근데 도겸이가 검은봉지 때처럼 또
화가났나봐요
그래서 수건을 던지려고 하는데
이제 승관이가
”던져봐, 던지면 어떻게 되는지 봐“
이랬는데
도겸이가 
”어쩌라고!!“ 이러면서

FROM THAT time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[Mt. 4:17]

I CAME not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
[Lk. 5:32]

I TELL you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
[Lk. 13:3]

FOR ALL have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
[Ro. 3:23]

TO DAY, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear His voice, harden not your hearts.
[Heb. 4:7]

REPENT YE therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord;
[Acts 3:19]

THE LORD is not slack concerning His promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

I'm so glad to have found them. 💯💯💯💯💯 Jeonghan meditating in the middle. 😂😂😂 Woozi using the electric razor and pestering Dino. 😂😂😂 Wonwoo doing his own parts and surprised when Seungkwan suddenly started doing his part. 😂😂😂 Dino throwing the plastic bag. 😂😂😂 The8 being hyper like Hoshi. 😂😂😂 Seungkwan and Hoshi chasing each other. 😂😂😂 Seungkwan arranging everyone. 😂😂😂 S.Coups getting up on the plank and imitating Mingyu's height. 😂😂😂 Vernon with the dumbbell and his shoe flying off. 😂😂😂 Jun with the guitar. 😂😂😂 Joshua done with the video game. 😂😂😂 Dokyeom imitating Jeonghan. 😂😂😂 Hoshi imitating Seungkwan. 😂😂😂 Mingyu tripping over Jeonghan. 😂😂😂,3,2022-03-06T09:02:03Z

@shielamaycalo295,"In true SEVENTEEN fashion, the group took things a step further than the typical part-switch dance video: instead of just swapping parts, each of the members made a complete transformation into the member that he was covering, imitating his mannerisms and even referencing some inside jokes that fans will recognize immediately.

Highlights of the video include Hoshi pretending to be knocked to the ground by a flying kick from Seungkwan, Jun and Joshua acting out a physical altercation involving a ukulele, S.Coups tripping over a meditating Jeonghan, DK and The8 rubbing their chests together in an overly affectionate hug, Woozi pretending to shave Dino’s face, and Mingyuconstantly attempting to bite the other members.

Towards the end of the clip, Joshua and Dino also hilariously act out the infamous “black plastic bag” fight between DK and Mingyu, with Dino angrily throwing a plastic bag on the floor, then sheepishly complying when Joshua orders him to pick it up.

mingyu - cheol with his nagging especially for mingyu and his clumsiness sksksk
seokmin - embodied jeonghan's chill attitude AND trying to clown his evil angel agenda (okay im loving this switch sksksk)

hansol - jihoon's chill outfit (aka the iconic slides) + the pink dumbells representing jihoon's gym addiction

3:05 - (the8 as hoshi) hoshi's tiger agenda (hoshi kept pushing that he looks like a tiger and even owns an insane amount of tiger stuff (plushies, watch, shoes, caps, phone case, clothes) and he LITERALLY thinks that hes a whole ass tiger not a human

@ZiDang91,"Don’t get me wrong, this is hillarious (especially the black plastic bag ) but I feel like they tried to include too much details and was too focused on the props and acting as each other that the “performance” lacks the usual smoothness of the other part switch videos. Their other part switch versions, especially Pretty U and before that were really satisfying to watch because they had fun and did crazy stuffs but at the same time the dance was still strangly on point.

포인트가 너무 많아서 시선을 어디에 두어야하죠?
왜 내 눈은 열세개가 아닌거얔ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ🤣❤🤣❤
한명한명 포인트가 너무 많은데
혹시 파트스위치 아니고 고잉셉 특별편 아닌가요🤣🤣
일단 처음 제일먼저 눈에 띈거
명호➡️순영
파이팅 외치는 순영이 왤케 잘따라하는뎈ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
(민망한 순영이 킬포)
카메라 귀신같이 찾고 손하트 날리는 순영잌ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
명호 렢라 안무 호랑해로 대신한거도 킬포ㅠㅠ

부순 완벽 케미 그대로 재현ㅠㅠㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
석민➡️정한
아닠ㅋㅋ 겸이도 보라색 자켓 찰떡이네

민규➡️승철
승철이 훅 지나가고 민규 나오는거 너무커엽😭❤
와중에 점프하면서 잇몸만개 힙한표정ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
(그런 민규가 웃기고 기엽고 민망한 승철이는 덤)
2:18 승철이 빙의 너무웃김ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
""아 뭐하는거야 맨날 그렇게 (치고?)다니면 어떡해""
민규 한풀이한거 아니지?ㅎㅋㅎㅋㅎㅋㅎㅋㅎ
(와중엨ㅋㅋㅋ 또저런다는듯 고개 절레절레 젓는
승관이가 제일 킬포🤣🤣🤣🤣)
승철➡️민규
웃다가 정신차리고
혀낼름하고 민규 파트하는거 첫째마자...? 기여워ㅠㅠ
2:18 지나가다갘ㅋㅋㅋ치는 민규 버릇 재현하깈ㅋㅋㅋ
본인인척하는 민규한테 혼나면서 미안해 무한반복ㅋㅋ
근데 왜 사과 정한이한테 안하고 민규한테해?🤣🤣
찬➡️석민
아니 차니...브릿지...무슨일....? 미쳤어😭❤😭❤
(와중에 사이드로 웃음보터진 겸뾰 시강🤣❤)

1:52 얘 표정좀 보세욬ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
멤버들 '과나~'하는데 행복해 죽을라함ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
2:11 본인인척하는 명호한테 맞고
승관이인척 째려보다 바로 안무맞추는
부순 환장의 케미 그대로 재현ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
2:27 자기 파트 챙긴다고 앞으로 뛰어나오는거보솤ㅋㅋ
(2:30 승관이가 ""야""라고 부르는거 갸웃김🤣🤣)
(얘들아 너무 진지하면 지는거야🤗🤗ㅋㅋㅋㅋ)
지수➡️준휘
준휘 요즘 게임 많이하니?ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
지수 핸드폰 들고있는거 왤케 커엽고 웃김🤣🤣🤣

손잡고 안무하면서 엄지 세우는거 킬포😭❤😭❤
준휘➡️지수
준휘인척 하는 지수 밀어내고
지수인척 파트챙기는 준휘 너무 커여움😭❤😭❤

너무 완벽한 장면 아닙니까 여기..?ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
2:36 전동면도기 손에 곽쥐고
카메라 잡아먹을듯이 노려보면서
발차기 안무 열정적으로 하는거 너무 기여움😭❤😭❤
(와중에 찬이 머리 쓰담쓰담하는 민규 뭔데...😊😊)
(+자기 안무하는 형이 웃긴 찬이)
(+열정적인 지훈이가 웃긴 승관이)
승관➡️원우
2:01 자기 파트 챙기던 원우 대신
하이파이브 하며 튀어나오는 승관이
뒤에서 그걸 지켜보는 원우
이거 비지엠깔아주세요 ㅎㅋㅎㅋㅎㅋㅎㅋㅎ
정한➡️명호
와인들고 깨알 명상하는거 너무 기여움
(와중에 틈새 안놓치고 의자에서 쉬던 먕먕이 킬포)
와중엨ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
민규인척하는 승철이가 오늘도 지나가다 쳤는데
잠깐 쳐다보고 바로 잔깨졌나 확인하는

@doremifasolasiyeon9005,"for the references :D
0:05 minghao as hoshi who often leads the cheer backstage before svt starts their performance.
0:41 wonu as vernon wearing vernon style glasses, jeonghan as minghao holding a wine glass bc hao likes wines (svt club)
0:50 mingyu as seungcheol who has a habit of biting svt members when he's flustered or excited.
1:06 hoshi as seungkwan, copying his gestures when he talks while holding iced coffee americano (seungkwan's fav) seungkwan kicks him (um arent u supposed to be copying wonu)
1:22 joshua as jun who is always facing his phone and jun as joshua who likes to play the guitar and sing sunday morning.
1:25 vernon as woozi whose hobby is working out
1:34 minghao as hoshi, doing a heart sign bc hoshi does that a lot
1:41 wonu as vernon, vernon's weird dance move that he did in sbs gayo daejun 2019 (?) as well as in l&r choreo.
2:07 jeonghan as minghao, idk about this but they once jokingly challenged minghao to try meditating. idk he must be learning to meditate recently. he seems like that kind of guy lol. 
2:17 seungcheol as CLUMSY mingyu. fun fact: mingyu trips EVERYDAY. 
2:35 woozi as dino copying his PASSIONATE dance
2:45 dk as jeonghan who like to sleep when he finds an opportunity. he said that he can sleep everywhere.
2:51 vernon as woozi, holding a dumbbell cus woozi likes to workout
2:55 dino as dk, throwing his hat. in gose insomnia ep, they said dk throws things when he's angry. he threw a gray towel at seungkwan and he threw a black plastic bag at mingyu who told him to pick it up, which dk really did picked it up
3:06 minghao imitating hoshi's tiger agenda
3:09 woozi shaving dino's nonexistent beard. in insomnia gose ep, he joked about dino shaving after getting drunk the night before. also, back in rookie days, a member saw dino shaving for the first time and dino got flustered by it. 
3:13 seungcheol emphasizing mingyu's height and seungkwan as wonwoo copying his robot-like dance. wonu is a *dance machine* wbk.
3:14 mingyu as seungcheol, copying the way he takes selfies with people.
3:28 seungkwan as MC wonu (particularly debate night gose ep)
3:36 woozi (as dino) shaves minghao (as hoshi) who's dancing to bring it (by hoshwoozi combo) choreo
3:43 dino and dk copying dk's weird hand thing (?) in ""if"" episode when he got scared and shookt by the hidden box
3:45 joshua and jun, joshua's weird....talent that he flexed many times before.
there's so much going on so i probably missed loads of things.
for new stans, ya'll should try watch going seventeen,svt club,  one fine day, inside seventeen and hit the road. if you don't feel mentally well, don't watch hit the road. it's basically a documentary of the boys showing their vulnerable side.",458,2020-07-19T13:51:04Z
