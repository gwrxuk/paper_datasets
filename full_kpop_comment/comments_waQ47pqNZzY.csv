funnily enough dk's team had already won on the original round (first round) and would have remained winners had they not agreed to the deal lol, the things they do for content indeed. next time, they should have a MVP award for the game that makes them immune to the penalty  (though idk if dk would have won it or seungkwan or maybe even mingyu)",8,2023-09-13T09:09:46Z

@2angelachinzah110,"For me the real winners were Hoshi' s team, they seems to genuinely enjoyed the game and they were also enjoyable to watch not to mention their cheering is top notch and seems to ease the set and spread positivity all around. Even though they lost the last round they won 3 rounds( if I'm not wrong) so it's a clear win from my side. Sometimes watching too much competitive energy drains me and i hope sometimes they could play wholeheartedly without caring too much about the outcome in future episodes.

The younger members also seems scared of him, but not out of respect. Like he hits them or yell at them. Ive noticed this in most GOSE episodes as well. I hope the8 can invite him in his meditations so he can manage his anger issues.",3,2022-03-31T22:13:32Z

-The fact that Dino’s turn was against Seungkwan and Just as bad Dino was playing Seunkwan was the exact opposite 😭

- VERNON. A whole new side of vernon took birth🤌🏽😭
 (his “sad” expressions and him mentally supporting his hyungs and telling i love you with the STRAIGHTEST face)

- Dokyeoms EVIL LAUGHTER ☠️✨ 

- < Tribal SVT >

- Dino’s laugh obviously 🥺💘

- loud Wonwoo.

Honestly I’ll have to list like 100 things from the whole episode because it was just so iconic😭✋🏼✋🏼",0,2022-03-31T09:22:49Z
