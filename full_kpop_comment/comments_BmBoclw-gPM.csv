@cnar7954,"I'm in my bed
And you're not here
And there's no one to blame but the drink in my wandering hands
Forget what I said
It's not what I meant
And I can't take it back, I can't unpack the baggage you left

What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling

You said you care
And you missed me too

And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you

And the coffee's out
At the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say

What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling

And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again

What am I now? What am I now?
What if you're someone I just want around
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?

It's not what I meant
And I can't take it back, I can't unpack the baggage you left
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
You said you care
And you missed me too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you
And the coffee's out
At the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again
What am I now? What am I now?
What if you're someone I just want around
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling",1,2023-04-18T16:03:41Z

And you're not here
And there's no one to blame
But the drink in my wandering hands
Forget what I said
It's not what I meant
And I can't take it back
I can't unpack the baggage you left
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
You said you care
And you missed me too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you
And the coffee's out
At the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again
What am I now? What am I now?
What if you're someone I just want around
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling",0,2022-05-17T11:23:38Z

제주 귀덕골방에 손님이 신청해주신 음악입니다.

음악은 추억이 아닐까요
누군가에 신청곡으로 첨 듣는 음악을 듣게 되고
어디선가 그음악을 또 듣게 되면
아! 골방에서 들었던 그노래

이런 추억을 다른이에게도 만들어주셨내요

누군가 듣고싶어 신청해주신 이노래를
만들어주신 작사,작곡, 편곡자분들과 불러주신 가수분에게 
정말 감사합니다.


제댓글이 많아 불편하셨다면 정말 죄송합니다.

하지만 제 댓글이 많다는건
이노래를 신청해주신 분들이 많다는거에요

그시간에 신청해주신 분이 이댓글을 보신다면
행복해 하실꺼라는걸 알거든요

그래서 신청곡이 들어올때마다 댓글을 남겨드리고 있어요

그시간에 소중한 신청곡 정말 감사합니다.

골방을 하면서 정말 모르고 있던
좋은 음악들을 많이 듣게되어 행복합니다.

@k-dragon3153,His covers sound like SM. (still amazing) It'd be great if he took vocal lessons outside the company. Finding a song  (r&B? rock ballad?) that suites the fragility of his voice is clutch. i feel like he could do a Kang Seungyoon and come back and slay KOMS once he learns how to tell a story and is comfortable revealing his own hardships in his singing,1,2022-02-14T02:40:13Z

@hannahdy9697,"Hello, let me introduce NCT's main vocalist Doyoung to everyone here :)

The talented and amazing singer that he is:
1. His performance on King of Masked Singers https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLptT-Koxq1ra3xWixuVjlgijHQZKJW4VC

2. All his OSTs, solo song, collabs, covers, stations, special projects, vocal compilation and pre-debut performances https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO_Bn7ySaxWstBnlgiGKYXPmbk10taX1T

3. Fancams https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcKTuMwiBpH0DEEAESzfSD2qWYqr6DU26 

For a glimpse of how amazing he is as a person and how passionate and dedicated he is as a singer you can watch these videos:
1. Short compilation of his personality. For newer ones you can look up for his fan accounts on Twitter https://youtu.be/a5gasT-haGc 
 
2. He prepared these KoMS stages while he was busy with tours, comebacks and flying in and out of the country https://youtu.be/bGLYLQDazjo

Doyoung also debuted as an actor with a short drama called Cafe Midnight (심야카페) Season 3 'The Curious Stalker' last year. Check out the trailer here: https://youtu.be/giEF7Rbg6yo 

Later on, he made his first appearance as musical actor in the musical Marie Antoinette and received great praises from seniors of the industry as well as the audiences.

His Instagram: instagram.com/do0_nct

He is the first ever K-pop artist that I fully stan starting 2017 although I've been listening to K-pop music way longer than that. He is not only an amazing artist but also has beautiful heart and always does his absolute best to connect with his fans. I hope this short introduction will interest any of you to check him further. Please give this gem a lot of love and support! ❤️",8,2022-01-13T03:20:37Z

@rain8854,i'm a long time fan of 1D especially Harry too! I loved the way Doyoung sang Falling. You can see and hear he brought his own color to this song. I love his vocals and his voice is pure heaven. There is something unique in his voice and made Falling 10 times painful to be honest. I am so proud. Doyoung did well.  Best cover ever!!!,59,2021-12-22T07:03:30Z

And you're not here
And there's no one to blame
But the drink in my wandering hands

Forget what I said
It's not what I meant
And I can't take it back
I can't unpack the baggage you left

What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling

You said you care
And you missed me too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you
And the coffee's out
At the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say

What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling

And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again

What am I now? What am I now?
What if you're someone I just want around
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?

@marygraceclare,"Today, I listened to this song once again to compare his cover to Jungkook's and as I listened to both of them, I realized that I like Doyoung's cover more than Jungkook's.  Because his voice is more calm and more soft than Jungkook's. I love how soft Doyoung's voice while singing this song. But do not judge me based on my opinion because I love both of them, I support both of them. This is just my opinion. Like this commentary if you have the same thought as mine. 👍 spread love not hate",65,2021-10-28T17:05:11Z
@yasminout,"SM has the best vocalists, this is way better preformed you can hear the sorrow in his voice. Don't get me wrong, the new cover by jk was good but I can't feel emotion on his, Doyoung made me tear up.

Falling-
I'm in my bed
And you're not here
And there's no one to blame
But the drink in my wandering hands

Forget what I said
It's not what I meant
And I can't take it back
I can't unpack the baggage you left

What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling

You said you care
And you missed me too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you
And the coffee's out
At the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say

What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling

And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again

What am I now? What am I now?
What if you're someone I just want around
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?

@sunseek3r,"i heard the original song exactly the moment it came out, falling is a song that'll always be special to me, i saw this cover like 2 months ago and honestly the only thing that came to my mind was, wow this guy's got talent. Always wanted to get into nct since like 2019 but didn't really get the chance, after listening to this cover i actually went and searched for every content related to doyoung and then slowly nct127, dream, wayv and so on, and now I'm back here as a baby nctzen, always will be one of my comfort vids, thank you doyoung for helping me get into nct and giving me so muchh happiness. ❤",45,2021-07-25T14:48:04Z

And you're not here
And there's no one to blame
But the drink in my wandering hands
Forget what I said
It's not what I meant
And I can't take it back
I can't unpack the baggage you left
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?

What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?

You said you care
And you missed me too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you
And the coffee's out
At the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?

@kmythebunny7886,"*sobs in old NCTzen that saw NCT grow trough SMRookies and is still here for them after 7 years* I'm happy to see them now.. They should be more noticed but one day it will come, I mean, who wouldn't flex to say they staned a group called NCT when they're 50.. They have amazing vocals and rappers passing by amazing dancing skills and good humour.. I wish people would see how much all (unofficialy) 23 members are talended and passionate by their job.. They give so much love and work so hard and still NCTzen aren't that many now but I'm sure they will perform in the 'Stade de France' and have to do 2 days of concert there.. NCT is here for me when no one is and I'll be there for them when they need me..

You said you care
And you missed me too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you
And the coffee's out
At the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say

What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?

When that special someone already moved on (or so you think),
but you're still attached to him/her.
You want to feel needed by that person, but no, he/she doesn't need you anymore.
If he/she needs the same comfort, love, he/she would want it from other person, not from you.",0,2021-04-06T22:02:38Z

And you're not here

Forget what i said
It's not what i meant
And i can't take it back
I can't unpack the baggage you left

What am i now
What am i now
What if I'm someone i don't want around
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if i down ?
What if i out ?
What if I'm someone you wan't talk about
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling

And there no one the blame but the drink and my wandering hands
Forget what I said, it's not what I meant

What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?

And you're not here
And there's no one to blame
But the drink in my wandering hands

Forget what I said
It's not what I meant
And I can't take it back
I can't unpack the baggage you left

What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling

You said you care
And you missed me too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you
And the coffee's out
At the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say

What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling

And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again

What am I now? What am I now?
What if you're someone I just want around
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?

@aishwariyadebnath1624,Honestly his voice is so good. His voice is smooth but isn't conventionally smooth. Like husky smooth. And I think that huskiness elevates his tone and emphasizes those feelings he's putting in through the song. Great cover Doyoung,4,2021-03-24T07:47:41Z

I'm in my bed
And you're not here
And there's no one to blame
But the drink in my wandering hands

Forget what I said
It's not what I meant
And I can't take it back
I can't unpack the baggage you left

What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling

And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again

What am I now? What am I now?
What if you're someone I just want around
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling",503,2021-03-24T03:22:17Z

@monicachyrs7975,"Lyrics

I'm in my bed
And you're not here
And there's no one to blame
But the drink in my wandering hands
Forget what I said
It's not what I meant
And I can't take it back
I can't unpack the baggage you left
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
You said you care
And you missed me too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you
And the coffee's out
At the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again
What am I now? What am I now?
What if you're someone I just want around
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling",24,2021-03-24T00:16:00Z

@김소현-k5u,"I'm in my bed
 And you're not here
 And there's no one to blame but the drink and my wandering hands

 Forget what I said
 It's not what I meant
 And I can't take it back
 I can't unpack the baggage you left

 What am I now?
 What am I now?
 What if I'm someone I don't want around?
 I'm falling again
 I'm falling again
 I'm falling

 What if I'm down?
 What if I'm out?
 What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
 I'm falling again
 I'm falling again
 I'm falling

 You said you cared
 And you missed me too
 And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you

 And the coffee's out
 At the Beachwood Cafe
 And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say

 What am I now?
 What am I now?
 What if I'm someone I don't want around?
 I'm falling again
 I'm falling again
 I'm falling

 What if I'm down?
 What if I'm out?
 What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
 I'm falling again
 I'm falling again
 I'm falling

 And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again

 What am I now?
 What am I now?
 What if you're someone I just want around?
 I'm falling again
 I'm falling again
 I'm falling

 What if I'm down?
 What if I'm out?
 What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
 I'm falling again
 I'm falling again
 I'm falling",7,2021-03-23T12:18:05Z

And you're not here
And there's no one to blame

Forget what I said

I can't unpack the baggage you left

You said you care
And you missed me too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you
And the coffee's out
At the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?

What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?

Nobody lose their minds I was just kidding. Baekhyun is the one that got me into kpop with his amazing vocals so he’ll always be my #1 but DoYoung is climbing that list extremely fast. His voice is so pure.

Lyric Falling - Harry Styles

I'm in my bed
And you're not here
And there's no one to blame
But the drink in my wandering hands

Forget what I said
It's not what I meant
And I can't take it back
I can't unpack the baggage you left

What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling

And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again

What am I now? What am I now?
What if you're someone I just want around
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling",560,2021-03-23T06:12:06Z

@andrea5461,"I don't know if criticism is accepted here and this is nothing against Doyoung personally. He has a very strong but soothing voice, but the breath control here is not great. It's quite breathy. Maybe it's his style but personally it bothered me. A lot of consonants sound too harsh which means you can hear the puffs of air as he pushes through them. Also, when he sings, ""what am I now? what am I now?"", he changes volumes, going for a much softer sound at the end, but you you can hear the air he's not using kinda flowing into the microphone? Might be intentional but I doubt it. He might be an amazing singer but I do think this cover needed a bit more rehearsing.",0,2021-03-23T04:58:22Z

@stefany6272,"I'm in my bed
And you're not here
And there's no one to blame
But the drink in my wandering hands

Forget what I said
It's not what I meant
And I can't take it back
I can't unpack the baggage you left

What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling

You said you care
And you missed me too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you
And the coffee's out
At the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say

What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling

And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again",101,2021-03-23T02:53:37Z

Harry: he’s like done being in pain and telling the world that he’s falling down, showing that he’s vulnerable and hurting after he lost his lover. It’s like he’s crying for help because the pain is unbearable.

Doyoung: he’s crumbling down after he lost his lover but acts fine, suppressing his emotions so no one would know. he’s falling after he lost his lover but acts fine, suppressing his emotions so no one would know. It’s a burden that he chose to keep himself.",164,2021-03-23T01:51:28Z

@culturetechs,"I don't usually prefer ballads or songs with slower tempos, but Doyoung has successfully lured me in. His delivery is always top-notch -- regardless if it's in the recording booth, at a live concert, or in a cover like this. He doesn't sing for the sake of ~showing emotion~ or making it sound like he's going through his 3rd divorce. He sings with emotions because that's what he does best -- telling stories through his singing. His voice is equally soothing and comforting as it is powerful and compelling. He makes you want to listen to him. He's right. Everytime he sings I just keep falling and falling again.",205,2021-03-22T16:54:06Z

@thaimanic5880,"Bruh he sings like hes  home from the wedding of his first lover, his just mom died, his current lover just broke up with him, his dog died, he got in a street fight and his friends are now disappointed in him and don’t talk to him, his sister has a bf now and he’s sad to watch her grow up, and he’s singing this at the doctors office waiting to see if the street fight broke any bones, finds out he broke his neck, walks home, trips on a rock and starts crying because he just can’t take it anymore, curls up into a ball on the side of the road so very sad. Once he gets up and goes home with food for his mom, he remembers what happened, he cries himself to sleep. The end.",2682,2021-03-22T16:38:16Z

@imirayuu,"I'm in my bed
And you're not here
And there's no one to blame
But the drink in my wandering hands
Forget what I said
It's not what I meant
And I can't take it back
I can't unpack the baggage you left
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
You said you care
And you missed me too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you
And the coffee's out
At the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again
What am I now? What am I now?
What if you're someone I just want around
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?

@kholifah3991,"Lyrics

I'm in my bed
And you're not here
And there's no one to blame
But the drink in my wandering hands
Forget what I said
It's not what I meant
And I can't take it back
I can't unpack the baggage you left
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
You said you care
And you missed me too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you
And the coffee's out
At the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again
What am I now? What am I now?
What if you're someone I just want around
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling",80,2021-03-22T15:28:28Z

@콩-f3f,"I'm in my bed and you're not here

난 침대에 있고 넌 여기에 없지

​

And there's no one to blame 

탓할 사람은 없어

but the drink and my wandering hands

술과 갈곳 잃은 내 손뿐

​

Forget what I said 

내가 한말은 잊어줘

​

It's not what I meant

진심이 아니었어

​

And I can't take it back 

다시 되돌릴 수는 없겠지

​

I can't unpack the baggage you left

네가 남기고 간 짐도 풀지 못했어

​

What am I now?

What am I now?

난 이제 뭐지?

​

What if I'm someone I don't want around?

나 조차도 곁에 있고 싶지 않은 사람이면 어쩌지?

​

I'm falling again 

나는 다시 무너져

I'm falling again 

난 다시 가라앉고 있어

I'm falling 

​

What if I'm down?

만약 내가 지쳐버리면?

​

What if I'm out?

만약 내가 포기해 버린다면?

​

What if I'm someone you won't talk about?

만약 네가 말하기조차 싫은 사람이면 어쩌지?

​

I'm falling again 

I'm falling again 

I'm falling 

​

You said you cared

나를 아낀다고 했잖아

And you missed me too

너도 내가 보고싶었다고 했잖아

​

And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you 

나도 잘 알아 너에 관해 너무 많은 노래를 쓴다는걸

​

And the coffee's out at the beachwood cafe

비치우드 카페에서 커피는 다 떨어져가고

​

And it kills me 'cause I know we've ran out of things we can say

우리가 나눌 대화가 더이상 없다는게 날 미치게 해

​

What am I now?

What am I now?

난 이제 뭐지?

​

What if I'm someone I don't want around?

나 조차도 곁에 있고 싶지 않은 사람이면 어쩌지?

​

I'm falling again 

I'm falling again 

I'm falling 

​

What if I'm down?

만약 내가 지쳐 버린다면?

What if I'm out?

만약 내가 포기해 버린다면?

​

What if I'm someone you won't talk about?

네가 말조차 하기 싫은 사람이면 어쩌지?

​

I'm falling again 

I'm falling again 

I'm falling 

​

And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again 

네가 날 다시 원하지 않을거란걸 느껴

​

What am I now?

What am I now?

난 이제 뭐지?

​

What if you're someone I just want around?

내가 원하는 사람이 그저 너뿐이라면?

​

I'm falling again 

I'm falling again 

I'm falling 

​

What if I'm down?

What if I'm out?

​

What if I'm someone you won't talk about?

​

I'm falling again 

I'm falling again 

I'm falling",0,2021-03-22T14:54:02Z

@챌챌-f5c,도랏네...도영이 폴링 .... 삶의 이유를 찾았다•••,0,2021-03-22T14:08:19Z
@ddovelylee3947,"도영아.... 갈수록 실력이 더 느는 게 보여서 팬으로서 너무 뿌듯하고 고맙고ㅠㅠ 
팬들이 좋아했던 것 같아서 다시 제대로 불러봤다는.. 그 예쁜 마음 어떻게 갚아줄 수 있을까.. 

너가 노래를 사랑하는 모습이 그 어떤 가수보다 강하게 와 닿아서 항상 알면서도 많이 놀라고 감동받고 그래..
북미투어 때도  스스로 계획해서 그 낯선땅에서 버스킹영상 찍어 올린 것부터 상당히 큰 충격줬었는데 갈수록 여기저기서 최대한 활용할 수 있는 많은 것들을 이용해 노래를 들려주고 진심을 전해주려 해서 감동 받고 또 받고.. 익숙해지지 않는 감동이야ㅠㅠ

븨앱을 켜도, 라방을 켜도 항상 노래는 꼭 불러주는.. 콘서트까지도 열어주는 기특한 멤버.. 
언젠가 복면가왕에서 아이돌이라는 것에 자부심이 있다고 했는데 그 자신감, 자부심이 너를 발전시키고, 더 큰 사람으로 성장시키는 것 같아서.. 이런 아이돌의 팬이라 벅차고 뿌듯해!
너는, 엔시티 멤버들은 언제나 성장하고 발전하고 있는 게 보이니까 항상 자신감 잃지 말고 더더 오래오래 팬들한테 노래 불러줄 수 있는 가수가 되어줘! 
오랜만에 올라온 커버영상에 너무 벅차서 너무 주저리주저리..그래도 이것도 다 표현 못하고 줄인거야ㅠㅠ 

김도영 장하다. 자랑스럽다! 엔시티 더 성공하자!",0,2021-03-22T14:08:17Z

@user-zg7cr6pb2l,"Doyoung’s voice srsly heals my empty soul... nowadays we might feel empty, tiring, depressed or unhappy and the world rn might be a whole chaos (eg. Covid pandemic, cruel ppl disrespecting/mistreating one other, racism, unfair treatment, betrayal, situation that causes mental health problems (depression or anxiety)) 
But I’m really glad that besides all these negative things...they are still angels that save our life and make our life better...(Words can’t describe how grateful I am that I have Nct in my life.. I’m really thankful for the existence of nct... they made our life better... they make me find more hope and meaning in life...sometimes I think the world is so cruel and that life is pointless/hopeless... but Nct is the one that given me strength... they gave me strength to continue to live a life despite of all the negatives. Everytime I hear their voices and their songs it completely heals my soul... the moment I hear their voices it’s like suddenly all the worries, negative things are all gone... oso it’s makes me think that the world aren’t that bad after all and that there are always meaning in life.... it is like a free therapy for me... they are really an inspiration to me... from the bottom of my heart Im rlly rlly thankful to nct for appearing in my life (thank you so so much and luv u guys forever💚💚💚) 
I strongly believe that Nct deserve more and they deserve the whole world... their talents, personalities, kindness should get more recognition like for real...they are the number one💯🥇 (their vocals, dances, raps, visuals are undefeatable) 
Nct World Domination🌍💚💚💚⭐️⭐️⭐️
I hope all nct, nctzens and even non nctzens are doing well at life whilst the pandemic... 
Let’s stay together forever... we are one family and the greatest fandom  “Nctzen” 💚💚⭐️⭐️ 
(Sorry for my bad English haha lol) 
Anyways have a great one everyone... u guys are all amazing and all did well today ...yoshi yoshi everyone 💚💚💚⭐️⭐️⭐️

@mochideceased42,"this cover showcases the different beautiful vocal colours of doyoung. we have the soft colour we usually see and are familiar with in dy's parts in nct songs(0:15). we can see the amazing vocal control in the chorus(0:48), and we see the weak, beautiful, desperate colour(1:49). we also have the strong, aggressive, eager voice in the end(2:10).
this cover again reminds me of how good of a vocalist dy is. definitely deserved all the parts in nct's songs. might be one of the leading vocalists in 4th gen in the future. (just like his idol baek in 3rd gen!!) looking forward to more!",17,2021-03-22T13:48:57Z

Song by Harry Styles

Lyrics
I'm in my bed
And you're not here
And there's no one to blame
But the drink in my wandering hands
Forget what I said
It's not what I meant
And I can't take it back
I can't unpack the baggage you left
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
You said you care
And you missed me too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you
And the coffee's out
At the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again
What am I now? What am I now?
What if you're someone I just want around
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling
What if I'm down?
What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm falling.",73,2021-03-22T13:28:27Z

I can't unpack the baggage you left

Beautiful voice, calming music, feels, expressions, emotions, all of it. And when he sings.. I relate to the songs and the lyrics. IDK HOW TO EXPLAIN IT WITH WORDS, but his voice is like magic. No matter who you are, where you are, when youre listening to it, you cant help but be impressed with his voice. An angel. Doyoung is not underrated, he has a lot of fans, but I just want ppl to keep sending him love cuz he is such a genuine and loving person. I just wrote a speech.",0,2021-03-22T13:20:09Z

@alanasparrow4451,"I'm not a harry styles fan but I connected with falling when it was released.
Doyoung is one of my fav, if not my fav vocalist in the industry.
Hearing him sing falling brought me to tears as I could feel the emotion in Doyoung's voice, he understood the songs dynamic and he showed it. Falling is one of those songs that always has a memory or a moment attached to it to make you love it, to make you connect with it, to make you feel it. hearing Doyoung sing made me wonder how he connected and it made me sad to think that he might connect to it in the same way others do, with a sad moment or memory. Songs like this however even though connected to sad feelings bring comfort in knowing others feel the same, so to anyone seeking comfort I hope you found it through Falling and through our angle Doyoung.

P.S. Doyoung may not have connected but may have just been able to portray the emotion in his voice.",1,2021-03-22T13:17:41Z

@태어났더니핑크블러드,"김도영 미친거 아닌가 진짜!! 비속어 왕창 쓰면서 감정을 격하게 표현하고 싶은데 도영이 영상에 예쁜 말만 쓰고 싶어서 참아볼께....
예고해줬을 때 저번 븨앱에서 부른 블루밍이나 백현 슨배님 노래 기대하긴 했는데 영상 보는 순간 걍 이거 불러줘서 고맙다고 절하고 싶은 마음 뿐.  올해 시작한지 3개월밖에 되지 않았는데 밤공기, 인형, 커버곡, 븨앱 도콘 .. 이미 수많은 노랠 들려줌ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
노래 사랑하고 진심으로 불러주고 팬들한테 항상 들려주고 싶어해서 너무 고마워 김도영!! 
아이돌로, 가수로, 도영으로 오래오래 노래해줘ㅠㅠ",2,2021-03-22T13:12:09Z
