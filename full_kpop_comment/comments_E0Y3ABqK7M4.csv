@indrimirdayani8277,"aku hanya ingin berterima kasih kepada sang kholik telah mempertemukan kita berdua, berterima ksih kepada sang pemilik matahari telah mengiringi cinta kita diwaktu terik, berterima kasih kepada sang pemilik malam karna menyertai kita untuk melepaskan segenap rindu dan sayang sampai pagi membangunkan kita, untuk menjalani kisah baru hubungan kita yaitu perpisahan entah sampai berapa lama. dan ketika bertemu nanti ada cinta yg lebih besar  yg kita bawa.",0,2020-10-08T07:42:16Z
@indrimirdayani8277,"aku ingat saat2 kita ingin berpisah kau sekolah di pasui,  waktu itu kau tinggal di belalang kita bertemu dan langsung saja kau ingin beli rumah di bangkan untuk kita tinggali, kau tidak suka tinggal di makassar karna cuacanya terlalu panas. waktu itu yg terpikir hanya bagaimana nasib study kita nanti,  lalu kau tak terima alasan apapun, marah besar lalu entah kau pergi kejepang atau korea mencari tempat yg lebih dingin.",0,2020-10-08T07:27:55Z
@indrimirdayani8277,"aku ingat cintaku betapa panik kau ketika beberapa menit saja aku terlambat pulang kerumah kau memelukku sambil menangis seakan kau tak ingn kehilangan aku walau sedetkpun, kau sangat takut kalau sesuatu yg buruk menimpaku, yg kau tau hanya aku selalu berada disisimu tidak keluyuran kemana2  sampai kau berkata lebih baik kita berdua di butakan saja matanya biar tidak kemana2,tidak memperhatikan hal lainnya memperhatikan dan memikirkanmu saja.",0,2020-10-08T07:10:54Z

@me_hanics,"I still am mad at her for how she, Taeyeon and Seohyun treated Jessica.

To me Jessica probably just wanted everyone in the group to be a giving member to the group and be equal (not stand out) buy Tiffany has been saying she'll be a solo since Day1 and that must have annoyed Jess who probably had some words for her. And therefore that's how they became distant, with Taeyeon and Seohyun backing Tiffany

Also is really noone feeling how her leaving SNSD and especially SM for nothing is just selfish? If you really ""want to be a solo"" from day1, then be a solo and not debut in a band that you only debut in to start your career. She only used SNSD to gain fame. And imagine how devastated SM must have been, literally giving her everything, even care of her more than Taeyeon and she just leaves",2,2019-12-31T01:42:40Z

@ensar4278,"May Allah's, His Messengers, His beloved ones greetings and blessings be upon you. 

How To Perform the Uwaysi / Uways Al-Qarani (Veysel Karane) Dhikr

Preparation:

1-   Get into a silent, peaceful mood before start performing the Dhikr (not loudly, as much as you could hear your own voice).   

2-   Better to be alone ideally (when possible).    

3-   You have to be in a well-mannered and polite mood, without forgetting in whose presence you are before. 

4-    You should have performed your ablution (wudu) earlier.

5-     There is no spesific time period to perform the dhikr, you can start your dhikr whenever you feel most ready to make it and feel most available within the day. 

6-     However, ideally the best times to make the Uwaysi dhikr are either before and after the Morning Salat, and before you go to sleep at nights. Dhikr must be performed twice a day: first in the light of the morning, this means you can make it at any time during the day, and then secondly at the darkness of the night and so that means in the evening or night times. Allah says: “While everyone is in sleep; my servant mentioned Me as well as my Messenger in the absence of the others” thus Allah will love the Dhikr performer a lot. 

Performing the Dhikr: 

1-  Before you start doing your dikhr, initially recite Basmala : “B-ismi-llahi r-rahmani r-rahim” and then you must first say: ''Tawba Astaghfirullah'' for 100 times repeatedly (alternatively you can say ‘Astaghfirullah El Azim’ too).    
 
2-      Then without saying any ‘Basmala’, we send Salawats to our beloved Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) at least for 100 times. So you will say; “Allahumme Salli Ala Seyyidina Muhammed”, or another salawat of your choice, at least for 100 times or more than 100 repeatedly. There is no limit in the numbers of Salawats. If you would ask us, we would advice to say it minimum for 100 times. However for those who would like to make it, we can also advice for 132 though this is not essential. If you would ask why 132, please then refer to our book, Love of Uwaysi-1.

3-      Once you finish saying Salawats, you must then read -11- Surah Al-Ikhlas and -1- Surah Al-Fatihah only, these numbers are precise.  

4-   Gift Section:
And then send the Salawats and Surahs that you read as a gift to: “My glorious Allah, I would like to give the rewards of the Surahs and Salawats that I have read to; our beloved Prophet Mohammad’s (pbuh) mubarak soul, his Ahl al-Bayt, his friends and companions, his high family, to all righteous servants, to Al-Khidr (as) and the derwishes (saints) that he loves, to the helping sultans, and to hodjas (teachers) teaching us and to their hodjas, and to all Uwaysis, as a gift. Amen. Note that, you can also include your own relatives, friends, actually anyone that you love at the final part of the gift.  

5-      Tawhid:
Finally, Say Auzu Basmala for once (A'uzu billahi minashaitanir rajim Bismillahi rahmani Rahim), and then you must recite Tawhid, so say; “La Ilahe Illallah”repeatedly at least minimum for 100 times, or more.  

**Please also note that, 11 Ikhlas and 1 Fatihah shall not be read once after completing the dhikr.**

@jo769,"Tiffany whenever you go, SONES will always be there for you. Korea and the world doesn't deserve you. You are a hard working, a sincere and such a thoughtful person. You have such a great voice and wonderful personality. You are a strong girl too ❤️

We all know how humble and friendly you are.  Always the one bringing Soshi together and updating with us (Fans) about SNSD through your SNS. 

You gave me strength, hope and your cheerful bright smile always never fails to make me smile and brighten up my day. I love your character, your friendliness, your helpfulness, your always giving and understanding attitude.

This is precisely why you are my first idol, my ultimate bias since 2010 and will always be. You and SNSD are the ones that brought me to K-pop and if you are leaving, I am also leaving.  

And lastly, Tiffany. You are my inspiration, my aspiration, my motivation, my purpose, my morale support, my role model and my hope.
Loving and supporting you to the end of time since 2010 ❤️",193,2018-06-14T00:47:52Z

@ペムペム,Why im not sad too much when she left of SM (but i trust she just left that stupid company but never leave of SNSD<3) i think she can sing and make her career or show her dramas do everything she want and meet her family if she has freetime i think it's better than she was in SM very much eww how surprise~ cause SM always block everything she want to do seem likes seohyun and sooyoung,1,2018-05-10T02:41:26Z

This song is excellent and I'm sad she didn't get to explore her solo career through SM more. Her voice is so beautiful and unique and she has great technique too. 
I hope she continues to do well in the future. I'm not even a SONE but I'm so sad today because of this SNSD news.",464,2017-10-10T12:22:01Z

@Shiku82,"Hello, Miss Hwang. I just wanted to say what, I'm proud of you, being Fanytastic and SONE since I'm a little girl. I thank you for this album, for this video, for this song. I want to thank you for being the strong woman you've always been, an example to follow, a piece of diamond that no one can break. I really love the music you create, it relaxes me and takes me out of my stress and bad days. For us, the fans who know you and know how much you have put your love in this, really, for all of them I thank you. It continues, grows and shines. You are the person for that, because, God will protect you from all the hatred of the world, you, loving girl and with a smile.
Thank you for always protecting members, for protecting and encouraging Taeyeon. Really, you're an angel, just because you're golden inside, you shine on the outside.
Thank you for always treating your fans with love, even when you are tired and have been disrespectful to you, turned against you and have spoken words of hate. I, all the Fanytastics around the world are proud of you, because, you have done the right thing and we trust that you will continue doing it. We will be with you in the good and the bad, I will pray for your well-being every day, because we love you, I love you, and you have made us happy for a long time. You are a person dedicated to your work and from YouTube, instagram, Twitter, whatever it is. We will give you support, because we are a family and we call ourselves SONE.
Now, forever and ever. We love you, Tiffany. Thank you very much for your album, for your smile, for being.
God bless you, babe.",3,2017-08-17T21:14:07Z

@nhatha4899,"HOW TO STREAM IN RIGHT WAY #200MIGAB #200MGEE #200MTHEBOYS #10YEARSANNIVERSARY
With COMPUTER:
+ Opening this MV just in ONE TAP of MANY WEB BROWSERS (Google chrome, firefox, internet explorer, Opera,... ). You can also open more tabs with different MV. 
+ Searching on youtube and watching from start to the end ( no skip, pause or replay + quality 720HD or more + volume at least 50% ). 
+ Log in your account to like and comment and remember LOG OUT before watching because even if you watched thousand times Youtube just count it 1 view only.
+ After watching for more 10 times, CLEAR WEB HISTORY.
With SMARTPHONE OR IPAD:
Don't use Youtube app, watching in web browsers and do steps like above.",4,2017-05-16T16:25:09Z

@luvu7195,"며칠째 내린 비가 그친 밤
I feel good 
젖은 거리 위로 비친 조명

한편의 쇼가 끝난 후에 
텅 빈 무대 같은 도시
It’s alright It’s alright
젖은 공기 속으로 
날 비추는 가로등
좋아 내 몸이 움직여

I just wanna 
dance the night away
두 눈을 감고 
dance in the moonlight
점점 더 달아올라 뜨겁게
나도 날 멈출 수 없어 No way

I just wanna 
dance the night away
dance the night away
I just wanna 
dance the night away
dance the night away
I just wanna 

아주 슬픈 영화에 취한 것 보다
지금 난 더 헝클어지고 
싶을 뿐이야 

헤드라이트 불빛은 마치 
도로 위 춤추는 리듬 
It’s alright It’s alright
빈틈 없이 채워진 빌딩은 
마치 객석 같아 
준비는 다 됐어

I just wanna 
dance the night away
두 눈을 감고 
dance in the moonlight
점점 더 달아올라 뜨겁게
나도 날 멈출 수 없어 No way

I just wanna 
dance the night away
dance the night away
I just wanna 
dance the night away
dance the night away
I just wanna 

하루하루 바꿔 쓰는 
가면들 속에 나를 숨겼어
지금 난 더 솔직해지고 
싶은 것뿐이야

I just wanna
dance the night away
나의 도시가 만든 beat 속에
점점 더 빠져들어 더 깊게
이 순간에 난 진짜 날 느껴

I just wanna 
dance the night away
dance the night away
I just wanna 
dance the night away
dance the night away

@llseeinnm603,"I'm pretty fed up with this whole ""scandal"". Tiffany is American, born in San Francisco, raised in LA. She was born 44 years after the end of WW-II, but only 2 years after the end of the Park and Chung dictatorships. That 15 year period of Korean history was marked by the brutal suppression of demonstrators, including mass shootings of students, and the imprisonment and disappearance of thousands of political opponents. Koreans seriously need to reflect on their own history, before they condemn an American citizen who has been one of the strongest supporters and proponent of Korean culture. Makes on wonder if there is such an ideological difference between North and South!",1,2016-10-07T17:54:50Z

@부승현-x8k,"I'm really surprised that some people think the Japan's war flag as a symbol of Japan. The flag is a symbol of violence, cruelty, and war. it doesn't mean nothing more than that. I understand that foreigners do not know a lot about Korea and Japan's history, but it is sure that Japanese did so much cruel things to Koreans and also to Chinese. Knowing that the flag is a symbol of Japanese colonial era is so basic as a Korean. We should never forget our ancestors' sacrifice. Tiffany made all the Koreans angry and tragic in the independence day which is a day to remember our ancestors. even though if it was not the important day, the problem would be the same. I also know that Tiffany didn't mean to hurt all the Korean's mind. It was a mistake. But this event was showing that she is a stupid ignorant who doesn't know anything about the history. Beacause of her action lots of people got embarrased and angry and it will not be the easy problem to get through. Also, Koreans are really sensitive about the history and Japan.

@nouhedg4035,"The first thing that crossed my mind after seeing what she posted was "" baby girl you fucked up real big this time "" , quite an unforgivable mistake considering the fact it was almost Independance day , with that said , such a mistake will get consequences and harsh criticism , totally acceptable ! Now moving to something else , being into the Korean culture for almost 12 years of my life and knowing the people and studying  the history pretty well although i'm neither Korean nor lived that past , i'd have to say , THEIR ANGER IS UNDERSTANDABLE and when i say "" THEIR "" i mean the PUBLIC CITIZENS OF SOUTH KOREA not KNETZ !! Knetz are well known for being harsh and cruel to everyone regardless of their position in  the industry , but what to do ??You can't fight them all right ? What matters is what the public thinks of her , and trust me Korea is like any other country , has GOOD and BAD people too , so to say  "" oh i no longer like Koreans for what they're doing to Tiffany "" is kinda wrong ! They're sensitive people , close-minded ( not in a bad way , as in more traditional and old school type of people ) believe the media whole heartedly , and they're still not used to the International wave they're getting the last few years because Kpop !!! Nice people though , most of them .......... THIS IS ALL OBJECTIVE ....... Now , enough talking about the good , let's talk about the bad side , Kpop industry is LITERALLY DEVILISH , as most of fans know ; how idols are trained ,  how they're treated , how they're supposed to  behave , a small mistake could lead to a major career loss !! The most irritating thing i hate about Koreans though ( bad ones , as in Knetz and their brothers ) despite all what idols go through the way they criticize them is something i cannot acept  , ""you did wrong , you're the worst person on earth and that's it "" no forgivness no nothing . They are the main reason behind every celebrity suicide and then they blame it on depression ....... i hope this whole issue die soon though before something bad happens to her !!!",1,2016-09-11T22:24:22Z

@youngmouxri,"I do really wanna ask y'all....do u guys even know about korean history under rule of the Japanese Empire during 1910~1945? A snapchat emoji that Tiff uploaded is the emoji colored with the flag of the Japanese Empire (also called ""Sunrise flag"" / widely used in WW2 and represented the Japanese Nationalism [currently used as the official flag of the Japanese Navy]). K-pop or Tiff fans must know this flag shares same concepts with Nazi flag in WW2. Therefore, the ""Sunrise flag"" is extremely hostile and hateful thing toward Koreans. I totally understand y'all feelings about this issue ; however, the mistake that Tiff had done is not acceptable because understanding the meaning of ""Sunrise flag"" is basic (extremely fundamental) knowledge for Koreans. Even though, she is a Korean-American; she stayed in Korea for several years. She must have known it a while ago. U guys know Snapchat emoji is the thing that we can choose so whether she intended do select it or not, she crossed beyond a tolerance line that Koreans can forgive.

@JohnKim-mk3fv,"I think many of you are getting this Tiffany's flag issue wrong.  Although she does not deserve death comments and what she did was a mistake, you need to understand the issue from a different perspective.  First of all, you cannot compare this issue with Tzuwu's flag incident, or GD's.  Expressing gratitude using the rising sun flag is a seriously hurtful act for all of Koreans.  Why so? Because of the following reasons:  Undeniably, all of this is in the past and Tiffany is not in the war-torn (who did not live through the war and seemingly has no idea about the modern East Asian history) but seemingly in a peaceful era where people get to communicate and appreciate other people's cultures.  It seems as if many things have worked out between South Korea and Japan, but there are still things lingering.  Consider a rapist and a victim.  Japan's army is the rapist (I know this sounds harsh but in reality, it was a lot more harsh than this - google if you want to find about the accurate East-Asian history) and you are the victim's grand child (Tiffany, Taeyeon, or all of Koreans).  After many years the rapist gets sentenced, fined, and made guilty by the judge (United Nation), he pleads guilty and everything seems to be ok.  However, after serving time and repent, the rapist makes outrageous statements saying the victim wanted to have sex and did so voluntarily totally debasing the victim and her family (In very recent years, Japan made official statements about Comfort women being volunteers, so the issue is not from war-torn 75 years ago).  The victim and her family get infuriated and demand justice from the K-police (Korean government).  K-police contacts J-police (Japanese government) and work out a shady deal without consulting the victim and her family (Japan pays Korea 1 billion yen or 8.3 million usd to clear this issue of comfort women in December of 2015, and the settlement funds still haven't reached the victims).  Now the J-police demands K-police to remove the rapist's criminal record (Japan demands the comfort women statue to be removed from the Japanese embassy in Seoul).  Since the shady deal, officially now the victim and her family cannot demand justice if the rapist happens to accuse her of volunteer sex (Korea cannot demand any kind of apologies after this deal).  Now the victim and her family are desperately reaching out to other people for what happened (Comfort women, not just Korean women, and their helpers are working hard to let people in the world know what happened.  THIS IS STILL HAPPENING.)  Second, Tiffany is a face that represents South Korea in entertainment industry.  As a representative of her country, she should have been more mindful of sensitive history issues and whatnot.  Although Tiffany's mistake seems to be a simple mistake and does not deserve death comments, because of all of these reasons, many Korean people feel Tiffany and the like (AOA members) need to be made an example of why celebrity or any person representing a country need to know their country's history.  One last thing to say: people harshly bashing Tiffany because of what she did please stfu.  A young girl made a mistake but she doesn't deserve to have her career gone over this.  People advocating Tiffany by bashing Korean people, please stfu.  You don't have an in-depth idea about why Korean people bashing Tiffany.  The best thing to say is put yourself in the rapist's victim shoes then you will understand Korean people.",3,2016-09-02T20:53:47Z

I like her as a person and personality so will give her solo stuff some more time to adjust to and hopefully a few of her songs will eventually stick and I'll like them, but maybe not.

@israelmatunan8742,"I really don't understand why k-netz are so angry over Tiffanys mistake. My country is also colonized by Japan. They've raped and violated our women. The Korean soldiers that they've brought with them also raped and violated our women, even more than the japanese did. They've killed and tortured our people. They've destroyed our homes, forcing our people to live in caves and forest just to hide from the japanese. They made our people live everyday of their lives in fear.They've made our country their battlefield against their war with America, thousands of our innocent people caught in the crossfire and destroying our major cities. What's worse is the Bataan death March where they've forced 75,000 of our people and american troops to walk 65miles going to prison camps without food, water and rest, while continually abusing them physically. 10000 of our people died in that march. Even my own grandmother experienced the terror brought by the japanese, they were forced to hide for days in holes they've dug up whenever japanese soldiers goes in their town. But despite everything that they've done in our country and in our people we don't hate the japanese, we don't give a fuck even if a citizen of our country, even if they are a celebrity, uses the japanese flag or the rising sun flag in their social media post. Why? Because it's all in the past already, it's all history. What's done is done, what's lost is lost. We should'nt dwell on the past and the past should'nt control the present. It's right to celebrate liberation day, to honor the dead and the victims, but it's wrong, really wrong, to torment a sweet little woman just because of a single unintentional mistake. It's not like she's a murderer or a drug pusher or a plunderer or a corrupt politician but they treat her like one. It's not like her mistake caused a death of someone. What can they possibly gain from tormenting her? Do they feel pleasure by watching her suffer? Do they enjoy destroying her life and hardwork just because of one mistake? She already admitted her mistake, apologize for it and repented for it, what else do they want? I believe that the act of tormenting her, badmouthing her, hurting her, destroying her life and career, treating her like an international criminal are far worse than the mistake that she had committed. K-netz are really the best at criticizing other people like they are perfect, like they are Gods, like they've never comitted mistakes in their life. I just hope that Tiffany will be ok after all of these craziness ends.",120,2016-08-27T09:46:21Z

I mean, all she did was post the flag to let her friends know where she was on that day. It just happen to be on Korea's Independence day. She was in no way dissing Korea. If these shallow minded people can't see that and insist on dragging her through the mud, then she should seriously contemplate whether to ever return. For them to do this after all she has given them over the past 9 years, they don't deserve to breathe the same air as her. Tiffany Fighting!",21,2016-08-25T22:23:06Z

@Kiirze,"About the issue. Well, sadly, her apology wasn't accepted at all. K-netz want more as they think it wasn't sincere enough. I do believe it was, she wrote it after a 2 hours flight at the airport surrounded by the members. I'd like everyone to not deny her sincerity. What is worse is that they believe that Tiffany is some japanese imperialist who hates Korea which doesn't make sense at all. I agree she made a mistake and should've been more careful. Not defending her actions but as a person. She already realized it, deleted the snap in two minutes after posting it and apologized afterwards. She knows it and we all know she didn't intend to offend anyone. So what I don't understand is how this honest mistake is UNFORGIVABLE. Like, she didn't kill someone or didn't say ""I support Japan."" Fuck Korea."" while she went there all by herself without her family and dedicated around 15 years of her life for that country. And k-netz comments are just beyond cruelty. They basically want her dead, mentioning her mother, be raped and kicked out of Korea. This is going too far right now and no human being deserves such treatment. Everyone makes mistakes. I can't imagine how she must feels right now. She's probably blaming herself, having the mindset that litterally a whole country is hating her for a careless mistake she didn't mean to do. This could easily lead to suicidal thoughts and I hope she's not reading these comments. As a fan, it's upsetting that all you can do is sitting there watching the media twisting facts, mocking her and waiting for miracles.
We're all hoping for better days now.﻿",117,2016-08-17T23:02:29Z

She is a very sensitive person and has probably been reduced to tears over this. She would never intentionally hurt others. Sorry the same can't be said for the other way around.

@faggotsmoker9588,"Here's my opinion. I think she should be criticized about being so incautious. She lived long enough in Korea to know about how Koreans feel about their colonial period in Japan, and as a celebrity on a national scale, she should've cared more about Koreans' political views. However, I don't detect any malice in her actions. She simply wanted to show her affection toward Japan after having a good time with Japanese fans in the concert. And after all, she's an American. It would be even more uncanny if she cared just as much about Korean history as regular Koreans did.
And it's such a shame that a lot of fellow Koreans can only express their patriotism through rejecting other non-patriots. She might not be a true-Korean, but I still think she should be allowed to work in Korea regularly like she should to do. I just think she should be more cognizant about herself. 
But of course, most people will just close their eyes and cover their ears....",38,2016-08-15T17:11:29Z

@jkevdavidson1,"I have recently been informed that Koreans HATE Americans, to the point 
that if an attractive lady is seen in public with an American she will 
be scorned harshly. Well well hows that for a kicker. How many Americans
 lost there lives for South Korea's FREEDOM and actually our Military is
 still the strongest protector of South Korea to this day.I wonder how 
long they would last if we pulled all support? We all know it would not 
take long for that crazy bastard from the north to start throwing bombs 
at them. I know there were bad things the soldiers did but damn to be 
told to say your Canadian. I would really like to discuss this further 
with a South Korean because I really love K-dramas and K-pop and I think
 the people are so beautiful and intelligent this really disturbs me 
greatly. They should have American appreciation day every f-ing week!",4,2016-07-28T07:11:46Z

@unicornsandicecream5713,"Okay lol this is gonna be long but I feel like I needed to put it out somewhere so...

Okay so I've been watching Jessica and Tiffany interactions when English comes up in interviews and in variety shows and things.... at first, even though Tiffany is my bias, I got extremely annoyed at her. I was like ""really, can't you see Jessica might want to add something here"" or ""you're not the only native English speaker fany~"" 

but then idk I guess I realized she doesn't do stuff like that on purpose. It seems like Fany is just naturally really talkative and bubbly and, as the kind of ""mother"" of the group, that she needs to take care of the other members if they don't know English very well. She'd be one of those friends that I'd really look up to. I'd be annoyed with sometimes, but I'd look up to her because she would know that I would be too shy to say something or not sure how to reply in interviews,etc. She would help me out and just be positive in situations that I doubt I could ever be positive in. 

.....and so thats where I kind of see Sica's possible perspective. I know shes kinda icy and cold at first, but actually a really sweet, talented person. Looking back on older videos, it seems like Sica was always a bit shy or kind of introverted. Don't get me wrong, she had times when she was having fun and being crazy... but for the most part shes on the shy-er side. And sometimes I forget they've both known each other for so long. I thought that maybe PART of why she was angry at SNSD members (because they kicked her out (?- we dont know anything for sure...)) would be because of years of Tiffany kind of overshadowing her, especially in some of the biggest opportunities they had in New York during The Boys era. but I just thought that maybe there was some hidden resentment or something. Like they really loved each other and were friends but had moments when they just didn't go well together and fought alot. Honestly, I don't know them so I have no idea. But thats just what I felt.

Now, though, its like I don't think that was it. I think Jessica never hated her for how she was because she knew it was just Fany's personality and that she had good intentions. In fact, I'm probably the one looking at some videos and then making some deep analysis when I've never known them personally lol... 
idk. I just feel like they were so close. Really. Like they were born in the same hospital, when to school together for most of their education, and then knew each other long before they were trainees, trained together, debut together...Some little interviews wouldn't torn something like that apart. And actually, neither would problems with fashion careers and whatever else. I guess what I'm saying is that I had doubts about their bond. I shouldn't have, but I did. And then after thinking it all through i was like. Dang, I don't really know them and we only see like half of their lives so who am I to be coming to negative conclusions. And from what we know about their relationship, its more likely that they are ACTUALLY really close to one another. Sisters. Somehow more than sisters. Like some deeper, stronger bond. And thats why it confuses me about why Jessica left and people believe that SNSD kicked her out?

I don't want to bring this topic up and have people get into arguements (if any1 ever reads this lol) but that just doesn't make sense to me?? especially because of all that stuff I just mentioned about tiffany and jessica. But idk.  I just wanted to bring up how I think that they are still friends. Really. Even now that they are both doing their own things. Jessica DID say she kept in contact with some SNSD members still..I'm betting one of them is Fany :) 

Either way, I will support both of them and all of Girl's Generation. Dang so sorry, this is like a freaking essay. Also, the fan wars and stuff going on in the comment section ugh, really?? can't we all just be loving and supportive. <3 <3",1,2016-07-08T12:37:46Z

Like if you look at Tayeon's new song Why, you can see its not as popular (view-wise) as I. This is because, like Tiffany's song, it more in SM's new style. Which most people seem to not like as much. At least K netizens...I think it would make more sense to compare Why and I Just Wanna Dance. Just saying.

That the comparison seems kind of unfair when they're different types of songs. Not sure what its called tho. Like with Free Somebody, The 7th Sense, Why, Starlight, Luck Ones, etc. But anyway I do love both Taeyeon and Tiffany and I think they're songs are lit <3

@단댬-d3p,"며칠째 내린 비가 그친 밤
I feel good 
젖은 거리 위로 비친 조명

한편의 쇼가 끝난 후에 
텅 빈 무대 같은 도시
It’s alright It’s alright
젖은 공기 속으로 
날 비추는 가로등
좋아 내 몸이 움직여

I just wanna 
dance the night away
두 눈을 감고 
dance in the moonlight
점점 더 달아올라 뜨겁게
나도 날 멈출 수 없어 No way

I just wanna 
dance the night away
dance the night away
I just wanna 
dance the night away
dance the night away
I just wanna 

아주 슬픈 영화에 취한 것 보다
지금 난 더 헝클어지고 
싶을 뿐이야 

헤드라이트 불빛은 마치 
도로 위 춤추는 리듬 
It’s alright It’s alright
빈틈 없이 채워진 빌딩은 
마치 객석 같아 
준비는 다 됐어

I just wanna 
dance the night away
두 눈을 감고 
dance in the moonlight
점점 더 달아올라 뜨겁게
나도 날 멈출 수 없어 No way

I just wanna 
dance the night away
dance the night away
I just wanna 
dance the night away
dance the night away
I just wanna 

하루하루 바꿔 쓰는 
가면들 속에 나를 숨겼어
지금 난 더 솔직해지고 
싶은 것뿐이야

I just wanna
dance the night away
나의 도시가 만든 beat 속에
점점 더 빠져들어 더 깊게
이 순간에 난 진짜 날 느껴

I just wanna 
dance the night away
dance the night away
I just wanna 
dance the night away
dance the night away
I just wanna",0,2016-07-01T12:58:33Z

@thelocter,"I Just Wanna Dance is one of the best Kpop albums of the last years and one of the best SM albums released in music quality,

I dear to say that IJWD album is even better than ""I"" album, 
The songs of the album are super catchy and good, there's no boring songs on this album and you can play it on repeat all day long. 

Tiffany's vocals are perfect!, she sounds super good and her live singing was 100% on point!

IJWD is killer!, the choreo is super cool and all the production was super simple and classy but at the same time perfect and fun.

Tiffany really really shocked me as a solo artist, she's following her own path and that's what i like from her the most.
she won't let SM to control her career or music.

And HeartBreak Hotel is such an amazing song, seriously this IJWD bonus track aka smstation song is super good.

Go for that American market i'll support you no matther what! :) GO TIFFANY, FIGHTING",314,2016-06-19T19:19:50Z

Sicas mao-dumb fandom was so bitchy & racist Sica tried to hide her poop followers & disowned them by making a new fandom from scratch LMAO Gold stars or some shit?

Sicas other MV's don't even have over 3mil, Fly ENG ver flopped, love me the same was boring & flopped and her fashion line flopped

Tiffanys HBH has only been out half the time as Love me the Same and has as many Views so WHO's fandom is there through thick & thin? WHO is a true supporter? Who is more successful?

Sica should have been smarter before she breed a fandom that pissed off HALF HER SUPPORTERS! Sicas MV would be nowhere without all those  SONES still supporting her bc they miss the old days.",17,2016-06-18T19:17:08Z

@minakpoper2964,"Stop comparing her to Jessica, they're too different.

They think SM gives a shit about Sicas debut? She can't even scratch SM, they were worried about EXO NOT Sica. They put EXO after Fany so they wouldn't clash & both could be successful. 

Don't compare A girl who always played it safe & never even tried to reach her full potential whenever she got a high note, while brave Fany who always tries to do better than before & belt amazing high notes! She's always stepping out of her comfort zone even if she knows she might fail.

Don't compare a girl who knows no hardship and was got fame due to her plastic visual Vs. a girl that left home with no family, no knowledge of the language & lost her mother but stood courageously on stage. 

Don't compare Hardworking Fany to that Lazy girl. Fany is the worst dancer? At least she tries! Not only did she have bigger vocal parts in SNSD but she always gave her dancing her all! 

Don't compare that girl that had things so easy in SNSD while Fany was faced most discrimination since day 1 for no reason (prob bc she's American and so many Koreans r damn racist, same with EXO!). 

Don't compare that selfish girl who never made an effort to be friendly to others or talk to others. But fany always smiles when even hen she's sad, always putting others feelings before herself.

Don't compare hardworking fany to a girl that abandoned SNSD. To a girl that valued her dumb ass  boyfriend, failure fashion line and herself over her sisters.",6,2016-06-18T18:49:57Z

@vasoishere,"I feel like comments on youtube are written by 13 years old girls that do not know what fucking business means. The fact there are people comparing Tiffany's video to Jessica's just shows how brainwashed some of us are.  

Except that is was OBVIOUSLY a publicity stunt from both companies there are people that takes sides like thinking THEY actually know shIt about both girls and ALSO THINKING THEY MATTER IN THE SITUATION. 

DUDE GO EAT OREOS OR SOMETHING.

You want to support Jessica? Good for you! You don't want to? Well, guess what... nobody fucking cares. 

And all this shit happening just proves that Kpop is not about the music.

The funniest thing is that there are some people in the comments analyzing the whole ""who is a true sone"" thingy. Honestly, at the end of the day none of the members will realize the difference if you are true sone or not, so what's the point? People do not notice individuals in a crowd, it makes such a small difference that it's not even possible to distinguish.

All the comments here are screaming about loving both. gotta love sica too, be nice to sica, don't bash sica.

Yet Jessica's MV is letting the hate rip on fany and not a single damn one of her fans are sticking up for fanny. they are so smitten.

I've been watching from the beginning & no one had a problem with everyone being disgustingly mean to Tiffany.
But some people finally realize this isn't right and tell Sica's fans to back the fuck up & you jump to defend sica?! wtf!?

Love both!? Support both!? R u saying that now just bc u realized u actually made sica look bad & now she's reaping the consequences of ur behavior?
Where was that ""love both, support both"" when Tiffany was being trashed?

The plain truth is that Jessica would be NOTHING with out SM & SNSD, no matter how much you hate them. She owes ALL her success to them. And if you're so hell bent on pushing SONEs away lets just see how far that gets you. We are the ones SUPPORTING you (or WAS)",4,2016-06-11T19:39:26Z

We were unstoppable because we stood United as a family against the haters and netizens, we used to fight tooth and nail for our girls. I'm so sick of all the fan wars, I'm tired of this.

I understand if you don't like this song but could you please stop hating and comparing it to other artists songs
If you don't appreciate this song
Then leave and just listen to the songs you love
No one is pushing you to be here

@kittylissiegirl9162,"Guys, I understand that some fans can be annoying on both ends. But its dumb to hate an artist's work just because you don't like the fandom. Both fandoms are acting childish and crazy. It's music. Music is meant to be enjoyed. You're taking the joy from it when you make it about fandoms. Fans are only meant to support, not destroy. Otherwise, they are meaningless. This is why I hate this ""bias"" and ""fandom"" culture people have started. Support the song you like, enjoy the music, and be done with it.",1,2016-06-05T08:01:49Z

@clara7046,"Seriously, Maomao? Honestly, I'm a fan of Jessica since Gee, as has always been the most I liked among them (not only because she's beautiful, but I liked the voice and personality), but this fandom made me angry. They're different genres of music, we can't compare. I liked the two albums, and I know that both endeavored to please us, the fans.
Seriously, SONE? Hate Jessica only because of fandom? For God's sake, stop it. You may not like us, Maomao, but can't blame Jessica for it. You were also very bad with her at times, but I don't hate Fany because of this.
We'll only support the two and make them feel loved by fans, ♥. I'm sure it's not nice to open your Instagram or read comments and find a tremendous fanwar. If you like more than one, who cares? It all depends on taste.

Please, give your opinion, say it isn't what you expected but please do not go around hindering the fact that it is trash to other people that like it!

Let's all work together to get both M/Vs at the top because Jessica is still an SNSD member at heart and i sure as hell know she misses her friends back in Girl's Generation.",9,2016-06-03T17:09:08Z

Bashers of this song only proves that Tiffany really succeed on her album that they even got intimated and jealous on how well this song is doing. I thank them for giving time to Tiffany that even they don't like her they still come here and give effort on reading and replying at the comments.

@Diasproo,"It's a sad time when people can't just sit there and appreciate music for what it is, instead they'd rather judge and compare and bring negativity and hate to the comments. Tiffany is Tiffany. Jessica is Jessica. They have their own styles and their own MV's. So why don't people just appreciate the artist on their own MV instead of comparing with the other. This is NOT what the girls would want. You don't have to love them both, but don't try and start a war by commenting such ugly things on either of their MV's. I'm sure the girls would be sad to see such things happening on their MV's. ",0,2016-06-02T14:02:50Z

If you don't like then good for you just don't compared Jessica and her. They both work their butt off to create a song for you guys to enjoy but, some stupid haters just want to hate, huh? Both songs are great. Now, everyone have their own opinions which I do not blame, but hating and comparing idols and their songs are just a dumbass things to do. Well, can't we just be honest here, that both are them is better than y'all haters??? At least they know how to sing and dance better than all the 'haters'.

Its a SM Station Single with Tiffany feat AOMG or simon d (korean rnb artist)

the  date of release is the day of SMSTATION releases. 10 of June fits perfect with her solo Concert ""Weekend"" opening day and HBH will only be available as digital single (just like taeyeon did with Rain)

Tiffany will act on her MV, it's a chill song and not a pop dance track.
it's more like R&B with the special touch of our queen Tiffany!
also, the single won't be promoted on TV Music Shows. 
But she will have fun and enjoy her very special weekend. !",16,2016-05-31T09:54:26Z

But if u prefer one song to another, do u need to say it? If u rilly dislike a song, just ignore it n dun comment! Neither of them deserves so many hate.

Instead you immature fans and haters pick on SNSD!!!  Beside you immature MaoMao fans are maybe just joining Jessica but you guys don't even know OT9.  They reason why in their debut they have a lowercase g it because it represents the number 9 means they were planning to be to9ether forever!!

29 Sept, i do remember that day and how my heart broke when my bias kicked out. Until now i still hope that someday, i will wake up in 30 sept 2014 and start the morning like there was nothing happen except my excitement for SOSHI next big concert ""TOKYO DOME"". but that impossible T,T it wasn't a dream, it's real that she is no longer part of Soshi... for SM.

and you know what the worst part?
hey!! it was during ""The Best"" Album. ARRGGHHH!!!, INDESTRUCTIBLE? DIVINE? what the hell happend exactly T,T

i become a SONE in 2008, i know Soshi because of Yoona and fall in love with Sica Voice (ITNW). after 5 years, exactly in 2013 i already prepare myself if someday, one or more members became inactive. i already prepare myself if someday, one or more my sister will meet their love and married. i already prepare my self if someone leave the group for good and the rest member will give a happy farewell. BUT i'm not ready at all if it's all about ""GROUP BREAKDOWN"".

""8 and 1 in my eyes, but always 9 as 1 in my heart"". i said it to myself, trying to forget and rejecting the fact. it's not easy guys. i cant choose ""SICA ONLY"", because without SOSHI i dont think i'll know and fall for her. and i cant choose ""SOSHI ONLY"" because without Jessica, i dont think i'll become a SONE. then what can i do? FINE, i'll support both of them.

FOR IMMATURE FANS : 
2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016? which year you became a fans? how much you know about SOSHI? how much time you spend for them? how much effort and love you have for them? think again!!! you are nothing if you compare yourself to me. at least i was with them when the world still BLACK for SOSHI. you dont know how we struggling to raise PINK ocean wave. you know nothing and now you said you are a true fans? hahaha, dont make me laughing. bro and sis, SOSHI and SONE is a Family, if you hate one of your family member then you must learn more and start asking yourself, ""is it right for a family to destroy their own family""?

FOR HATERS'FAKE FANS
THANK YOU SO MUCH for coming here. Just take my thanks because you deserve for it! why? whats the reason? HELL YEAH, you help us to increase the view. Once again, thanks for you effort in this past 9 years(almost). keep your spirit and dont forget to come here everyday. thanks guys!!!! we'll also wait you in the next MV.

DONT F*CK UP WITH MY 9 SISTERS or you will drowning in our Pink Ocean Wave, oh!!! one more  dont forget that now we also have a Golden Color in our family.

""no matter what happen in the future, once Soshi, then we will forever Soshi, even if we married and become an old lady"" (i didnt said it, the girls said it by themself)

@한두룹둡디룹,"며칠째 내린 비가 그친 밤
I feel good 
젖은 거리 위로 비친 조명

한편의 쇼가 끝난 후에 
텅 빈 무대 같은 도시
It’s alright It’s alright
젖은 공기 속으로 
날 비추는 가로등
좋아 내 몸이 움직여

I just wanna 
dance the night away
두 눈을 감고 
dance in the moonlight
점점 더 달아올라 뜨겁게
나도 날 멈출 수 없어 No way

I just wanna 
dance the night away
dance the night away
I just wanna 
dance the night away
dance the night away
I just wanna 

아주 슬픈 영화에 취한 것 보다
지금 난 더 헝클어지고 
싶을 뿐이야 

헤드라이트 불빛은 마치 
도로 위 춤추는 리듬 
It’s alright It’s alright
빈틈 없이 채워진 빌딩은 
마치 객석 같아 
준비는 다 됐어

I just wanna 
dance the night away
두 눈을 감고 
dance in the moonlight
점점 더 달아올라 뜨겁게
나도 날 멈출 수 없어 No way

I just wanna 
dance the night away
dance the night away
I just wanna 
dance the night away
dance the night away
I just wanna 

하루하루 바꿔 쓰는 
가면들 속에 나를 숨겼어
지금 난 더 솔직해지고 
싶은 것뿐이야

I just wanna
dance the night away
나의 도시가 만든 beat 속에
점점 더 빠져들어 더 깊게
이 순간에 난 진짜 날 느껴

I just wanna 
dance the night away
dance the night away
I just wanna 
dance the night away
dance the night away

So stop trying to be a smart alec (Jessica haters & Tiffany haters) and think that views are everything about their success for their solo. And to those who say Jessica was kicked out of SNSD and SM because of the girls, please read the articles again. It is none of their fault. It's Kim Young Min.

@wfberrychantillycake,"Okay to all those haters, please do everyone a favor and stfu. Jessica and Tiffany's music video are two COMPLETELY different things. They are each unique in their own different ways. There is no need to compare them. I love them both and I think they both did an AMAZING job. You don't need to go around comparing the number of views. Why all the hate? Jessica left S.M and is having a lot of success rn. I'm proud of her, but I'm proud of Tiffany as well. They were both close friends before Jessica left, and Jessica mentioned in one of her latest interviews that they still talk. Yet YOU STUPID HATERS are making it sound like they're freaking archenemies, which is complete B.S. So please if you''re just hear to hate, take your hands off of the keyboard and just scroll out of this video because we don't want to hear your pathetic comments,

This is STEPHANIE HWANG'S music video. If you don't like it because your bias is out of snsd - for that reason alone... Then, that just proves how immature you all are. It's like saying you don't have a brain to make your own decisions. Stop being a baby & accept that J is out of the group and that the person to be blamed is the fucking company not the artists. Ya think they have the power to kick her out and ya think they want her out? After all those years and hardships? Think again. You think hating tiffany will magically turn Jessica a fucking God?

@TreadstoneOperative,"*OT9 fans who are still thinking that by supporting Jessica, you are supporting SNSD, have you woken up yet? Take a look and see for yourselves. Weeks of insults, abuses and name-calling for Tiffany by maomaos. Most of the maomaos will simply use your support to leverage even more hate against SNSD and you are helping them to get there.*

*Some of you are confused about the entire notion of ""Real SONEs will support all nine."". That was based on the original assumption that SNSD finally retire honorably and gracefully to assume individual activities and SONEs will be there to support them as individual artistes. However, this is not the case for Jessica because she was dismissed from SNSD and therefore stripped of further honors as SNSD from 30 Sep 2014 onwards.*

*Jessica is now an artiste for a rival company and every single cent and achievement she earns can be potentially used against SNSD, as we can see from here. It's not going to stop here. We will continue to see maomaos attacking any of SNSD's upcoming individual activities, group comebacks or solo debuts.*

*OT9 fans, it's time to come to your senses. Jessica is no longer part of SNSD and therefore SONEs are no longer obliged to help her in any way. She no longer addresses her fans as SONEs but maomaos so OT9 fans are deluded by their own emotions of being unable to let go of her. Let her go and forge her own path by her own means now.*

@sonesone9751,"lmao. maomaos are so annoying. they way you guys hate on tiffany and saying that jessica is better makes me hate jessica. if tiffany is a flop, why would billboard ranked her? why would entertainment weekly notice her as a must listen artist? why would heartseekers ranked her? why would she get 4 stars  in IMZ (which is the highest even SNSD hasnt reached 4 stars) Tiffany once stated that she doesnt care about the rankings and this is according to American Stephanie Young ""Tiffany"" Hwang. if you guys pay attention, you'd notice a few things about SM Ent. 1. When its about group concepts, songs, styles, they control it. but when it comes to their artists' solo, its according to their own style. Korean Tiffany is what we see in SNSD but this is the American Stephanie that we see in IJWD. 2. You'll notice that SM style isnt Korean style but more to what foreign people like. Im not saying all foreign people, but take a look guys. SM Ent = Not so public friendly and more easy to foreign fans. YG Ent = their music style/fashion = full of swag/hip hop and its what their fans like JYP Ent = public friendly/gives you a lovey dovey feeling. like Jessica isnt a part of SM Ent. She's in Corridel Ent rn. People are saying that ""HUH! Smaller agency Corridel beat SM Ent. Lmao. the reason why Jessica did so well is because her power in SOSHI, her presence in SM and SNSD in the pass. that helped her alot. if Corridel's so good, then why isnt Playback that famous?

@etiennebanana1425,This is just an analysis regarding the comparison of views between Tiffany's and Jessica's haha i hope there would be no hate. The reason why Jessica's mv has more views than Fany's is maybe because it is her first public appearance as a solo artist after her departure of Snsd and people are curious. And Jessica herself is already big so there's no need to belittle her agency hahahaha just my point of view tho 😊😊,0,2016-05-27T14:01:25Z

We all know how Tiffany isn't exactly the best dancer in GG and choosing to bring out a song that requires her to do intense choreography (for her level) is really something that should be applauded.

@noface_shizun,"I don't get people replying to comments like ""I like Jessica/Tiffany's song better"" saying ""Fuck no, this or that is better !"". People are human, they're bound to compare things and songs sung by two girls who were from the same group, more so if they came out at the same time. That's like one person comparing dark chocolate and milk chocolate: it's a matter of tastes. People don't have to go around forcing their opinions on people. Because they are just that, opinions. If people didn't have that, the world would be fucked up.  
So what if Jessica's fans were fucking douchebags or antis (not even fans of them) trying to start fanwars. What if Jessica was a liar (or something I don't even know and I don't freaking care). Legitimate opinions are about the songs and not the singers. People are freaking immature hating on the singers because of their fans. I don't go around hating the wrong people. ""Jessica's fans are douchebags so I hate Jessica."" What would that make of you ? A better douchebag ? Man, that's like basic common sense. Seems like fans are just so biased they end up blind. Yeah yeah I know,  Singer's fans are pissing you off so you have to piss them off. Grow up. Be the bigger person for fuck' s sake.",29,2016-05-25T21:44:00Z

@rena5226,only petty bitches comment hate on Tiffany tbh this song isn't that bad and why y'all comparing Jessica and Tiffany they have different taste in music and let them express that. Let them do them for once without any hate. let them do what makes them feel happy and just support them at least they try to do something in their life. instead of judging people why don't y'all judge yourself first put your shoes in those people's lives you would get annoyed by the hate too . it's cute to see people that don't like Tiffany still watching her keep it up 👍,0,2016-05-24T22:05:56Z

@viviankp89,her voice in the 'stickwitu' video was so much better. This song does not do it justice. it makes her voice sound so mediocre with mediocre melody. SM is wrong to 'use' her to rival Jessica's debut. Tiff's voice deserves more recognition than this. You can disagree with me but you know it's true..,0,2016-05-24T05:02:05Z

@riffgroove,"I finally got my copy of Tiff's wonderful album a couple of days ago and have been listening to it non-stop.
     I really wanted to congratulate Tiffany and SM's songwriters who picked a musical style that fit our pink monster so perfectly. Whereas Taeyeon's ""I"" was much more contemporary sounding, Tiff's album is more dance-able but mature sounding.
    Being a woman now, it wouldn't make sense for Tiffany to do cutesy, bubble-gum Kpop anymore and they picked a great sound for her.
   Favorite tracks are IJWD, What do I do and Once in a Lifetime.

    Tiffany has been so good to us over the years. Most importantly, she's *never stopped* being good to us.

   I, for one, am extremely proud of her. :-)
Great job, Tiffany",5,2016-05-24T00:24:26Z

She is screaming to the world that will learn a lot more and all the girls of Girls Generation support it. Jesica and she have different rhythms and as Jesica said in a interview that he hopes to support both good ways that do not compare to each other which is better because it believes are well and those who are considered Sones de corazon thanks for support and of those who do not support and criticize guess they are not SONEs who always see the past and do not see in what have become these two artists I the support for the two and although Tiffany is my bae Jessica always leaneth because she he was part of Girls Generation and never forget that passed moments of groups and Jesica and Tiffany always supported each other thanks for reading this !! and thanks for respect my opinion.",0,2016-05-22T15:33:23Z

I don't want it be like that and plss and SNSD, Tiffany's anti-fans stop bashing Tiffany and saying this song is sucks, that's why Tiffany and Jessica fans will have a war, and the anti-fans saying that they are Jessica's fans but they are not and saying Jessica's song is better so Sone and Jessica's fans will have a war, and for me Jessica's song is my type but I love this song too its unique.

@eushimayo,It's okay Tiffany. You did a great job for this solo debut. Many thanks for your IJWD. Winning in music shows is great but as long as you're happy with what you're doing is more than that. So sad to know that Inkigayo 22 May is your goodbye stage. Hope you will make another solo comeback next time with much better music. Make sure in future you compose your own title songs too. See you on next solo comeback. Thank you Tiffany! 😁,4,2016-05-22T11:25:56Z

Unexpected style of her dancing and singing, also different tones(not that husky, powerful voice).. I think Tiff did her best with her new challenge. Said she wanted to show something new as a solo and good dancer, she made a difference what she used to perform... Lyrics, repetitive too much, and we're unfamiliar with that kind of dance. That's why many people could not feel the song itself easily.. Anyway it's a worthwhile challenge for Tiff at this time..",0,2016-05-22T02:06:03Z

@katrinakl,"Everyone, just ignore the maomaos. Tiffany chose to make the type of music that represents her. She wants us to listen to it because we enjoy it and support her not because we want to win some unspoken competition. She doesn't want to start fan wars. Not everyone likes her and not everyone likes her music. That's life. The good thing is that so many people do enjoy it and love her, and the views represent that. 

To be honest, Jessica would probably be disappointed to learn that some people are watching her mv as revenge against SM, not because they enjoy her music.

Keep watching IJWD if you like it and forget about those who don't.",1,2016-05-21T17:41:49Z

i will support the person who never said anything after 9/30, only humbly apologized and bowed down and promised to repay the fans with wonderful performances and music just to fill in all the bad things that has happened
i will support this girl who, from the very beginning, has inspired and continues to inspire me to work hard and be positive and share love and compassion despite the struggled shes been through
i hope people can see how this person should be what every woman should, strong, brave, passionatem independent, caring and loving
i hope the haters can see this 
kids, this is the woman you should emulate and not hate
to dream big and work hard

most of you are still teenagers i bet

@fanyhwang8524,"This is what Jessica's Said in the interview

Understandably, she was a bit cautious about mentioning Girls' Generation and SM Entertainment at first.  She started off with, ""I'm not sure what to say,"" but then opened up with her affections for her previous group, stating, ""I wouldn't be here without Girls' Generation.  If there were no Girls' Generation, there would be no me.  Also, Girls' Generation would not be here without the company.  It's very precious.  I have no desire to deny who I was at the time.""


Regarding the process of her departure, she said, ""There was no choice but to make that decision.  Our interests were different.  We had to separate at some time; I just think that my time of departure came first."" In relation to some of the negative viewpoints, Jessica said, ""If there's any misunderstanding, I will resolve that at any time.  The truth will go through in the end, and when time passes, I believe [people] would come to recognize [the truth].""


She was also asked about debuting as a solo artist at the same time asTiffany.  She said, ""I heard her music and saw her MV.  It was very cool.  I thought how it expressed greatly what Tiffany wanted to do.  I hope she does well.  As for competition?  Our colors are too different.  We came out at the same time unintentionally, but our music and our individuality are different.  I think there's a fun in seeing our different charms.""",27,2016-05-21T13:42:00Z

@sleepinggiant4145,"MaoMao's hating on Tiffany's video.......

There are allot more SNSD fans than MaoMao's, yet Jessica's video has more views and *much less than half the dislikes*
It is pretty obvious *which fan base is petty and cruel*, just go look at the comments over there.  So many very very negative SNSD comments with *literally Hundreds of thumbs up*

Where are all the ANTI-JESSICA comments here, with Hundreds of thumbs up??
- they don't exist

I liked Jessica's video because it is good, and I like her song *as obviously so many SONE's did*.  Yet clearly the MaoMao's don't feel the same way about Tiffany and unlike us they play dirty",29,2016-05-21T12:09:35Z

Also, I don't know if anyone else notices this but, out of all the girls in snsd she seems the least stressed. If anything she doesn't seem stressed at all which, is CRAZY because, she has a lot of responsibilities in the group. Like she has a lot of spotlight but, she seriously looks happy with her job. And her smile!!! She has the BEST smile it's so pretty and natural. Me encanta la sonrisa de Tiffany!! Taeyeon out of ALL K-Pop female members looks STRESSED TO THE MAX. She needs a break for at least a month. Tiffany went from my least favorite member of Girls' Generation to top 3.",71,2016-05-21T06:39:49Z

I feel good
Light reflects on the wet streets
The city is like an empty stage
After a show ends
It’s alright It’s alright
Into the wet air
The street lights shine on me
I like it, my body is moving
I just wanna
dance the night away
As I close my eyes
dance in the moonlight
It’s getting hotter
I can’t stop myself, no way
I just wanna
dance the night away
dance the night away
I just wanna
dance the night away
dance the night away
I just wanna
I wanna get more messed up
Than being immersed in a very sad movie
The headlights are like
The rhythm dancing on the highway
It’s alright It’s alright
The buildings that completely fill up the space
Are like an audience
Everything is ready
I just wanna - the corse - 
I hid myself behind the masks that change every day
I just wanna get more honest right now
- the corset-

@sp1nrx,"K-POP is so fascinating because of the fan base of each group. The amount of love & hate displayed in the comment sections is beyond reality.

 How anyone can *hate* - and hate is a very powerful state of emotion - someone they have never met or dealt with, even after seeing them on stage or a video, is a measure of your own self-esteem. You hate XXX exactly why? Oh, they interrupted your dream music act or they can't dance as well as others, or they're loud, or they have ambitions outside of their public life? Reasons like this show that *YOU* need to work on yourself, on working towards *your* dreams and goals, not letting others dictate how you do it and, most importantly, not wasting energy hating.

K-POP is a business and if you think or wish your life would be as glamorous, famous or having thousands idolizing you, you are not moving in that direction. People who do are aren't dreaming: they're *DOING* and only those who do can understand that this is all a business of *entertainment* not of granting dreams.

Work towards your dreams without hate or misplaced love and you will be a happier person who isn't compelled to publicly announce love or hate towards people you don't even know (and I can assure you that you really don't know these people other than what they share with you).",1,2016-05-20T22:20:00Z

@chocolatecake2935,I think that Tiffany's song is better than taeyeon's. But only because on an international level IJWD would do well. 'I' is a song that would be very popular in Korea but not in the western. Tbh I was disappointed in this song because the beat didn't drop nicely but the rest of the album bangs. If you are a Tiffany Stan and your were a little bit disappointed go listen to the album it's really good. Out of taeyeon Tiffany and Jessica solos. Jessica wins for me.

Fly was boring for me and her voice is hurting my ear. IJWD caught my attention right away and this only happens to me on TTS songs, Lion Heart, You Think and Mr Taxi (SNSD related songs). Call me a hater of Jess and Maomaos or a delulu Tiff biased. I don't care. All I know is I'm a true sone after Jessica's departure from the group.",61,2016-05-20T15:08:33Z

You criticized what the most stupid fans do but now you do the same.

@TheRenflower,"She is at almost all Spotify viral chart, she made Heartseeker Album chart at USA which is rare for Kpop acts, she is on the top three Billboard world Album chart. Her album praised by the biggest and most relevant musical critics of Korea Izm and got FOUR FULL POINT which is so rare for any album (even SNSD doesn't have full four points yet) she praised by Pro Music Korea and she's getting so many good reviews for  her well prepared and balanced album. She sold more than 40K album. She is still top50 charts when her song is not public friendly or familiar taste for Koreans (no wonder why there is still ballads or Cheer Up like kid songs) she showed us her invudial style and she is prove us how far an average person would go. She wasn't born with a high quality vocal, she wasn't born as a natural dance. She is what a person should look and got impression and feel respect towards her.

Additionally, the EP's title track is No. 10 on the World Digital Songs chart. Meanwhile ""What Do I Do,"" a standout cut from the release which came in both Korean and English renditions, is at No. 14 on the tally.",3,2016-05-19T05:24:33Z

But the more I listen to it, the more I like this song and now I really understand that this song suit her voice and personality so much. I think this is really great. She's from a girl group who's now doing a solo. And she didn't try too hard to fit in or make a ""too much"" catchy song. But she just being herself. This is the kind of music she like and usually sing. This is the kind of music that suit her vocal tone. I'm so in love with this song now, like I'm so done with all the cutesy cute song. This song kinda like chill, and lets go dancing but not too wild. Yeah, I love it. Thank you Tiffany for being yourself.",0,2016-05-19T02:24:14Z

I’m a Tiffany-bias, but its pretty obvious that her solo was just a pawn used to attack Jessica and Coridel. If Jessica hadn’t announced that she was making an album.

@alliyahanjamason1208,"I really like this song from Tiffany. I'm waiting for a copy of her cd+Poster to arrive. I came by K-pop last year and enjoy it. I like Girls Generation, T-ara, 2NE1, Sistar and AOA and I may be condemned for what I say next as heresy but K-pop artists do music and MVs better than anything here in the west and you get more bang for your buck because when you buy a k-pop cd as  you get a cd+photobook and poster, which you don't get here in the west.

@JatkaJay,"The lyrics are too basic, as if this song was written in a rush. Tiffany sounds too breathy for a simple song like this I guess it was meant to sound sexy but it only made her sound like she has low stamina, basically it could have been better. The dance choreography too, seems like it was the result of a hasty decision. Maybe Tiff can't really dance so I'll cut her some slack. It's an interesting mv though because I was expecting a nightclub scene which would fit this song more but the daylight rigid dance was the chosen one. Ok. SM knows best.",0,2016-05-18T11:10:08Z

@richieldelosreyes511,"SONEs, it's saddening that we are still supporting Jessica in her song where the majority of the views came from  our fandom but what  her fans returned as gratitude are insults toward Tiffany esp. SNSD. I don't want to make it seem like a competition but if Jessica's mv surpasses Tiffany then those bitches will use that as a reason to hate Tiffany even more, it will happen because Jessica's views are gaining numbers way faster than Tiffany. And those views, again, came from us. So why don't we help out Tiffany here. I love Jessica and I'm glad that we are continually loving her even after everything but haters will make a big deal and chaos if she surpasses Tiffany's view count.",59,2016-05-18T08:30:03Z

@DBSNT,"Comparing SNSD's situation to the movie ""Dream Girls"", I could totally see Jessica as Jennifer Hudson and Taeyeon as Beyonce. sparkly eyes Call it a fantasy, but I wish they could all perform as 9 again. It's okay if it's not the 9-member GG we all saw, but an OT9 group of sisters we've all come to love through the years of happiness and hardship. If only they could meet again, pro'lly sing together again, then I can die happy. fanspazzes

@TreadstoneOperative,"*I think some of you are still hallucinating. Jessica is no longer part of SNSD and therefore you cannot call upon SONEs to support her because Jessica's fandom is called maomaos (which is actually a Chinese-named fandom - Jessica has stopped addressing to SONEs since she left in 2014).*

*Every view and support you give to Jessica means one less view and unit of support for Tiffany, and the end result is still the same - haters will use Jessica's successes to bash Tiffany and SNSD, no matter how you wish to otherwise.*

*You simply underestimated the capacity of hatred these antis have for SNSD. They won't stop until SNSD is dead. That's their motto.*",54,2016-05-18T02:49:25Z

@GIGIKHU,"our Fany voice is unique, some people might not prefer her voice, especially combined with pop style, it might be not your fav preferences, and no one can argue what you prefer. if comparing her voice to some people is unavoidable, cos thats how our minds works, but forcing everyone for your own liking that is so childish. we enjoy what we want to enjoy. so why fighting, if we can love something we enjoy listen to. 
so dont come here just to do that or even worse, cos our Miyoung is precious kid we treasure a lot. she's the sweeetest kid we have, who proudly says she loves pink and ice cream and unicorn, she always look at everyone eyes so brightly and a very caring person. never once we see anyone who ever met her and converse with her said a bad thing about her. she's that kind of kid. we're all sone very proud of you.",7,2016-05-17T16:55:42Z

Tiffany said for her solo she focused on making the MUSIC THAT SHE WANTS TO. She said she didn't want to focus on sales because it would make her lose her ""musical colour"" and individuality just for the sake of better sales. She didn't want to make some generic catchy kpop song just for sales or for the sake of being ""catchy"". She stuck true to herself and made a solo debut that represents her and thats all that matters. BYE HATERS",478,2016-05-17T16:46:57Z

@AJZoomerFIT,"Let's be honest over here... You ppl need to stop all this comparisons between Tiffany & Jessica camps. There's no need for name branding, bashing others based on different opinions. Considering my bias is Tiffany, whom I've always preferred her vocal tone to  Jessica's (which sounds nasal at times) After watching both videos, I guess point goes to Jessica, sounds contradicting but it's the truth, like it or not! To say am I bias - NO, disappointed - YES! Why - should Tiffany had released a different track from her album such as 'What Can I Do' to be her debut, she would've killed the charts, which saddens me becoz 'I Just Wanna Dance' isn't a good choice for a debut release which doesn't showcase any of her vocal range and power. 

By comparing number of views between Jess & Fany isn't fair - while Fany still in SNSD, automatically reached out to the wider SNSD fan base, cannot be compared to Jessica, completely now on her own, under a different company. In fact, Sone fans need to be aware that Tiffany, still under SMTown, now saturated with much stiffer competition amongst other artists, who's breaking out as solo artists.... Tiffany is in much danger considering the saturation of artists, I am afraid SM Management will focus much spotlight on her, compared to Taeyeon. (Have u thought about that), whereas Jessica doesn't face much competition or lack of attention in Cordial. Jessica's trash-talk over at her video was caused by the negative comments over Tiffany's, (out of spite) behavior is very obvious. U oughta grow up.  

Looking at some of the comments made (understand no doubt there're those who truly likes it, that's fine) But reading those saccharine sweet comments that are sugar-coated with over-praising how good the song is, blah, blah, which I claimed those as blind followers... C'mon how can y'all call yourselves fans with the continuing bashing against one another and trash-talk towards Jessica. Considering myself a Tiffany supporter always, a true fan should always be upfront and honest when comes to opinions of songs. Do not confuse constructive criticism as negative comment, as much we all wish for Tiffany's success, feedback & encouragement are necessary to help her learn from mistakes so she'll make better albums in future. Keep on fighting! Peace I'm out. x",1,2016-05-17T06:25:28Z

I wish we can also see Hyeyeon do some crazy dance song solo as well. And this song can not be compared to Jess's song, no way! just because u love her stop comparing, honestly I hate Jessica's song  cuz its so boring, and if it is so called ""meaningful"" since she suffered whatever it should have been a much more strong a waow effect kinda song that would have blow our minds and make us say yess she s done it, she just came back strong but no the song is absolutely boring.......but I hate more the fact that two songs are idiotically compared like they are same song sang by 2 different artists.

@Luke_vegan,"I have a question, Jessica can't perform on music shows because of Tiffany suddenly having her solo debut? Seriously, that's so evil. They humiliated Jessica and kicked her out when she was working almost all her life with them! And now they don't even want to let her shine with her solo debut. 
I think this is all planned. It's not the first time SM do this move, didn't they block JYJ(former members of TVXQ) from music shows as well? 
Jessica released her news of her solo debut WAY before Tiffany. But now Tiffany suddenly said she wants to make her debut in May, and that move is to block Jessica",3,2016-05-16T17:21:36Z

@Sweetoholic,"I normally do not like Tiffany's voice. I'll always give things a try but it usually makes me cringe. I can't explain it... Not to hate on her, she could always sing but her voice was never my cup of tea... It just always seemed too flirty? I can't put my finger on what exactly it was about her voice...

But this. Honestly, I was very surprised. I did not think I would enjoy this at all... I actually prepared to cringe lol. But this song is absolutely amazing. I don't know about the rest of her album, but these are the vocals I would expect from someone who has been singing for as long as she has been. She shines more here than she ever did with GG or TTS. I'm actually considering purchasing it. Congratulations on your solo debut!",5,2016-05-15T13:09:35Z

@baekkiepouts6445,"I don't get how people can say she doesn't deserve a solo. Like who are you to say? Just because she ""didn't perform well"" on this stage or just because her music isn't your cup of tea you think u have the right to say that? All you see is this but u don't know how much she trained, how much sweat and tears sacrificed, going through so much emotional stress for the past 10 years. While you are partying and enjoying youth, she is practicing her butt off just to get a chance to debut under gg. So who are you to say she doesn't deserve it? Everybody deserve a moment to shine on their own.

And for Christ sake, SHE LOOKS UP TO TAEYEON AND HER VOCALS. she is not here to outshine taeyeon. Stop comparing both of them. 

And for people that thinks this is a flop. 
#1 in 13 countries
#9 in US itunes
#1 on 7 digital charts
30,000 over copies sold on Hanteo

@hyungyu-02,"안녕하세요, 저는 한 소원입니다.제가 동영상으로 티파니누나를 보고 흐뭇한 미소로 댓글을 내려가면서 보다가 댓글을 보고 표정이 굳어져 이 글을 쓰게 됬습니다. 이건 한 사람만이 아닌 모든 연예인들이 다 그럴거라고 생각합니다. 연예인에게 비방하는 글, 악성 댓글, 욕하는 글을 쓰지 말아주세요. 사람은 누구나 다 완벽하지 않기 때문에 부족한 부분은 누구나 다 있을거라 생각합니다. 하지만 누군가의 부족한 부분으로 실망하셔서 그러한 글을 쓰신 거라면 악성댓글, 비방의 말보단 응원의 말 한마디한마디가 더 낳지 않을까요? 그럼 아주 사소한 글 하나라도 그의 진심을 보고 그 응원의 말 한마디에 더욱 힘내고 노력해서 점차 낳은 모습으로 열심히 활동할 수 있을거라 생각합니다. 그렇게 안좋은 말만 쓰시면 오히려 상처만 남기고 더욱 악화만 될거라 생각 됩니다.제가 생각하기엔 마음 깊이 상처받는 이유중 하나가 연예인이 자신을 비난하는 말을 보면 지금까지 내가 대중들을 즐겁게 하기 위해 투자한 시간과 노력들을 돌아보면서 큰 허무함을 느껴서일 거라고 생각됩니다.지금까지 글을 읽고 기분이 나쁘셨다면 정말 죄송합니다. 저는 그냥 한 연예인에 대해서 비난의 말보단 응원의 말, 사랑의 말로 연예인의 기를 죽이지 않고 앞으로도 활기찬 모습으로 대중 앞에 섰으면 하는 마음에서 해본 말이였습니다. 이 글로 기분이 나쁘셨다면 다시한번 죄송합니다.예쁜 얼굴의 맑은 눈망울에 귀여운 미소가 깨지는걸 보면  제 마음도 깨지는것 같기  때문입니다. 물론 당사자인 연예인보단 아니겠지만요... 이 글을 읽어주셨다면 감사합니다.",0,2016-05-14T13:50:10Z

@xxshinrai,"Tiffany is so gorgeous in this MV and her vocals are so lovely. However, overall I felt like the song sounded too chilled out for the lyrics of 'I just wanna dance the night away'. I'm sure this is up to personal preference and interpretation but I would have liked to see Tiffany's vocals soar and let loose and really shout from the rooftops.. because the phrase itself is a way of expressing how much you want to let go and let loose after experiencing stress or frustration. That being said, I still enjoy the song's arrangement and concept for what it is. It's really easy to listen to and a nice summer track.",0,2016-05-13T23:54:18Z

@likim1909,티파니씨가 국내시장보다는 외국시장을 더 염두에 뒀다는 느낌이 듭니다. 한국사람들은 별로 안좋아할 스타일이라서 크게 이슈되긴 좀 어려워 보여요. 한국인들이 듣기에는 약간 고구마먹은듯이 답답한 느낌이 들거라고 봅니다.그리고 티파니씨 음성이 조금 더 여리거나 차라리 더 강하게 뿜어져 나왔다면 훨씬 좋았을 것 같은데 솔직히 약간 음과 목소리가 따로 노는 느낌이에요.물론 곡은 좋습니다만 대중성이 아쉬운 듯 해서 글남깁니다. 그런데 뭐.. 티파니씨 정도 되면 이런 시도는 필요하다고 봅니다. 화이팅!,0,2016-05-13T15:51:01Z

@shinigamiabarairenji,"The song is cool but honestly it wasn't what I was expecting from Tiffany at all. I was expecting something more R&B-ish that shows off her vocal ability more, something similar to ""Holler"" or ""You Think"" and obviously I was expecting the MV to be way more glamorous. If you watched The TaeTiSeo, you know that Tiffany put in a lot of work on the MV for ""Holler"", picking sets and clothes that were super stylish, etc, so I was thinking it would be the same with her solo debut. I wasn't expecting her to be wearing gym clothes and dancing in an empty parking lot with backup dancers that looked a bit man-ish for my taste. It's not that I don't like it, it's just very surprising if you've followed Tiffany and saw her personality (at least the one she showed on TV and such) throughout the years.",0,2016-05-13T06:40:56Z

*1.)* The song is good but could be better... why?
*2.)* Because *everybody* knows dancing is not Fany's strong suit. So the song choice could of been better.
*3.)* These L.A. area MVs are getting a little old, for God's sake! that dinner has even been used in porn movies!(don't ask me how I know) And this is not directed at Tiffany... it's the whole Kpop industry. Hyun-A's video and even JESSICA's ""FLY"" is filmed there... Oh! and do not forget RED VELVET. Try something new, maybe a -black sand beach in New Zealand- <-- never mind Taeyeon & Taylor Swift did it already.
*4.)* Tiffany... *""EAT SOMETHING!!!""* , please no stupid "" she eats blah blah blah "" replies, use your eyes people not your ""Stan"" to judge. The girl had more pounds on her when she was 16!
*5.)* Is SM going through some financial crisis I don't know about? Because the production value is pretty weak? Even JYP videos are coming out better lately.",1,2016-05-13T01:30:29Z

@KrisJavier,"Reading comments in this video, ""sones"" are like this is mediocre this is meh maybe I expected to much.. While non-snsd fans are liking it on first listen and some even said it's on loop.. So what does that tell you? Fany's music is different from snsd, and that is good. Because she needs to differentiate her solo to the group's music. Now for those who keeps on saying that this song is less than what they expected, seriously, what were you expecting? A dance/edm track? Wait for SHY sub-unit or Yuri to do that. Ballad? That would be Tae's or Seo's genre, yes? Fany already mentioned that her album is super pop. This is pop.

@TreadstoneOperative,"*There is no such thing as a perfect song or music video or genre. There is no such thing as fulfilling everyone's expectations either. I am not asking everyone to like the song. I am asking you to be open-minded and just understand that this is just another way Tiffany showcases the different kinds of music out there. Personally, I am enjoying the diversity brought to my senses.*",0,2016-05-12T02:54:07Z

Many people doesn't want this because I think they're expecting like a kpop moves like dubstep or something goes with rap then the beat... But hello she was born in america 😑 actually it's really risky to try a bit change... But for me, TIFFANY DID REALLY DO A GREAT JOB!

Do u guys know APRIL (a cute girls grp)? If no, now i beg u, plsssssssss WATCH TINKERBELL, they just did an amazing comeback on April, n which is THEIR OWN MONTH. They are rly gd n deserves more attention. But unluckily, many other very popular grps were coming back at that time too.
DSP (their company) didn't do well at promoting, so i think we fineapples (fandom name) can do sth. I am not forcing u to like it, but at least know them n watch their MVs at least once PLSSSSSSSS

@gugucloud1000,"*LMAO.* All these ""music critics"" and ""music experts"" need to seriously explain how this song is ""lacking"" or ""boring"". They just simply say the song sucks and thats it. Like uh....are you trolling or just be a plain hater? People would take you more seriously if you gave constructive criticism instead. Just because this song is different from typical ""k-pop style"" people say its ""boring"".....NEWSFLASH!! Not every song needs extreme vocals or beats! This is a representation of Tiffany's individual musical style and she's super proud of it. Just because a song isn't your cup of tea doesnt mean its a horrible song. Tons of people are loving this synth-pop 80's sound. PROPS to Tiffany for staying true to herself despite knowing the fact that she would get tons of hate and koreans wouldnt really love this genre of song as much.",3,2016-05-11T22:53:28Z

@OhMyitsCasey456,"Tiffany's voice is the most unique in GG. It has this depth to it and she's able to do low notes- and although many aren't in favor of her high notes, she is able to reach them.

@greentofuhouse,"The MV was not very impressive but her voice really Wow me. So this is her real tone instead of what she uses in snsd, sounds like she has more depth to her voice than I thought she has which is awesome because I really am not a fan of thin high pitch voices. I think that's why I usually prefer tea than jess when they do high notes. But in snsd since there's a mixture of different sounds, it feels okay but if this song is full of thin voices then I probably will not come back to it. Still good job! And everyone should watch her new variety show. It is really funny :)",1,2016-05-11T16:04:01Z

@fitnessdiary1654,"To all those saying that the song sucks...This is not a typical kpop song you get to hear, it's full of Tiffany's style and everyone can tell it. The fact that she chose to release something SHE LIKES rather than the public will like alone is applaudable. She is releasing something that shows who she is and is establishing her own music style. It is recognised by k-netizens as well and I have seen their comments that they appreciate Tiffany for trying something that she truly loves without trying hard to appeal to the public. Whether one likes this song or not is a matter of personal taste, I didn't like it at first but now I am in love. What's important for a singer is to establish her own style and Tiffany certainly did it. This song suits her and I am pretty sure she is the only one in SNSD who can pull of this song. Everyone has their music style. Taeyeon's I suit her really well and Tiffany probably can't handle that song, but Taeyeon won't be able to pull IJWD off as well. What matters is they found their style and let's just appreciate Tiffany's effort:)",5,2016-05-11T15:52:18Z

@agrippa2310,"Being a Sone fan, I always adore Tiffany's voice. As much I really want to like this song but after hearing a few times I honestly can't say I'm really captivated. Nothing to do with her voice but I juz dun feel the same wow factor as Taeyeon's 'I' did when it first released. Guess it's the song choice, and im not sure i quite like the dance choreography on this video which the energy seems lacklustre. Either a kickoff power ballad to showcase her vocal power or an upbeat fun song would make for her debut... I know the die hard supporters will say positive things no matter what.. As I strongly urge those who keep raving how good it is, to be truly honest that this track could measure up to 'Rain' or 'I'? i feel bad for Fany coz her manager oughta be shot for choosing this as her first single debut... sigh.",3,2016-05-11T15:03:05Z

@darthhwang8382,"It’s been raining for a few days and it finally stopped tonight
I feel good
Light reflects on the wet streets

The city is like an empty stage
After a show ends
It’s alright It’s alright
Into the wet air
The street lights shine on me
I like it, my body is moving

I just wanna
dance the night away
As I close my eyes
dance in the moonlight
It’s getting hotter
I can’t stop myself, no way

I just wanna
dance the night away
dance the night away
I just wanna
dance the night away
dance the night away
I just wanna

I wanna get more messed up
Than being immersed in a very sad movie

The headlights are like
The rhythm dancing on the highway
It’s alright It’s alright
The buildings that completely fill up the space
Are like an audience
Everything is ready

I just wanna
dance the night away
As I close my eyes
dance in the moonlight
It’s getting hotter
I can’t stop myself, no way

I just wanna
dance the night away
dance the night away
I just wanna
dance the night away
dance the night away
I just wanna

I hid myself behind the masks that change every day
I just wanna get more honest right now

I just wanna
dance the night away
In the beat that my city has made
I’m falling deeper
In this moment, I feel the real me

I just wanna
dance the night away
dance the night away
I just wanna
dance the night away
dance the night away
I just wanna",2,2016-05-11T14:49:58Z

@raserusonexuaena6232,"To those people saying this is boring or disappointing. I'm just curious. Just what song are you expecting from Tiffany for you to say that this is a disappointing song for her? Honestly speaking, I also didn't like it at first but I just can't help but love it after listening to it a few more times. Then I came to realize that this song really DOES suit Tiffany and the choreography is something that you would want to dance to. ♥♥♥ I'm really excited for the live shows. ♪♫♪ #IJustWannaDance

Anyways... everyone has their own opinion. Just hoping here for people to refrain from saying that it is disappointing because Tiffany-unnie have worked very hard and long for this mini album. Hwaiting...!!!!",6,2016-05-11T14:12:14Z

Also, I love all SM groups and singers, I love their songs personally but their recent songs somehow don't fit the public taste that much. 
I'm not saying that they should make music that just meet the public taste but I just can't help worrying that people don't like their music and lose interest to them. As a fan, I always want them to be the best.",4,2016-05-11T12:45:52Z

@onemillionpercent,"This is great!! Not my favorite song but of course I will listen to the album before I judge. The genre does give me some (queen) BoA feels but hey, the dancing, the voice, the PINK -- it's all Tiffany alright. (And plus Fany loves BoA yay) I hope it will do well on the charts and amazing for having 1mil+ already! Let's make it to 2mil+ in the next 3ish hours!(24 hours) we can all do this!!:)
Tiffany fighting!!!!!! SNSD fighting!!! Sones fighting!!
P.S. Please don't hate on the song, it's just different. Everyone has different tastes and really it's not a bad song :) I can say that at least even if it's not my type. She probably also worked very hard so yay Tiff! Maybe it really will do very well. The production is nice albeit a little generic and it sounds nice.

@fz_dracohart1255,"I'm a SONE and....I'll lie if I say I love this song :/ Oh nononononono I DON'T hate this! This piece is rather refreshing actually amongst the heavy edm-dubstep trend in k-pop nowadays, and this kinda reminds me to the 90's pop song(?). What putting me in rather dismay is the song is rather...bland? We know repititiveness in a pop song isn't new, but this song sounds like too repetiting and kinda flat and the lack variety of melody is rather a turn off. Thank goodness Tiffany's awesome voice make this track somewhat bearable (In fact her voice is the only good point of this song). Do I sounds like bashing Tiffany? I hope you don't see it that way, because in fact I'm worried for her. Her voice is beautiful but this title track of her solo debut doesn't explore much of her vocal potential. I pray this solo debut of hers won't flop....

I'm complaining about the song, you see. It almost seems like the composer amd lyricist isn't doing their best in the song. I haven't listened to other tracks so actually it kinda rude to predict how well her solo debut will fare. I really really wish other tracks and cover up the weakness of the title track. And oh, I can't wait to listen to What Do I Do! Composed by Tiffany herself and lyrics by the Sooyoung, I bet it'll be great! 

Somehow I actually hoped for a ballad (or slow rock-pop) for solo releases for the vocals, because imho such genres can give them a chance to express their vocal prowess better. But to each of their own, I guess... I just find it personally appealing for vocals to sing the genre outside pop, the main genre of their group or the mainstream genre of the k-pop in whole.

P.S I think I forgot to mention how beautifully bootyful Tiffany here huhehehehehehhehe",0,2016-05-11T12:09:40Z

@phuongjiyong3940,cảnh quay cũng đẹp nhưng không đẹp bằng sản phẩm của cả nhóm. động tác nhảy với vũ đoàn cũng không bắt mắt và cuốn hút như nhảy cả nhóm. nhưng hình ảnh trưởng thành quyến rũ hơn. thoải mái bay bổng tự do phóng khoáng hơn còn nội dung thì chỉ thấy đoạn đầu chắc mơ ngủ xong nghĩ ước muốn nhảy nhót lên cũng k có gì đặc biệt. không hiểu lời nên không đánh giá được. nhạn xét mang tính cá nhân của 1 người nghe nhạc. không muốn so sánh nhưng bài hát này không có sức hút như mấy bài I.

@mazzysoria3801,"Try listenig to this song with your eyes closed. Just feel the beat and the music, relax. I swear, you'll like (appreciate maybe?) it better. I don't think one should judge a song just for one time of listening to it. But that's just my opinion though. No need to argue. Just like when I first listened to TWICE's Cheer Up. I really didn't like it at first but I tried listening to it for a few more times, and now I'm pretty sure I became one of their fans. For a solo debut song, this is surely different but honestly refreshing. But anyways, good luck, Fany! May the best things come your way throughout your whole solo career and also to SNSD's.

@kaitsune00,"Okay, sure that's your opinion. I respect that. But you have no right to call this piece of music 'trash' or 'useless' why? Because Tiffany worked so hard creating this album and she wanted to show who she is through her music. And being a SONE for only 7 months, I know that this is Tiffany's taste of music and I'm so glad she wanted to share it with us. So no you can't say those horrible comments to her or about her, imagine yourself in her position. So instead of criticising the song or the MV, why don't you take a good listen and stop complaining about everything and enjoy life through music for once.

@wqtofu,"Personally, I expected this song to have that 'spark' like Taeyeon's I. I'm not comparing the both of them, they are both amazing singers, I'm comparing the feel I got between the two songs. Tiffany is a wonderful singer, whose vocals, I feel, could have been emphasized more on. There were climaxes here and there, but not one that gave me goosebumps like the other songs Tiffany has sang, perhaps because of the same repetitive tone throughout the song. Again, I'm not trying criticizing her, being a sone myself, this is my opinion, and I believe that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, be it to your liking or not.",0,2016-05-11T09:54:22Z

Tiffany is my bias in the group next to Sooyoung. Like I love the song but the m/v seemed a bit ehh. Of course I bought her album when it came out.

The I just wanna dance part of song is kind of trying too hard to be catchy but not really and too many repetitions is annoying. MV is breathtaking and so is Fany. It's a pretty decent solo debut and she did well. The song could have added more but maybe they're going for simplicity I'm not sure but I had wanted more in the song. It's a nice song though. Also, I think a lot of haters here are not even Fany fans so just ignore.",0,2016-05-11T09:42:33Z

@Mirialan,"Honestly the second listen completely changed my opinion of the track. At first the video was what really impressede, but the song seemed a little lacking and forgettable, but after the second listen man, no way. This song is a definite bop. It just gets better and better. I love seeing this side of Tiffany. It's definitely a side I wouldn't get to see of her in SNSD.",2,2016-05-11T09:17:24Z

@cococatbug,If SM were to release a song into the American/Western media world this would be it. The Boys flopped in the US because it lacked a lot of the Western beats and vibe while this song has a very Western feel to it. It's relaxed in a way that I could jam out to it in my car while I'm coming to/from work or it could be played in the club. I think that's why some people don't like it. It's not what you normally dictate as Kpop and not something GG would typically release. But I like it. I like it a lot.,0,2016-05-11T09:10:54Z

@willr.4994,"I’m a SONE and I really love the 9 girls (yes, I’m including Jessica), but like everyone, I have my favorites, and Tiffany is not one of them (Just so you won´t start saying I'm being biased). I understand that we all have our choices, to each his own. But just because the song isn’t your type, it doesn’t mean it’s bad and also you can’t say it isn’t Tiffany–like. Tiffany is a Cali girl and that’s what she shows in the video, she’s proud of where she comes from. I’m really glad the song has a unique sound, not like k-pop, not like what SNSD does. That’s what solo projects are about. They can be able to show their own style and their own tastes. I also understand that a lot of SONE are very young (or even not that young) and they still expect cutesy songs like beep beep or kissing you, and sometimes SNSD has to give them what they want even if they are already grown ups and have shown their desire to do more mature concepts, just like Tiffany is doing with this. I understand too that I’m part of that like 1% of the SONE fandom that doesn’t have Taeyeon as their bias, and while I love her, and I really liked “I” (it was an excellent song for me) you didn’t judge her personal choices as you’re doing with Tiffany, just because it was Taeyeon’s song, and it’s unfair. That’s all I have to say.

@BowChickaism,"lol when i was done listening and watching the music video i expected people to be loving this song in the comments, i found its nature very interesting.. but i found that there were a lot of complaints/disappointments. i was shocked.

 i actually never really knew who tiffany was until my friend showed me this song 'cause they've been trying to bring me into kpop, but i'm glad i checked this video out. this is by far the most worthwhile track i have listened to in a while from kpop and the video's cinematography is pleasing to the eye.

i do not understand all this 'it's not catchy' or 'this does not stick with me' business happening in the comments, mostly because the catchier i have found a song, the easier it is to kill. other tracks my friend has recommended to me i find too generic or redundant after a while, however this i believe is extravagant enough in its composition and execution that you're able to listen to it many times and discover something new each time.

i am also most used to songs which have integrated different styles and i am compelled to mention that as a kpop song, this has done so quite well -- something to the likes of Wonder Girls' ""I Feel You"".

as an inexperienced k-pop fan but avid listener of differential archetypical music, i must say i am intrigued by Tiffany's track and hope that people furthermore listen with open ears. i found this song to be one of the best korean pop tracks i have listened to (at least so far through the recommendations i have received) and look forward to her career in music.",133,2016-05-11T08:31:47Z

@un0318,진심 스엠은 티파니는 팬들이 뭘 원하는지 몰랐나? 이런 80년대 마돈나가 불렀을듯한 세련될려다 만 노래를 타이틀이라고 가져나왔어?? 댄스가 티파니에 아이덴티티는 아니잖아.. 솔로할려면 확실한 색깔 가지고나와도 모자른데 소녀시대에서 보여준모습이랑 다른건좋은데 어울리는건 확실히 아니다... 댄스곡 가지고나왔으면 기깔나게 춤연습해서 사람들 wow하게 해도 모자른데 솔로 앨범 한번내고 끝낼거아니면 티파니한테 어울리는 색 잘 찾아서 노래 가지고나왔으면 좋겠다. 수록곡들이나 들으러가봐야겠다,0,2016-05-11T08:24:45Z

@jessastyles7883,"Lyrics: ( english translation )
It’s been raining for a few days and it finally stopped tonight
I feel good, light reflects on the wet streets
The city is like an empty stage
After a show ends
It’s alright It’s alright
Into the wet air
The street lights shine on me
I like it, my body is moving

I just wanna dance the night away
As I close my eyes dance in the moonlight
It’s getting hotter
I can’t stop myself, no way

I just wanna dance the night away
dance the night away
I just wanna dance the night away
dance the night away
I just wanna

I wanna get more messed up
Than being immersed in a very sad movie

The headlights are like
The rhythm dancing on the highway
It’s alright It’s alright
The buildings that completely fill up the space
Are like an audience
Everything is ready

I just wanna dance the night away
As I close my eyes dance in the moonlight
It’s getting hotter
I can’t stop myself, no way

I just wanna dance the night away
dance the night away
I just wanna dance the night away
dance the night away
I just wanna

I hid myself behind the masks
that change every day
I just wanna
get more honest right now

I just wanna dance the night away
In the beat that my city has made
I’m falling deeper
In this moment, I feel the real me

I just wanna dance the night away
dance the night away
I just wanna dance the night away
dance the night away
I just wanna",1,2016-05-11T08:02:49Z

@liv4050,"Everyone has to learn to be get over other's opinions. I personally love this song, it's catchy and addictive and I love the beat but it isn't anything revolutionary. But when has anything ever been? This is 2016, everything has been done before, I wasn't expecting anything experimental or critically acclaimed. I actually thought she was going to release a ballad, so I'm glad. Anyway, I really like this song, and she looks very happy. I'm proud.",1,2016-05-11T07:54:59Z

This song does have a few faults but the whole production direction and choreography is beyond aesthetic and so amazing! I'm so proud to be a sone.,20,2016-05-11T07:22:57Z

我知道一定會有人比較
但我不明白比較的理由(過幾天又要比一次了吧kkk)
也有人認為妮妮用這首作為主打出道很不給力
但請先把她整張專聽完
我不懂音樂
但我覺得整張專輯的概念很清晰明確
風格一脈相承
我覺得很有她的個人特色
一開始我也很在意她的音源成績
但其實只要她能完成自己的solo夢想
做自己的音樂
這也是一種成功啊

This song is good, I just personally think everyone will easily get bored of it. It may slay all the charts and Tiffany may have many awards, but it's probably because of a huge number of GG's fans, not because of how amazing the song is itself.

Okay; 2 solo debuts done (+1 if Jess is still a member huhu), 6 more to go~
Is it amazing how the members have different vibes on their music?
Taeyeon's music is soft rock, jazz & ballads.
Tiffany's chill vibes, smooth song.

Solos should be taken as a chance for an artists to express their individuality and musical style. Its not supposed to be used to just release another typical catchy k-pop song. This is unique and 100% represents Tiffany. She loves this kind of music and is enjoying the process. Thats all that matters, not whether it is ""winning no.1 worthy"" or not. Please respect her hard work on this album and putting her heart out there. This was amazing in every way and if its not your personal taste then just leave, no need to bash her.

@janethnavarro4838,"No sé cual es la cosa que tienen contra la canción tanto como con el vídeo, osea porque comparan esto con ""I"" de Tae, todos sabemos que ellas dos tienen un estilo muy diferente. No porque no les haya gustado significa que de una vez tengan que juzgar. Tiffany puso todo su esmero en este álbum, ella misma dijo que desde 2014 esta preparando esto, años trabajando duro y lo que hacen ustedes es solo comparar y juzgar, que si la canción no fue buena o el vídeo no gustó. Yo respeto sus opiniones, pero lo que me molesta, es que saben que tiff puede ver estos comentarios, donde desprecian en sí su trabajo. Tiffany tiene el apoyo de sus fans, y si el primer álbum no llegó a ser tan famoso, ¿que tiene?, lo importante es que ella se haya sentido satisfecha con lo que hizo y  más importante que se haya divertido haciendo lo que le gusta. Ella es una gran cantante y sobre todo talentosa. Un cantante al realizar algo por primera vez, se va a sentir super nervioso, y tanto Tae como Tiff lo confirmaron. Esto no es fácil, la industria de la música es algo con lo que no se tiene que bromear. Otra cosa más, porque también hacen una competencia de este álbum con el de Jess, ¿cuando esto fue una competencia?, jamas fue una competencia desde el principio, ni siquiera ellas han hecho de esto algo así, solo son ustedes los fans ignorantes que quieren poner cosas entre medio que no hay y nunca existieron. Jess y Tiff están siguiendo sus sueños, y lo están haciendo orgullosamente, porque ambas han puesto todo a juego por lograr sus sueños. Si no les gustó el vídeo ni la canción, guárdense sus comentarios destructivos e hirientes. Ninguno tiene idea de lo que esto puede afectarle a ella, porque sentirá que su esfuerzo no sirvió para nada y eso no es cierto, el álbum esta totalmente precioso, ella es hermosa, todo concuerda con su estilo, la canción tanto como el vídeo son su estilo, no esperen de ella algo improvisado, esperen de ella algo que la complemente, porque todos tenemos un estilo propio, y el de ella es así, divertido, extravagante. ¿Quieren una canción movida y con electrónica?, váyanse a escuchar a otros artistas que tengan ese estilo de música. Tiffany es una sola persona, única, y ella también tiene corazón al igual que todos nosotros, así que dejen de decir cosas malas en contra de ella.",0,2016-05-11T00:30:43Z

@renatamora1457,"I don't follow snsd or anyone from the group specifically so I really tried to watch this video neutrally, since I don't really think much of Tiffany or many to the snsd girls. I can't quite tell what it is but this song needed something. I think a lot of people agree that this song needed a rapper to give it THAT kind of vibe. Also, when you hear the title ""I Just Wanna Dance"", you don't exactly expect to hear complex lyrics or anything like that. So I think this song also lacks depth in it's lyrics as well. And while the choreography is GOOD it's nothing spectacular, I don't know much about dancing, but I think any human with a brain and the ability to identify patterns can tell that this choreography isn't anything new... in fact, I've seen many of these dance moves done by f(x), so the dancing feels kind of bland, but I'm glad the dancers look like they're enjoying what they do and that they keep casting dancers of different ethnicity. Finally, I think the music video in general, at least the visuals, were also kind of lacking because we've seen what SM could do with visuals (I mean with NCTU and Press your Number and Rain). You sort of have your typical girl in a swimsuit, on a bed, wearing five different outfits and looking pretty next to something related to water. In my opinion, SM could have done better with the visuals. So with all this, you probably think I don't like this song right? That's actually not true... while there are some mistakes that pretty BIG, the song is at least pleasant to listen to (sort of like 4 Walls) and Tiffany looks so different, it's hard not to ignore how she basically captures your attention for 4 min where everything is pink. It was a good video, I'm glad I saw it, I think it shows potential for Tiffany. It's not AMAZING but it's fine :)",1,2016-05-11T00:17:45Z

@officialchickentender,"TIFFANY IS AMAZING! BAE KILLED IT! SHE SLAYED IT! SHE WAS SO UNIQUE IN THIS! LOVE IT!
What my first reaction was that I was like is she at the pink motel cafe and then I noticed out of her and her back up dancers (which I wish would appear on Mucis Bank, Music Core, The show, etc but can't) was that she was the only one wearing converses and the other girls had vans. Lastly, she was so pale and skinny compared to the other girls! I wish she ate a bit more or got a small tan.",0,2016-05-11T00:14:32Z

3rd time, yap, this mv is bad!
the song sounds better without looking at the MV, seriously, try it! 

and after listening to the whole album, i love that it has the 90's vibe..but i  wonder why she chose ""I just wanna dance"" as the main track.. ""Fool"" and ""What do i do"" are better options for a solo debut i guess.. This song is good, but it doesn't make me want to click the replay button again and again.. as a Sone, but also a music enthusiast, i feel sorry for that :(

She did hit a high note and sounded good, but she never had a power moment and just didnt use all her strengths like Taeyeon does. Other SONEs should know that Fany is a huge power singer, not a huge control singer. Love JeTi to death and I'm just gonna have to wait for Fly by Jessica to see if her song utilizes her strengths properly and gives a good song as well",0,2016-05-11T00:10:55Z

@fsdjify,"This might not be a type of song to ranks the first place in music charts. But the concept/mv/music are not the ones you can see from GG's music and it expresses Tiffany so well. As a fan, that is all I want.  I went to her showcase yesterday and her stage was unbelievable (the song is much better with the dance choreography). Tiffany also said, all she wants is to enjoy her music with her fans rather than winning the first place at music shows. After the stage, she was sweating all over and before even catching her breath, she asked how it was. The fans shouted ""the best!"" ""thank you"" ""I love you"" and she started crying. Seeing her tears, I could feel how this girl put her everything into this music and I was so determined to put my every effort & support for this as well whether her choice was right or wrong.",233,2016-05-10T23:38:19Z

@TsubasaNoAkutenshi,"I think this song would be appreciated more by Non-Korean/International fans. It feels like people don't like it if Kpop sounds like  a 80's retro dance. Just like what happened with ""I Feel Good"" by Wonder Girls last year, which I think is one of the best comeback last year, but not many people like it.
But, really hope that this album would make a success.",5,2016-05-10T22:46:43Z

@k-popfantics...2642,"Why do I always think that Tiffany is just a girl problematic,depressed,full of troubles . And I think his boyfriend dumped her here as you can see at the phone though maybe . She is just thinkinf so deep like maybe daydreaming until she fell asleep . Then all the stuffs that She is at the beach it seems like she was with someone (I think boyfriend) that's why she keeps looking . And the dancing in the street part is all she ever wanted  . Then she finally woke up this time she realized that she just can't dance that easy so it's better for her to just dance in her dream . The restaurant she have been maybe that's where the time with his boyfriend .

Ella es talentosa, hermosa y sin duda tiene un gran potencial. También ella ha tenido que luchar mucho contra las criticas, si era muy gorda, si su coreano era malo. Estoy orgullosa de ver lo lejos que llego Tifanny y que haya sido la segunda de SNSD en obtener su debut solista. Creo que la próxima debería ser Sunny, luego Seohyun. Las demás esta claro que prefieren otros caminos, se que cuando GG se separe ellas no se iran por el canto.

Love those songs! ) but I feel like it's missing a lot. The song sounds just like one tone. The chorus didn't have any wow factor. The video was very cliché.  It's not a bad song but it's not the best. Maybe they could've picked a different song from her album. Anyways,  glad she's finally going solo and maybe she'll wow us more in the future.",3,2016-05-10T21:38:46Z

@christinekim5517,"I find it annoying how everyone is comparing her solo debut with Taeyeon's and putting it down. Both are really catchy and a good reflection of the artist. Taeyeon is more introverted and ""I"" captured the essence of herself and her experience. IJWD really shows the American side of Tiffany and her appreciation and passion for music, thus wanting to dance. I like both songs because I think they really manage to sum up the artists in their first proper solos and not something you would really see from SNSD as a group :) I think we should all just appreciate the thought and hard work that went into both their debuts rather than comparing them because they are quite different ^^",1,2016-05-10T20:52:39Z

This song is very Tiffany style - SoCal (South Californian) girl.  Tbh, a song like Taeyeon's ""I"" would NOT fit Tiffany's style.

This song is more closer to BoA's style actually (Kiss My Lips), and BoA is very successful on her own right too.

Every artist has their own style so I don't even understand why people who dislike this are comparing it to Taeyeon's song.

Both are different because they're different people.  But both are good friends and in the same group together.  So haters are being childish as usual.",2,2016-05-10T20:50:32Z

@MeshayBoo,"Not trying to start a fan war seriously but it's really irritating when people don't like a specific song it's automatically ""boring"" when really, people only don't like the song because they aren't into that specific genre of music, that doesnt make the song boring and the reason I say I don't wanna cause a fan war is because so many people are like this song is boring they should give her better songs like ""I"" when I really wasn't a fan of ""I"", it was good don't get me wrong but it sounded generic and the whole song was repetitive so no I don't want SM to give Tiffany songs like ""I"", honestly ""Rain"" was a way better song than ""I"" and ""Rain"" and ""I Just Wanna Dance"" kind of give me the same feel so in my opinion SM gave both Taeyeon and Tiffany really great songs, it all depends on what you like... I think this song is great, I love this genre of music and that's that, why can't people just quietly dislike a song instead of filling The comments with negative opinions, if you don't like it then watch the video and move it, let the people who enjoyed the song fill the comments with happiness sheesh!

@Brenda-tv8tx,"Honestly, everyones entitled to their own opinions. No one like every type of music out there, and even I have moments where I don't like some songs from my favorite musicians. But this,  I actually really like it. It has Tiffany's footprints all over it. From the pink clothes and effects, to the music clashing with both western and korean style of pop, it screams Tiffany from every angle you look at it. And that's what I love about it, the authenticity of the artist. Okay, sure maybe SM didn't give Tiffany total control, but I like how you can identify that this song, (haven't heard the rest of the album so can't judge the rest), is a TIFFANY song, just like you would do with Taeyeon, and in the future Jessica. She doesn't have to be your bias to support her, she isn't mine when it comes to SNSD, but I'm really happy for her, it's a great song, at least to my ears.

coz as much as she wants success, she was still true to herself. She followed her own style. she did something that could make her happy. she did something that would not only please her fans, but herself as well.

Please continue to support Tiffany :) another thing is that even though Jessica is also having a solo debut, there is no reason to hate on tiffAny or vice versa. Let's all get along and support both of them to do well bc arguing over who's better won't change anything. After all they both have different styles of singing and the genre is also not the same :) even with taeyeon, Tiffany has a different genre of music and shouldn't be compared to her own best friend 🌸🌸",1,2016-05-10T19:58:05Z

,"Tiffany's been my ultimate bias for a long time, although I had many problems to choose (Yeah, I'm looking at you, Wendy). I know how she is and behaves, I know the hate she always gets and of course, I know many of the mistakes she commited (As everyone does). 

However, the point is that I can get you're not hyped or freaking excited about this like I've been and I am. I get that this doesn't have Taeyeon's vocals nor Hyoyeon's dance, but the way she's trying hard to learn, the way she works and puts all her effort to achieve such a challenging choreography for many people is something to take into consideration. I'm not telling you to like her and the song, just don't spread the hate.

And if you're excited about it like me, then really enjoy it and look forward her lives, a long promotion is waiting for us. Saranghae, Tiffany. Fighting!",0,2016-05-10T19:55:45Z

Add the token goofy guy for comedy relief, trying to get past the bouncer or getting rejected by Tiffany on the dance floor.  I expected more from SM.  Actually, I take that back.

i personally think sm is going the other direction that other kpop artists dont dare to go, so recently, shinee fx tiffany (exclude ballad) and probably a bit of super junior had tried this ""old yet new"" kind of music... so a question in my mind, is this an experiment or what?

Okay so i've noticed that SM has been releasing a lot of new music that is a lot like this and it makes me really wonder if this is the music the artists want to produce and it isn't SM forcing them to do it even it's not their personal preference.

Cause first Taemin then NCT then Amber and Luna and now Tiffany.

Then again maybe SM wants them to have a debute song and they want everyone that wants the say vibe to debute with each other

i hope im wrong cause im not a anti i really do like girls generation and taemin and nct u are my babies.
and also if this is the music Tiffany wants to produce and not the cute cute kind Girls Generation use to make maybe SM should let them all have a debute solo song",0,2016-05-10T18:55:33Z

I like ""Yellow Light"" and ""Talk"" better from her album, but neither of those is a promotional song, they're just damn good.

@addrianeperez353,"I had this phase where I didn't like Tiffany cause I I got caught with other people tiny and subtle comments about her being sometimes too much of a perfectionist or fixing every little thing and how she somehow wanted attention. I don't really remember it anymore cause it was a short phase anyways.

But that hate faded when I looked for videos of her and stuff and I started liking her, being all positive, supportive, loving and hardworking. Even if she is deemed ""the laziest dancer"" (as a joke of course but still isn't the greatest), you can see how hard she tries because she's aware that she wasn't given the natural ability to dance like she is able to sing. 

She's gone through so much and I kinda regret not liking her even if it was for a moment, but at least I learned to love her and every other member. She gave up a normal life, had to be away from family and friends, and lost someone so precious to her. Like, how could you hate her knowing all of that? She even learned Korean (which is pretty hard especially is you're fluent in English [in this case her] cause the sentence structures are different and etc.) and now she has her own album, even if it's mini.

I am nothing but an avid fan but I feel so proud. After the numerous things she's faced, now she is a part of one of Korea's best groups that is known worldwide, and has finally released her feelings through music. Us SONEs will always be here supporting each and *every* member (even Jessica...for me at least).So goodluck with your solo debut Tiffany~ Dance as much as you need if that's what makes you feel free~",74,2016-05-10T18:45:43Z

I really don't want to compare them, but it's hard to ignore. If I wouldn't know Taemin's Press Your Number and Drip Drop, I would like it a lot.

@d.orkable8481,"She's so gorgeous oh my gosh!! The song sounds very Madonna like or It's like a slow tempo ""I wanna dance with somebody"" Whitney Houston. So for the people that don't really like the style, it could be because its very 80's with a modern twist, but since music genre changes so easily throughout the years, I feel younger audience don't really know this style/genre and to them its slow and boring. it's very western, but I like it, if it was in English I can picture it on the radios in Canada & America. 
The only thing that bothers me is how the title sequence thing looks so.... amateur? SM Usually has really good Title thingy but it looks like it was made from a Word Doc and it was copied and paste. I don't know why it bothers me but it just does. I keep laughing for some reason.",0,2016-05-10T18:17:56Z

I don't like taeyeon and it's not her fault but her fans they make her seem like she is the best and perfect no matter what and cast other female artist aside. like i understand if shes your favorite but theres no need to talk shit about other artist.stop comparing them together everyone has a different rhythm let them be.",7,2016-05-10T18:07:48Z

on a side note... about this mv and song, its not the typical 'kpop music vibe' but thats okay because its TIFFANY'S SOLO not girls generation and I think people should learn to see the difference between the two. Tiffany's solo is her chance to step out of girls generation's music and create her own.

We all know that most of the time when Tiffany is given a chance to pick a song and sing on stage she always picks english songs (ex. The way, Umbrella, Call me maybe etc) so shouldn't we all know by now that 'Soloist Tiffany' won't give us the 'kpop vibe', plus I love that about her because she is showing us her Cali girl side and making this song all the more her own style!

Lastly, I'm proud of Tiffany for earning this solo and hope she continues shine brighter than ever!! Love the whole album and I'm sure many do as well!!
Fighting, Love! <3

Small and opinionated review: 
I thought the views were stunning and the scenery was great. I think this had the potential to turn into a really great summer song. Some of Tiffany's hardcore fans must be really enjoying it. The mv screams Tiffany. But now onto the song: I really do think it was bland. Too many repetitive beats and not a genre I personally like. Perhaps it'd be a good disco song though.

You're always going to find a way to hate on Tiffany. She sings beyond what you think she can achieve, and you call her a train wreck who's ruining her voice. She releases one song that doesn't put strain on her vocal chords except one high note and you say ""I expected better."" Can you be satisfied with just one thing she does? Can you???

Her tone and vocal style works better with Westernized music then kpop. Like Ailee, if western audiences could get over the fact that they are Asian and get over the idea that just because an artist went through a rigorous training system known as ""The Machine"" that they are just as talented as the people who post videos on YouTube and write their own music. Talent comes in many forms regardless if its manufactured or natural, it should all be appreciated. Congrats Tiffany and like Taeyeon before you, you worked hard and quietly waited until it was your time to shine and now you are able to do the kind of music you want with the support of a powerful entertainment company! Bravo and I look forward to what you do in the future.",282,2016-05-10T17:31:04Z

@Tenderlay,"This song won't be my summer bop. It's really nice, beautiful editing, Tiffany is looking fabulous, but it lacks this unique feel that kpop has. Too much US vibes and this is not what I'm looking for in KPOP. 
Beside the song, it's my first time seeing Tiffany next to dancers who aren't Koreans and with popping melanin, her skin complexion seems way to pale, especially since I used to see her more tanned ....what happened ? And what happened to her curves she looks too skinny ! It's so unhealthy for her.",0,2016-05-10T17:19:11Z

@TreadstoneOperative,"*It's great being a SONE because as a group, SNSD strives to deliver all kinds of dances and concepts, and as soloists, SNSD members continue to showcase all kinds of music genres for their fans.*

*If Taeyeon's debut is indie-bohemian and Tiffany's debut is electro-retro 80s, I am already bursting with anticipation what the 3rd soloist from SNSD will come up with.*

*In short, SNSD are not only trendsetters, they are also educators in music, broadening and deepening SONEs' learning and appreciation of music.*

@GinTo262,"There are good and bad things about this. It's not 'hating' to point out things that didn't work quite well? It's called constructive criticism... Not a sone but I like snsd. She looks gorgeous and the video looks good overall. However she is not a dancer. That shouldn't come as a surprise honestly. I've always thought either a jazzy, diva approach like tts or a Carly Rae Jepson/ Katy Perry girly, pretty approach would really suit her. I mean... Is she performing the choreo live? She's charismatic and bright. Doing a simple and repetitive choreo doesn't really add to the song I guess? Anyways... Props to her for trying new things :) 👍👍👍",0,2016-05-10T17:10:51Z

SM been on a roll lately, music- and artistic-wise, with all their releases, comebacks and debuts. And talk about aesthetics! Oh my god. Been stanning SM since 2010 and I should say, there must be some kind of creative revolution happening inside their management. 

Never thought I'd see this day where SM reaches this level of artistry. I'm almost tearing up. I know they're not totally there yet but I can see they're getting there. And that's great. 

Here's hoping SM consistently delivers from now on and continue to do right by their artists and the music. Hopefully, they'll get to that level in the future (and I'll surely be looking forward to it.)

We can't expect Tiffany's music to be SNSD's music, and it is just terribly unfair to compare her music to Taeyeon's or any of the other girls', because they're showing us their individuality, not SNSD as a whole. It's not about who is better, it's simply about seeing them as an artist. So congratulations to Tiffany for achieving that, because she truly is unique. That's the feeling I get from this: she's unique.

On a side note, you adorable little booger, we know you can't dance <3 <3 <3",130,2016-05-10T17:02:01Z

@ItsBrittanyLajoyce,She looks good but as a solo singer this song does nothing to separate Hee from snsd. It doesn't give her her own unique color as a solo singer the song sounds like a basic 80s throwaway and also like something Snsd would sing. This is no shade just honest opinion for those who hate on those who give their honest thoughts and don't celebrate everything Celebs do. A nice campfire with ppl dancing around at night would have fit the concept of the song more than dancing with dancers I don't even think the choreography fit the music either. I'm sorry but this was a no from me I'll give it a 6 for effort.,0,2016-05-10T16:59:14Z

@taetaebunny2636,"Can you guys stop comparing Taeyeon's '' I'' and Tiffany's song .-.. I get that everyone has there own opinion and all, and yes I personally prefer '' I '' too, but there is no reason to hate on Fany .-. just simply state your opinion and move your butt out of anything else. Have you ever heard of '' If you have nothing nice to say don't say it'' well guess not f$cking idiots. Sorry for my bad language but this is the outcome of me when I see these types of haters o please just stop :l.

Another problem is that people are stating there opinion but other people are taking it as hate. You need to see the difference between hate and opinion. This goes to y'all sensitive people that think that an opinion is automatically directed as hate. Once again please use your brain or whatever you have up there maybe not a brain sadly.... and THINK. Once again sorry for my offensive wording but again just think before you say :l

Overall please just enjoy the MV and support Tiffany  cause she SLAYYYY. If you don't like this MV just simply don't support it and move on without saying hate. I personally love this song and it dam catchy XD so ya the moral is if you don't have anything nice to say don't say it and think before speaking.",0,2016-05-10T16:53:24Z

@AndreggvilJammer,"I'm not a SONE, but I have always been a fan of SNSD, and I found this solo debut a bit disappointing. Before any bashing happens, I wanna clarify that I think Tiffany's capable of much more and her solo should be a big opportunity for her to display her vocals. Though I like this style of music, and I really think it suits Tiffany, I was expecting her to showcase more of what she - as a vocalist - can really do (because tbh not many of SNSD's songs give her a chance to do that, and even then it's only mere glimpses of her vocal potential). I know many people question her position as a main/lead vocalist, and I believe she has the potential to become a great one and she deserves her place as SNSD's main/lead vocal (as much as other people like to believe she doesn't, SM must have placed her there for a reason and SM does have high standards), so I'm hoping her B-side tracks will be able to prove all the haters wrong. Hope to see more from her; lots of love and support from an ELF! <3",1,2016-05-10T16:52:25Z

It may not hook your love and approval at the first listen, (depends on the perspective of each individual) but it eventually gets better as you listen to it more.  Sooner or later you'll probably jam to it. Give it a chance.

*Remember music isn't all about high notes, hard choreography and sensual moves and I see both a Tiffany and a Stephanie showing how a different kind of music is done and she captures the genre well.*",5,2016-05-10T16:27:22Z

It's a whole difference from Taeyeon and it's not what we are going to compare with. even tho her voice isn't strong as taeyeon or any solo artist or some guys will include Jess, it's okay cuz Tiff got her unique voice that no one can compete. When the first line comes up and you know that is her voice I think it's a good material for solo artist to be remembered and have their own style. This beat was so sick.

If you don't like the song, okay! It doesn't have to, but stop saying the song is bad.  Just because you don't like it, doesn't mean the song is bad. I really love the song, is the type of music I listen on a daily basis.

@AlexGomez1226,idk what they were going for but it kinda sounded 80's but the snares and beats are modern so it wouldn't fit in that style. Or they could have made the chorus brighter and more chaotic and make it sound like cyndi lauper. or added a groovy bass/guitar line to make it sound funky and upbeat. In the end it sounded sort of like a mix of wonder girls' reboot album. idk. the sound left me confused. but after listening it the second time i am digging the sound. can't wait to listen to the rest of the album!,1,2016-05-10T16:12:36Z

Still, she reached the top, along with eight other amazing girls, and today she finally could show the world how the color of her music is like, and who she really is.

@MarianHernando,"Me ha dejado un poco fria, tanto la canción como el MV, no sé, esperaba algo más, algo diferente. El estilo de la canción es muy americano y soso. Fanny está preciosa en esos planos en el mar, en la cafetería y caminando por la ciudad, pero falta algo. No expresa esa personalidad única de Tiffany. Incluso el outfit me recuerda un poco a los MVs de Hyuna. Yo creo que eso es en lo que falla; le falta el toque único y personal. Esperemos que las demás canciones del album sean mejores.",0,2016-05-10T16:10:40Z

It is not a song that gets you super hyped but It has a calm vibe I really like combined with the electronic beats. It reminds me of some soft EDM songs out there. As I said I am not a fan so I dont know her personality but I do think he fits the style of the song. I also have seen comments stating that this song doesnt show her vocal range. I agree that USUALLY solos have a powerful vocal and even though powerful vocals are very good, I am more into these kind of soft vocals. Very easy to listen to.",6,2016-05-10T16:09:19Z

@hanna2674,"literally they don't do soaring high notes and people say the vocals in the song isn't good. Her singing is very periodical, fitting for the throwback feel of the song. Furthermore Tiffany sounds better and is more comfortable midrange so people should stop thinking the only way to sing good is to sing big/high. The chill oldie feel of the song is amazing, from the mv to the audio. I find people with big voices like Tiffany commendable for controlling their voices and not show off to fit the mood and the feeling of the song. Also very glad with the diversity sm has with the backup dancers.",167,2016-05-10T16:06:42Z

@theramenbucket,"For me, SM is creating a huge gap from other companies when it comes to experimental music. Analyzing SM's songs this year: experimental. They are following a certain direction. I think SM is trying to avoid the common Korean pop feel. SM's musical experiments turn out to be very good. A few mistakes would be noticed.  SM's songs doesn't sound the same as before. They are itching the need to evolve. This is like what I thought after watching LSM explaining about entering into the New Culture Technology. They are so open-minded and wouldn't even mind to take the risk in doing a different style. That's what making SM so powerful when it comes to music production. Also, analyzing SM's art direction in the ""New Culture Technology"" direction: on point. They are visually representing the song's 'everything'. I don't know how to explain but SM is just so good at aesthetics.

@xdRKOxp,People have their own opinions and I respect that. But I really don't understand the fact that this song is a 1980's inspired song hence the retro looking diner and the neon lights.

Personally, after learning that Jessica was going to debut, I would have pulled Tiffany to hook her up with a banger, this is too low-key like NTC's song.",2,2016-05-10T15:51:04Z

@irlseraph,"To everyone complaining that this sounds ""too American"", Tiffany is from California and her music inspirations are American so the song was bound to sound somewhat like this.

@springdayisnottoday371,"In an unbiased criticism, this is too bland and simple for Tiffany, both song and MV though I couldn't say much about the mini-album since I haven't heard it yet as of this writing but based on the preview I've heard, the other songs seems really good. Now back to this song, I feel that Tiffany could have done much better. If she wasn't just rushed (maybe? Or maybe she and the crew were pressured of the rumors and the fans' hype for her solo debut?) maybe she could have done much more better.

While this song and Taeyeon's I are different in genre, I couldn't feel the same pride I've felt the first time I watched and listened I. Maybe because Taeyeon's solo debut was much anticipated? But this was also very anticipated; we've been waiting since last November. I did not feel anything when I watched and listened this video. I did not feel the hard work and sincerity she and the crew they have put into this song and mv. The song somehow does not connect to Tiffany. Everything just made me confused and annoyed.

The MV has a bit of a story... but that's it? Compared to the other MVs from Red Velvet, NCT U, Ryeowook, Yesung, SM STATION mvs, what have you done? Don't get me wrong, it's fine. I'm not saying it's bad as I know there are much worse there (And SM with a worse mv?) But just comparing this MV to recent MVs released over the last few months, it's a bit eh.

But enough negativity. The dance is amazing! I love the back-up dancers (are they Americans?) and it seems that we're going to see her lie down on the stage floor! Haha, but really... that was so sexy.. I did not expect that at all from Tiffany who has always been innocent and a choding~ 

Perhaps my expectations were too high but we're talking about TIFFANY FROM GIRLS' GENERATION. She is a wonderful, beautiful and talented girl, I am sure she could have done more. But oh well, we get what we get. And, this is just her debut yet. Let's just see what she'll give us next time. 

- These are my unbiased opinion. I am entitled to have one and you may also have but let's just respect each other's opinion.",0,2016-05-10T15:45:55Z

@JD-fz3hy,"Honestly, I don't like this song. I liked it because Tiffany's vocal performance is so good and the visuals are nice but this track really underlies for me the issue which SM and the K-Pop industry has with female singers. This sounds like something I would have heard a decade ago on the radio, its not current at all. The songs which many Korean girl groups sing are far too safe and just not experimental enough, in the end they all start to sound a bit the same. Of course there are exceptions, I Got A Boy and Catch Me If You can were both unexpected in the ways they pushed new ground for GG. This song does nothing new though. GIVE ME DIFFERENT, GIVE ME NEW, GIVE ME FRESH.",1,2016-05-10T15:42:25Z
@Edenville,AESTHETIC AF! I really love the mv and the song! really tiffany I knew she wouldn't disappoint us at all. She said in the vapp that the message is that you can dance if you want to just do it and have fun. This is for whoever says tiffany is talentless and can't dance or even sing.. well here you go she's gonna slay all of us! Lastly I'm really proud she's finally doing what she loves because the album as a whole not only the title track is so her style and I'm so very super happy for her!!!!!! BABY TIFFANY EVERYONE IS PROUD OF YOU AND WE LOVE YOU 💖💖💖💖💖,1,2016-05-10T15:42:24Z

It does feel a bit generic and underwhelming though, the chorus is all that I can remember the 1st time round - which I don't find too catchy.

@tigerlilyem-o9s,"Wow! This is probably not the type of song that a lot of sones usually listen to. This is definitely another level, in a positive way! This song needs a deeper understanding of music genres and quality. This is not probably catchy to some people, but if you listen to it well, though, you'll realize how good the quality of the music is. The vocal is amazing, too! Looks like that Fany has worked hard to improve her vocal and singing technique. I think this is the message that Tiffany wants to convey. She wants to deliver a quality music, the kind of song and genre she likes. She is being honest to herself. She wants to show her color and taste. If that's actually the case, I think Tiff did a great job! Well done and good luck, Love! For the fans, please take some times to enjoy this moment and appreciate her work. :)",1,2016-05-10T15:40:50Z
