@ca_xq4,"1. Saudi Arabia has become a key hub for K-pop: After events like KCON and concerts during Riyadh Season, it's clear that there is a huge and excited fanbase. Korean companies have started to notice this shift.


2. The Gulf fans have high energy: The support, organization, and fan engagement at concerts have become well-known, making performances in Saudi Arabia a unique experience for both the group and the fans.


3. Strategic location: Saudi Arabia has become a central point between Asia and Europe, making it an ideal stop on a global tour.


4. A chance to create a historical moment: Since this would be LE SSERAFIM's first global tour, adding Saudi Arabia to the lineup would mean their first-ever appearance here, and that alone would make the event historic for both the fans and the group.

Here in Saudi Arabia, we love you deeply. We follow your journey, sing along to your songs, and dream of the day we get to see you live. Your music inspires us, your strength empowers us, and your message of confidence truly touches our hearts.
Every day, we wish to see you on stage in front of us, to share the love and cheers you truly deserve. Your visit wouldn’t just be a concert — it would be a dream come true and a memory we’d treasure forever.
Please come to Saudi Arabia and let us experience that special moment together. We’re ready to welcome you with endless love and warmth.
WE WANT LE SSERAFIM IN SAUDI ARABIA.
With all our love,
Your loyal fans.""",0,2025-04-19T18:07:45Z

@chsgymnast6698,I'm very pleased that the choreo looks exactly how I think the song sounds. Choreographer understood the assignment and lsf delivered !!,265,2025-04-19T12:27:24Z
@lak6569,"한발 앞서가는 르세라핌.
Ash는 HOT과 COME OVER과 차별화 된 장르로 생각했는데 댄스는 큰차이가 없어 보인다. 내가 볼 줄몰라서 그런건지도 모르겠지만, 아쉬운 감이 있다.
ASH는 피어리스를 잇는 르세라핌의 정체성 같은 곡같았다.",0,2025-04-19T12:26:35Z
