@ms.d88,"Now I understand why Hoshi chose Getting Closer as the song with a harder choreo when the Performance Unit was asked which song had a more difficult choreography (choosing between HIT and Getting Closer). Focus on him. Even from the start, he already has the most difficult position and then he travels from left to right then front to back. And have you noticed how he has that position from 0:33 then suddenly stands up and moves to his right and then center to do his part of the song (exactly from 0:33-0:38)? That takes a lot of energy and focus. Look at how he travels backwards from in front to the back at 2:09 to 2:13. That's amazing especially if you have a lot of members in a group. You need to be mindful of the formation while moving. He is indeed the Performance Unit leader and the main dancer. Also, I appreciate how DINO was giving his all in this choreography video. They were all giving their 100% but Dino caught my attention too. He was giving his 200% here. Kudos Seventeen!!!!",0,2023-08-05T04:36:45Z

@Sebisajiminstan,"This remains one of my favorite choreos ever. From them or anyone else. It is so pleasing to the eye, they are so perfectly in sync with each other and the beat, and the formations and transitions are INSANE. There is absolutely no one who can challenge Seventeen in terms of choreography, period.
It’s not just cause they have a lot of members either, it’s cause they know how to use that to create something spectacular. Like, I was looking at NCT’s performances, and they have almost double the people on stage, but their performances are always lacking and disconnected. They do not use the potential of having 20+ people at all. 
Look at SVT’s formations, at any point during this song. They are always interesting to look at, and they manage to keep the transitions flawless as well. There’s no awkwardly standing by in position, waiting for the beat, there’s no pause, the member leaving center stage is already in the middle of a move, as is the member now taking the center. And everyone else is always moving. And the freaking levels? During this whole performance? Mindblowing. Especially Woozi’s verse, Hoshi’s chorus part and Wonwoo’s at the end. 
I could talk about this choreo for hours, it’s so well made and executed. Brilliant.",32,2022-05-26T20:58:01Z

I used to think that my memory isn't good and was scared that I could never succeed in med school with its heavy memorization. But now, becoming a Carat gave me so much confidence. Seventeen is one of the biggest groups in kpop. From not being able to tell Jeonghan and Joshua apart, I can bravely say I can distinguish them in the dark by just their cough. Not only do I remember how many siblings each of them have, but I also remember their full name lineup forward and backward, GoSe iconic lines, the location of their beauty marks, their food allergy, their habits, and quirks, and other 100+ TMI they said before. Memorizing a thousand body parts and functions would not be any more difficult than memorizing facts about Seventeen x 7-years-worth of information about them x their lifespan info so far. 

Being a carat really boosted my confidence a lot. I'm ready for med school!",0,2022-04-26T14:36:29Z

@danejuna,They move as one and so unselfishly that it’s difficult for one person to stand out. They all look amazing on stage. And the way they are so in sync just shows you how attuned they are to one another. It’s like each member can sense every members’ movement and moves accordingly.

@rin_box,"I love Seventeen, I really do... but since we're stuck in quarantine, I keep on wishing they'd release more lives of the b-sides... We're spoiled already, I know, 2 comebacks in Japan and Korea in 2020, and the masterpiece that is An Ode last year... but I can't understand why songs like Network Love, Lie Again, I Wish, and Kidult haven't been performed live yet. The titles this year,  Left & Right and Homerun are amazing we need positivity to survive this pandemic... Still, I wish they'd also perform all the age-line songs and All My Love (which has the same dramatic lyrics as DWC). Personally though, my all-time fave Semicolon song is Light A Flame, and right after they have a 96line perf, can they please perform it as OT13??  

... which is why I'm looking forward to the year-end shows... I don't care about the awards (I'm still voting, ofc!), all the hype & glory could go to BTS and Blackpink, I'll shrug it off... BUT the Korean public, and the rest of the Kpop world, are missing out on Seventeen's amazing lives. I don't even mean risky formations or exhausting choreography. They're already acknowledged as the best & most synchronized dance group in South Korea. I wish for lives when they'd just sit, sing/rap, and let the songs and their voices + visuals  shine through.",0,2020-11-09T17:20:20Z

like i don't see the point when fans fight or even hate on a group cuz it won, like remember they didn't win for nothing or to piss you off, they won because they deserved it and recieved that award after effort, pain, hardships, sickness and even intense injuries

@8BCA84,"lemme just point a few things:

1) the formations and transitions are amazing. it’s already hard enough to place certain arrangements w many members (trust me, the struggle is real. i rmb drawing too many circles just for the formation itself and had too many corrections for the transition) but this is what makes svt really unique. they made use of their number and made it as their strength. 

2) i could roughly imagine the amount of practice that was poured into this choreography like any of their songs. to be that synchronized, they must have done this a lot. every move ingrained in their muscle memory.

3) in a kpop, it’s difficult to form a group with similar style of dancing but svt is once again, different. the feel for each member connects w another member that connects to another and that makes this team solid asf. almost like they audition for the same troop w the same genre. that’s the reason why you struggle to find the main dancer or perf. team or can’t focus on one person because you have to look at the piece as a whole to appreciate it more. 

4) lastly, it’s not much noticeable but i like the fact they adjust accordingly to their position whenever they feel like they’re out of the formation. One example of this would be Hoshi adjusting to S. Coups kick in 1:28 because as SC cannot exactly look back to check if he’s going to hit HS, the other must condition himself to avoid accidents as such. another would be Dino stepping back in 2:30. one trait of being a good dancer in a group is becoming aware of his members, conscious or not. 

i can’t believe i typed this long but truly, svt is one hardworking unit. they deserve every award there is. i am saying this as someone who has an experience in dancing so pls excuse me if i over analyze a detail or two.",12,2019-09-15T17:43:45Z

@ohyesmmmhmisssharon2358,"You can't really expect less from this group. The best in dancing! And so flawless much smoother than your face!(jk lol)

I've never really seen anyone do this so might as well do it:

Why they're the best? Cuz they make the cleanest dance. Which is very difficult to achieve btw if you're dancing in a group this big. How do you think they made it clean? Through proper execution. Like if you gotta bend your knees 90 degrees you gotta do it at 90. No more no less. That's the very basic principle in dancing to avoid clutter especially if you're dancing in a group. As dancer myself, the actions their doing are actually simple if you slowed it down. What made it difficult tho is cuz of the tempo. It's fast and if you're a dancer of only one genre then this is gonna be real difficult to you (when I transitioned from contemporary to pop I was having massive difficulty cuz of the difference but luckily I was able to get it down quicker than contemporary). Again what made it beautiful tho despite the simplicity is the execution. They did it PERFECTLY. Now in the dancing world there's a saying, ""Simple and clean is ALWAYS better."" Cuz it's hard to nail clean in difficult actions such as acrobats incorporated in the dance. If you've watched a lot of choreography and if you're a dancer you'll understand what I meant.

Now to those who wanted to cover this and already covered this but meh: 
Take note you gotta execute this properly. You gotta bend, reach, kneel, bounce and jump according to the choreography. DO NOT overdo it or you'll destroy the dance and practice countless times to nail down the beat. You'll notice big change in your dancing if you do this two. Looking cool and sexy is the least of your concern. You'll look much cooler and sexier if you dance properly. Remember that execution is everything to emphasize the dance, creativity always comes second.

And please spare me the lesson about you dancing this in your own style. Being lazy in following proper execution is not a ""style"", you're just lazy. Notice how a lot of people do the same dance but in their own style. Did they slack off? Nooooo they still execute it properly and beautifully. They just added a few flicks and twists of here and there to make it their own.",4,2019-07-30T17:42:11Z

@sherinalorenzo,This part of the song 1:00 shows how much seventeen trusts each other. I mean you need to jump into your position with a big arm swing. One wrong position and you could literally hit someone so hard. And that is very crucial. It takes a lot of trust to do it without hesitation that you might hit someone. There is trust that each member is doing their part in the choroeo. Kudoooos!!,0,2019-01-03T19:24:24Z

The absolute synchronized moves, the use of one member to move the others around, and the level changes in the first 20 seconds alone are amazing. And the chorus?

@mazadraniya2066,"Really, imo this performance is beyond amazing. Not because it's a dark concept, not because it's hip hop. But because this song really showcase their talents and cooperation, either as individual, or as a whole. This song has a hardcore rap, synchronize choreography and powerful vocal. And they nailed this song with THAT much energy. This is why Seventeen is one of the kind. They are special and unique. They really apply their motto ""Seventeen's Brand is Seventeen"". I know these days they're underappreciated, but I'm sure there will be time they'll get recognize for their hardwork. Keep rising and let's have a memorable 2019, Seventeen and Carats! ♥️",1,2018-12-30T04:07:44Z

Hello, everyone. For their net profit, the Fledis, the agency of SEVENTEEN, is uploading the video by integrating the account with other groups.Please use V-app.(Please copy this one.)/(I only like SEVENTEEN, and even if I'm a Korean, I might be wrong because I'm a translator. I'm really sorry about this.)

안녕하세요 여러분 지금 현재 세븐틴의 소속사인 플래디스가 자신들의 순수익을 위해서 세븐틴 계정에 영상을 올리지않고 다른 그룹과 계정 통합을 해서 영상을 올리고 있습니다.최대한 브이앱을 통하여 덕질을 해주시기 부탁드립니다.(이글을 복사해서 널리널리 퍼트려주세요)/(제가 오직 세븐틴을 좋아하는 것으로만 한국인 임에도 번역기로 해서 틀릴수도 있습니다. 이점 정말 죄송합니다)",2,2018-12-29T23:48:34Z

@Syndromed99,"One of my favourite things about SVT as a group is the way they so skillfully utilise their numbers in the choreographing aspect of their songs.
Because SVT has more members than the average Kpop group (which has, on average, around 7 members -- that's nearly HALF of what SVT has) choreos can quickly become crowded or start to look messy if they're not handled well. However, SVT has consistently resisted that issue and shown choreos that are beautiful and intricate BECAUSE of the large numbers instead of DESPITE the large number of members. 

For example, around 1:38 when the members are lined up and do this slow motion, sort of...unfolding(?) move with their arms and bodies -- I replayed that part multiple times because it was so strangely entrancing. The reason a move like that works so well is because they have so many members, but the large amount of members also make moves like that difficult, because if even one of them is a little off on their timing, it messes up the flow and aesthetic of the move completely.  And yet, they pull it off beautifully AND they quickly transition from that slower move to a faster more powerful one in the span of like 1 second, which is hard as hell to do in small numbers, let alone with THIRTEEN people.

So what I'm saying is: STAN TALENT, STAN SEVENTEEN.

,"This videos, this song for me is the translation of so much hard work, team work, patience, confidence, courage, potential, talent, believe, love, blood, tear, sweat. After so many incredible songs, concepts and choreographys that had us amazed, and with higher and higher expectations, Seventeen come, just when the year is about to end and we all didn't expected nothing more, and give us this woderful piece of work.  Gosh!! verything here is so soooooo impressive, spetacular that I have to give all the congratualations to this incredible team, my 13 boys that i love and cherish and admire so dearly, who never fail to make me laugh, smile, feel that i'm part of this family, that i'm special and friends with each one of them just for being a carat. But mostly Seventeen never fails in show to the world the results of giving them a chance, QUALITY WORK, QUALITY MUSIC, TRULY ARTIST. Kind and inocent hearts, but also brave. 

Thank you so much, my 13 diamonds, for show me that hard work paids off, tallent always needs to be molded, together we get more, we are better than alone, and to believe in my dreams, that starts hard, from the bottom, but live your life doing what you love makes all the difference. 

I'm sorry the loong comment. I just love this boys so much and needed to tell somehow.",58,2018-12-29T21:48:38Z

I can't believe how well they all fit together, even though there's 13 of them, and they all have different personalities and styles. It's just genius.
Also this choreo looks hella exhausting.

It's just so intricate and so sync, it keeps you intrigued for days.  I love all the formations, and how it highlights everyone.  I've seen sideview pov of this dance, and even then its still interesting.  SVT definitely knows how to use their large group to their advantage in choreography.  I love the layers and symmetry.

@hoshifiziert5019,"Theory time: I know thats Kind of stange but I think there i someone who kills the members. If you look at the teaser of the concerts it looks like a Police/Mafia theme. In one Video it looks like the Vocal unit is the Police that tryes to find out who Killed Seungkwan. They Talk to the Hip hop unit (They are on on table and their Hands are tied to the table with handcuffs). In YMMD Oh My! They are in Heaven but befor that (Prequel from YMMD: Getting Closer) they needed to fear because of the ""killer"". They now Death is getting closer, the Killer is getting closer. Again it looks like two are the police. This time Dino and Hoshi with their Flashlights. The Clooks could be the time till they all were dead(? Not sure about that). Now the Best part. The Killer is wonwoo! Why? Easy, everyone was talking about that wonwoo always has the ending part. In thanks, flower ect. He is again the ending fairy. He Stands out. I think thats a hint that Wonwoo is different from the others in the Story. He is the one who killed everyone. (Idk if everyone is dead but coups diffently xD.) That makes sence because the Vocal unit only talked to the HipHop Unit about seungkwan. 

To the Video: I love the choreography. I like Woozis part and the beginning with hoshi. He looks like a Tiger and it makes me go CRAZY. I love you seventeen! ♡",0,2018-12-29T10:37:33Z

@_ACCOUNT_CONFLICT

숨이 차 가사영상을 보고 뮤비를 보러 가시기 전 알아주길 바랍니다. 먼저 세븐틴이 데뷔하기 전, 추억이 담긴 영상들이 가득한 세븐틴 유튜브 계정이 있고 여태껏 그 계정을 통해 티저, 뮤비를 공개해왔습니다. 그런데 플레디스 계정에 세븐틴, 뉴이스트 W, 프리스틴 모든 계정들을 합친다는 것에 의해서 지금 캐럿분들은 뮤비를 혐오쪽으로 신고하여 영상이 삭제되게끔 하는 중입니다. 

그러므로 다들 V앱을 통해서 뮤비를 봐주시길 바랍니다 !

I hope you know before you go to watch the music video after watching the movie. Before SEVENTEEN made her debut, she had a YouTube account full of videos of her memories. She's been showing her teaser and music videos. But by combining all the accounts of SEVENTEEN, NU'EST W and PRISTIN, CARATs are now reporting the music to the abomination side so that the video can be deleted. doing it. 

So please watch the music video through V app!",0,2018-12-29T09:22:28Z

@jchen8902,Seventeen is one of the best dance groups in all of the K-pop industry. I can name a few others that are really as good as Seventeen in terms of choreo and sheer skill but Seventeen's synchro tops all other groups. You don't even see this kind of group dance in professional dancers or any other idols because Seventeen really has their teamwork down till the point where it seems like they're one person.,172,2018-12-29T06:52:37Z

@sissymayemaye,"Hoshi, I...I seriously don't know how you do this. The monster choreo that comes out of this man, it's truly scary. THIS....THIS is what is always brewing in Hoshi's head, people. The man literally eats, sleeps, and breathes dancing 24/7 and barely gets any sleep because THIS is what he's coming up with in his brain. I get exhausted just thinking about what he has to come up with on the daily. Hoshi has to create AND REMEMBER 13 separate choreographies in his head at all times. He has to know what EVERYONE'S steps are, including his own, so he can teach AND monitor the progress of each member. All this while being the happy mood maker of the group, AND dancing so hard to his OWN choreography, that he constantly POPS HIS SHOULDER OUT OF JOINT!! This choreo had me a nervous wreck that his shoulder was going to go out on him again, but there he was, just a poppin and lockin and not even thinking about it. This man is truly amazing (slow claps). By his own admission he can be quick-tempered at times, but can you really blame him? THIS!! THIS SICK, MONSTER, MADDENING AWARD WINNING CHOREO IS IN HIS HEAD ALL THE TIME!! I'm telling you people, Qwon Soon Young is scary.

Again, my opinion think what you want to think. I just really like him he works really hard. So do the other members of course Woozi especially I freaking love him too but it’s just nice to see how much not only Joshua but all of them have improved over the past couple years.

@wilfygloutonny,"One of the things I like a lot about large groups in k-pop it’s the way they switch the center dancer — and Seventeen it’s one of the best groups to pull that off. I know my opinion may be biased, but really. This guys have a monster coordination and are great dances, not only on solo, but also as a team. They dance as a whole, making one go to the center (usually when they have a their line) and then mixing it with the background as a ‘back-up dancer’. You really can notice that all 13 of them are necessary to make this choreography, and non of their moves are random. Every little detail it’s thought with delicacy. Really, this guys amaze me even more every comeback. Go SVT! 💎",534,2018-12-29T04:41:55Z

@kgaming3661,"Hi there carats, new fan here lol I saw them tweet the video and came to watch and loved it. so I've been meaning to get into SVT for a while and when Getting Closer dropped I thought it'd be a perfect time bc I loooved the song, one of my favorite bg releases of the year. anyway what would you guys recommend for a new fan? I know their other title tracks like Clap, Thanks, DWC, Mansae and Nice so I'm not entirely new but I've never really paid much attention beyond the music.. what variety shows or videos etc would you recommend to get to know them? although 13 seems like a large number but.. sigh. also, what are some bsides you guys would recommend? They seem to have a very good balance between their vocals and their rapping & I love that and want more songs like this one (btw W H O sings that falesetto @ 2:06??) I love bgs like shinee exo and mx so.. yeah I feel like svt are on-par with them. sorry for the long paragraph btw x love",7,2018-12-29T04:10:47Z

@magroves,"I am constantly amazed by these 13 young men, their hard work, their dedication, their talent, and their good looks.  

Their dancing is so powerful and synchronized, the music is always interesting and well performed.  Voices like Seungkwans and DK.  Dancing like Jun, Hoshi, Dino and Minghao.  

Woozi is such a good composer.  Hoshi is such a great choreographer and they always fit the songs. I love that so much of the creative process comes right from the group. 

And personalities like DK's sunshine, Hoshi's passion, Seungkwan's friendliness, Woozi's practicality, Vernon's free spirit, Wonwoo's emo side, Mingyu taking care of everyone, Jeonghan being a jokester, and Coup's warm teddy bear side just make me so glad I stan them.

Mingyu wearing mg favorite shirt for him. Baby your showing too much of your chest 😭
Deokyeom your powerful vocal you hoe. The falsetto, shyt. 
Kwanie blue hair suits you and my ears have been blessed again. Im crying.

And I must commend Seokmin and Boo as early as now. This is another strong choreography and their vocals will again be put to a test when performed live. But I’m pretty sure they’ll be able to do it, just like how they’re doing it when dancing to “Call, Call, Call” and the likes. 👏🏼",0,2018-12-29T03:52:57Z

@silverdeer4876,"Whoever the choreographer may be(hoshi's team or if they have a normal choreographer), he/she was smart to include some places where they do nothing/minimal movement such as bouncing slightly or standing still in the last chorus. I'm glad they didnt overestimate the boys' stamina and make them dance explosively without stopping for a few moments. While they may have a lot of energy, power, or stamina, this is one of(maybe their most) their most powerful dances that I've seen so far.
It's very well made, and synchronized. They deserved to win best male dance award at MAMAs this year.",0,2018-12-29T03:36:04Z

@AWEsome3GIRl3sam,Idk why but when I watch other groups with 10+ members I'd usually think their choreos look overcrowded or messy but with svt everything is so neat and pleasing to the eye. At first I thought it was bc I'm a carat and I just know the members better svts choreos look better but now I see its bc svt always has such even position distribution and smooth formation changes. They dont have every member follow the exact same movements or try to make every member visible which I think makes the choreos look cleaner. Each member has their own specific part that creates a balance which I love. The boys have definitely made their large group  size their advantage when it comes to their choreos 💕💓💕💞💅🏾,122,2018-12-29T03:31:43Z
