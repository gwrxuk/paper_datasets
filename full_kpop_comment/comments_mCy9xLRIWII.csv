@Zozozzzzz323,"First, congrats on your solo album, Taeyong!
Second,
Hello, the COVER ""认真的雪” by your company's artist Huang Renjun uploaded by the official NCT account on Bilibili (Chinese Video platform) suddenly failed. It is no longer showing on Bilibili. The number of views of this cover has exceeded 1.1 million--please confirm with the platform as soon as possible, and quickly process and restore the video. While restoring the video, please check with Bilibili to recover the playback, barrage, and comments. After inquiring Bilibili, we Chinese fans learned that the appeal time is only 15 days--that is to say, if the uploader does not deal with the video failure in time, this cover will be forever lost on Bilibili after JUNE 20TH. Please handle it as soon as possible. Huang Renjun is a rising artiat. We fans hope that his company can pay more attention to these type of problems. For the past few days, a large number of Chinese fans have been trying to contact SM Entertainment and NCT over platforms like Weibo, asking them to resolve the video issue. Although we fans also know that the company is busy with many important comebacks during this period of time, but the recovery time of this cover is urgent, so please deal with it as soon as possible. Thank you very much!

P.S. If you are a NCTzen, Please try to contact or message SM or NCT over different platforms. The more fans that bring up this issue, the earlier It gets resolved. We all wish the best for all NCT members. No member's hardwork and popularity should be affected by technical issues like this. 
Below is the link to Bilibili. If you search up ""Renjun"" in NCT's video content, you will see that Renjun's cover of ""认真的雪” is missing.
