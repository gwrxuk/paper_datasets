@resogress1467,"우리의 밤은 셀 수 없는
별들과 모래알 그 사이
폭죽을 쏘는 탕탕 소리에
우리의 웃음꽃 피우고

저 멀리 달빛 우리의 조명이 되고
스치는 바람 내게서 네게로 번져서 갈 때에
눈물은 다 사라져 가네

사라져 가네 우리 뒷모습이
두 손을 꽉 쥔 채 노을이 진
깜깜한 하늘 별들만
가득 채워진 채 우릴 비춰주길

해가 떠오를 때까지 ah
우린 계속 타오르지 ah
미소를 머금고 이 순간에
설렘을 너에게 바톤터치

우리의 새벽은 낮보다 뜨거워
아침이 올 때까지

Oh, summer, summer, summer, summer, oh
여름밤에 우리를 새기고
Oh, summer, summer, summer, summer, oh
다시 찾아올 그땐 어떨까?

Oh-oh, oh-oh
그땐 어떨까
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
그땐 어떨까

모두 잠든 밤 이리 아름다운가
달빛을 담아낸 너의 미소가
어두운 밤을 빛내 파도 같은 웃음소리
귀를 간지럽혀

전부 벗어나 into the wild
그들의 기준에 부합하지 마 이 시간을
우리의 새벽은 더 뜨겁고
날이 밝으면 the world is ours

저 멀리 불빛 우리의 추억이 되고
넘치는 파도 그 아래 남겨둔 우리 글씨에
서로의 이름을 새기며

우리의 새벽은 낮보다 뜨거워
아침이 올 때까지

Oh, summer, summer, summer, summer, oh
여름밤에 우리를 새기고
Oh, summer, summer, summer, summer, oh
다시 찾아올 그땐 어떨까?

Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
그땐 어떨까
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
그땐 그때

널 곁에 두고 아껴주고 사랑하고 oh
매일 웃어주고 지금처럼 아름답길

우리의 새벽은 낮보다 뜨거워
아침이 올 때까지
나의 마음은 낮보다 뜨거워
지금처럼 너에게

@_bbangjaehyun,"new carat here by the time I posted this comment, and I first heard this song on their dingo drinking content (the one where woozi and hoshi cried). The moment I heard this, I felt this pang on my chest I haven't felt in a while. It felt so nostalgic yet freeing. I'm so happy  I finally stanned them after 8 years kf being a casual listener cuz their songs are so good. I didn't find seventeen, They found me on one of my most mundane and darkest time of my life. :((( thank you svt for coming to my life. Cheers to forever :))",8,2023-08-16T17:49:42Z

별들과 모래알 그 사이
폭죽을 쏘는 탕탕 소리에
우리의 웃음꽃 피우고

저 멀리 달빛 우리의 조명이 되고
스치는 바람 내게서 네게로 번져서 갈 때에
눈물은 다 사라져 가네

사라져 가네 우리 뒷모습이
두 손을 꽉 쥔 채 노을이 진
깜깜한 하늘 별들만
가득 채워진 채 우릴 비춰주길

해가 떠오를 때까지 ah
우린 계속 타오르지 ah
미소를 머금고 이 순간에
설렘을 너에게 바톤터치

우리의 새벽은 낮보다 뜨거워
아침이 올 때까지

Oh, summer, summer, summer, summer, oh
여름밤에 우리를 새기고
Oh, summer, summer, summer, summer, oh
다시 찾아올 그땐 어떨까?

Oh-oh, oh-oh
그땐 어떨까
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
그땐 어떨까

모두 잠든 밤 이리 아름다운가
달빛을 담아낸 너의 미소가
어두운 밤을 빛내 파도 같은 웃음소리
귀를 간지럽혀

전부 벗어나 into the wild
그들의 기준에 부합하지 마 이 시간을
우리의 새벽은 더 뜨겁고
날이 밝으면 the world is ours

저 멀리 불빛 우리의 추억이 되고
넘치는 파도 그 아래 남겨둔 우리 글씨에
서로의 이름을 새기며

우리의 새벽은 낮보다 뜨거워
아침이 올 때까지

Oh, summer, summer, summer, summer, oh
여름밤에 우리를 새기고
Oh, summer, summer, summer, summer, oh
다시 찾아올 그땐 어떨까?

Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
그땐 어떨까
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
그땐 그때

널 곁에 두고 아껴주고 사랑하고 oh
매일 웃어주고 지금처럼 아름답길

우리의 새벽은 낮보다 뜨거워
아침이 올 때까지
나의 마음은 낮보다 뜨거워
지금처럼 너에게

제주 귀덕골방에 손님이 신청해주신 음악입니다.

음악은 추억이 아닐까요
누군가에 신청곡으로 첨 듣는 음악을 듣게 되고
어디선가 그음악을 또 듣게 되면
아! 골방에서 들었던 그노래

이런 추억을 다른이에게도 만들어주셨내요

누군가 듣고싶어 신청해주신 이노래를
만들어주신 작사,작곡, 편곡자분들과 불러주신 가수분에게 
정말 감사합니다.


제댓글이 많아 불편하셨다면 정말 죄송합니다.

하지만 제 댓글이 많다는건
이노래를 신청해주신 분들이 많다는거에요

그시간에 신청해주신 분이 이댓글을 보신다면
행복해 하실꺼라는걸 알거든요

그래서 신청곡이 들어올때마다 댓글을 남겨드리고 있어요

그시간에 소중한 신청곡 정말 감사합니다.

골방을 하면서 정말 모르고 있던
좋은 음악들을 많이 듣게되어 행복합니다.

@itsnotmeitsyou7394,"I saw a comment here some time ago asking why do Seventeen songs sound nostalgic even if it's their first time listening to it. 

Personally, I think it's because Seventeen's concept heavily relies on youth and growing up. They explicitly explore all phases of your youth from early adolescence until present day. They specifically lean into experiences of love - from having a crush to experiencing puppy love until it blooms to a mature one, even dealing with the toxicity and problems of relationships, which I think all of us had experienced once or twice. To make it better, Seventeen (most especially Woozi) knows how to capture the sound of innocence or torment or trauma in a song. You listen to a certain song and you'll definitely know what kind of emotion they're singing even without looking up the lyrics. 

What also adds to the nostalgic feeling is that Seventeen refuses to follow what's trendy but stick to what message they want to convey - which most likely be their hurdles, their thoughts during that particular phase in their life. Their songs are like journal entries of them growing up and we're blessed to be able to experience them through their songs.

EDIT: if any of you are interested in reading more svt stuff like this, i just started a blog at tumblr. it's basically just a compilation of stuff  like this  but much more elaborated and probably with pretty pictures haha Im kishirina there! let's meet and be friends pls",2496,2022-01-21T07:33:39Z

Oh Oh How will it be? Oh Oh Oh How will it be? When everyone’s asleep It’s so beautiful Your smile resembles the moonlight Your wave-like laughter brightens the night And tickles my ears Escape everything Into the wild Don’t conform to their standards Right now Our dawn is hotter than day When the day comes The world is ours The faraway light Becomes our memory Under the overflowing waves We leave our letters Engraving our names Our dawn is hotter than day Till morning comes Oh Summer Summer Summer Summer Oh Engraving ourselves on this summer night Oh Summer Summer Summer Summer Oh How will it be when it comes again? Oh Oh How will it be?

Immediately after the MV, I proceeded to this song. AND AGAIN, this guy with a whiTe loose shirt STOLE MY WHOLE ATTENTION.

THIS SONG REMINDS ME OF THE DAY I MET SVT IN THE SAEM FANSIGN I WAS LISTENING TO THIS SONG NON STOP WHILE IM ON MY WAY TO THE VENUE AND WHEN I SAW ALL THE BOYS IT MAKES ME CRY. I AM SOOOOOOOOOO HAPPY THAT I MET THESE GUYS. SO THANKFUL. I WISH I CAN ATTEND YOUR CONCERT FOR THE NEXT TIME. <33333,3,2021-10-11T02:55:29Z

@soobunniee2326,"back when i just started stanning them, i remember having an anxiety attack (triggered by some personal problems), i coudn't breathe well. i tried to relax and calm myself down while i keep watching this video over and over until my breathing came back to normal. idkw but there is just smthng in this song that calms me: their voices, the rhythm, the song itself, their dance, and just everything. And that was the exact moment when i realize that they are really my home and comfort. ♡ 
and now whnvr i am having anxiety, getting stressed out, or simply having a bad day, this song, or this video in general, never disappoints to comfort me.",54,2021-10-10T18:13:20Z

[SK] 여름밤에 
우리를 새기고
[VN/DN] Oh Summer Summer 
Summer Summer Oh
[WZ] 다시 찾아올 
그땐 어떨까?

[T8] Oh Oh
그땐 어떨까
[JH] Oh Oh Oh
그땐 어떨까

[SC] 모두 잠든 밤
이리 아름다운가
달빛을 담아낸 너의 미소가
어두운 밤을 빛내 파도 
같은 웃음소리
귀를 간지럽혀

[VN] 전부 벗어나
Into the wild
그들의 기준에 부합하지 마
이 시간을
우리의 새벽은 더 뜨겁고
날이 밝으면
The world is ours

[DN] 저 멀리 불빛
우리의 추억이 되고
[SK] 넘치는 파도
그 아래 남겨둔 우리 글씨에
서로의 이름을 새기며

[T8/ALL] 우리의 새벽은 
낮보다 뜨거워
아침이 올 때까지

[WW/MG] Oh Summer Summer 
Summer Summer Oh
[DK] 여름밤에 
우리를 새기고
[WW/MG] Oh Summer Summer 
Summer Summer Oh
[WZ] 다시 찾아올 
그땐 어떨까?

[JN] Oh Oh
그땐 어떨까
[HS] Oh Oh Oh
그땐 그때

[JS] 널 곁에 두고
아껴주고
사랑하고 Oh

[WZ] 매일 웃어주고
지금처럼
아름답길

[SC/ALL] 우리의 새벽은 
낮보다 뜨거워
아침이 올 때까지

[JH/ALL] 나의 마음은 
낮보다 뜨거워
지금처럼 너에게

[ALL] Oh Oh Oh",1,2021-08-19T11:49:03Z

@ella-12-345,"우리의 밤은 셀 수 없는
별들과 모래알 그 사이
폭죽을 쏘는 탕탕 소리에
우리의 웃음꽃 피우고

저 멀리 달빛 우리의 조명이 되고
스치는 바람 내게서 네게로 번져서 갈 때에
눈물은 다 사라져 가네

사라져 가네 우리 뒷모습이
두 손을 꽉 쥔 채 노을이 진
깜깜한 하늘 별들만
가득 채워진 채 우릴 비춰주길

해가 떠오를 때까지 ah
우린 계속 타오르지 ah
미소를 머금고 이 순간에
설렘을 너에게 바톤터치

우리의 새벽은 낮보다 뜨거워
아침이 올 때까지

Oh, summer, summer, summer, summer, oh
여름밤에 우리를 새기고
Oh, summer, summer, summer, summer, oh
다시 찾아올 그땐 어떨까?

Oh-oh, oh-oh
그땐 어떨까
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
그땐 어떨까

모두 잠든 밤 이리 아름다운가
달빛을 담아낸 너의 미소가
어두운 밤을 빛내 파도 같은 웃음소리
귀를 간지럽혀

전부 벗어나 into the wild
그들의 기준에 부합하지 마 이 시간을
우리의 새벽은 더 뜨겁고
날이 밝으면 the world is ours

저 멀리 불빛 우리의 추억이 되고
넘치는 파도 그 아래 남겨둔 우리 글씨에
서로의 이름을 새기며

우리의 새벽은 낮보다 뜨거워
아침이 올 때까지

Oh, summer, summer, summer, summer, oh
여름밤에 우리를 새기고
Oh, summer, summer, summer, summer, oh
다시 찾아올 그땐 어떨까?

Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
그땐 어떨까
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
그땐 그때

널 곁에 두고 아껴주고 사랑하고 oh
매일 웃어주고 지금처럼 아름답길

우리의 새벽은 낮보다 뜨거워
아침이 올 때까지
나의 마음은 낮보다 뜨거워
지금처럼 너에게

But I guess even if I can't meet you everyday or talk to you but you still always brought a sense of happiness and comfort in my life... You always make my day the brightest... I feel the sincere message everytime I listen to your music... I love you my brothers... As a single girl child I sometimes feel the need for a big bro... When other people talk about their siblings, l just feel a little jealous... But now that I have you all, not just one but THIRTEEN BIG BROS... I can proudly say that I have 13 brothers and my CARAT FAMILY to always comfort me, make me laugh and sometimes even cry because of their sincere feelings...My 13 Diamond Brothers... I love you~ 
Thank you for helping me in my hard times... Seranghe~

@micahthelibra,I just want to share what I always noticed in this video at their choreography at 1:54 Idk if someone already explained this or if this is really the meaning of it but look at how the members formed a sign of Seventeen however there was a one part that is incomplete but suddenly The8 pops out and the sign was formed completely. It just shows how The8 was really meant to be in Seventeen considering that he was the last one to complete the group. This little detail from the choreo melts my heart TT^TT,3059,2021-01-27T00:24:15Z

@뭐하냐-t1r,"우리의 밤은 셀 수 없는

별들과 모래알 그 사이

폭죽을 쏘는 탕탕 소리에

우리의 웃음꽃 피우고

저 멀리 달빛

우리의 조명이 되고

스치는 바람

내게서 네게로 번져서 갈 때에

눈물은 다 사라져 가네

사라져 가네 우리 뒷모습이

두 손을 꽉 쥔 채 노을이 진

깜깜한 하늘 별들만 가득 채워진 채

우릴 비춰주길

해가 떠오를 때까지 ah

우린 계속 타오르지 ah

미소를 머금고 이 순간에

설렘을 너에게 바톤터치

우리의 새벽은 낮보다 뜨거워

아침이 올 때까지

Oh Summer Summer Summer Summer Oh

여름밤에 우리를 새기고

Oh Summer Summer Summer Summer Oh

다시 찾아올 그땐 어떨까?

Oh Oh

그땐 어떨까

Oh Oh Oh

그땐 어떨까

모두 잠든 밤

이리 아름다운가

달빛을 담아낸 너의 미소가

어두운 밤을 빛내 파도 같은 웃음소리

귀를 간지럽혀

전부 벗어나

Into the wild

그들의 기준에 부합하지 마

이 시간을

우리의 새벽은 더 뜨겁고

날이 밝으면

The world is ours

저 멀리 불빛

우리의 추억이 되고

넘치는 파도

그 아래 남겨둔 우리 글씨에

서로의 이름을 새기며

우리의 새벽은 낮보다 뜨거워

아침이 올 때까지

Oh Summer Summer Summer Summer Oh

여름밤에 우리를 새기고

Oh Summer Summer Summer Summer Oh

다시 찾아올 그땐 어떨까?

Oh Oh

그땐 어떨까

Oh Oh Oh

그땐 그때

널 곁에 두고

아껴주고

사랑하고 Oh

매일 웃어주고

지금처럼

아름답길

우리의 새벽은 낮보다 뜨거워

아침이 올 때까지

나의 마음은 낮보다 뜨거워

지금처럼 너에게

I can’t explain how comforting this song is and just watching seventeen dance to it brought tears to me",23,2020-08-13T22:54:59Z

별들과 모래알 그 사이

폭죽을 쏘는 탕탕 소리에
우리의 웃음꽃 피우고

저 멀리 달빛
우리의 조명이 되고
스치는 바람
내게서 네게로 
번져서 갈 때에
눈물은 다 사라져 가네

사라져 가네 우리 뒷모습이 
두 손을 꽉 쥔 채 노을이 진
깜깜한 하늘 별들만 
가득 채워진 채
우릴 비춰주길

해가 떠오를 때까지 ah
우린 계속 타오르지 ah
미소를 머금고 이 순간에
설렘을 너에게 바톤터치

우리의 새벽은 낮보다 뜨거워
아침이 올 때까지

Oh Summer Summer 
Summer Summer Oh
여름밤에 우리를 새기고
Oh Summer Summer 
Summer Summer Oh
다시 찾아올 그땐 어떨까?

Oh Oh
그땐 어떨까
Oh Oh Oh
그땐 어떨까

모두 잠든 밤
이리 아름다운가
달빛을 담아낸 너의 미소가
어두운 밤을 빛내 
파도 같은 웃음소리
귀를 간지럽혀

전부 벗어나
Into the wild
그들의 기준에 부합하지 마
이 시간을
우리의 새벽은 더 뜨겁고
날이 밝으면
The world is ours

저 멀리 불빛
우리의 추억이 되고
넘치는 파도
그 아래 남겨둔 우리 글씨에
서로의 이름을 새기며

우리의 새벽은 낮보다 뜨거워
아침이 올 때까지

Oh Summer Summer 
Summer Summer Oh
여름밤에 우리를 새기고
Oh Summer Summer 
Summer Summer Oh
다시 찾아올 그땐 어떨까?

Oh Oh
그땐 어떨까
Oh Oh Oh
그땐 그때

널 곁에 두고
아껴주고
사랑하고 Oh

매일 웃어주고
지금처럼
아름답길

우리의 새벽은 낮보다 뜨거워
아침이 올 때까지

나의 마음은 낮보다 뜨거워
지금처럼 너에게

@Noonym_not,"I now finally get how people can think that there is a lot of members.

The thing is that whenever I find a new group, the first thing I do is I count the members. Just the other day I found a new group and I was like WOAH there are so many members but after I counted them there were just 9...and then I went WOAH...there are somehow 4 more members in Seventeen...

Anyways, take it from a carat, you may find it overhelming now but after you get to know them you wouldn't be able to imagine Seventeen without any of it's 13 members. Give it a chance and you may just as well find you've fallen in love with these 13 crackheads.",1,2020-04-28T06:44:05Z

@aidaserzo1938,"Ive never thought that one day i will stan any kpop groups but when i heard one of their song that was played by my carat cousin  , I felt attached with it with no reasons , i dont know who are they , i dont know what is their group names , Ive never heard any thing about them compared to other known groups in our country. It all strated from one song that i played countless times. Whenever i watched any live shows of that song , i scroll down to the comments and their fans made me fell in love with them even more. Ever since that day I started to watched other songs made by SVT  and i hardly fell inlove more and more . I had realized that I came too late , and i should have know them earlier. There are still soooo many people who slept on SVT , and I dont know why, is it because there are too many ? Or is it because other groups are a lot more extra whenever they are in show and in front of camera and they seems so fake. 
I have chosen SVT not just because their songs were really really good but also because they show their real selves , you can see how their expressions were genuine and true. How precious they are when they smile and laugh.  SVT were also very lucky because of their fans . 

I am thanking Seventeen as well as my fellow carats. Thank you for getting me slipped to the diamond life. I would never ever regret it. Svt has become a big part of my life , they are the one who makes  me smile whenever im sad and they make me even happier when im in a good mood. Their awards and success was also my success. I just wish they know how much im proud of them .",217,2020-04-25T03:05:47Z

How do we say that? Maybe perhaps something like what seventeen perform is i think it's beautiful and seems emotional. That's what i think, they perform like that is the best -est they will ever did everytime. This is just my personal reference.

I know he stands out because he’s wearing full white but I’m asking about him cause I can see he is an exceptional dancer! His movements are very clean, open, and wide. I love it. I even replayed 20 times to look at all the members dancing at the chorus but I couldn’t find one compared to him. At 3:01 I admired him even more because he put his head down and no other member did when they dropped. It made his movement way more emphasized and eye catching. 1:03, he literally rocks his body and makes sure you can see it clearly! Also, who’s the one at 2:05, same thing goes for him too!

Before I heard it I thought it will be a fast and lively song but...it just bring me a little emotional...I scared before becuz every kpop group should have a song that is bad or awful. I scared 17 will be unperfect in my heart.

SEVENTEEN is really different from others groups. Even though they really don't have a song that will brainwashed a person by the first time from hearing it, but all of their songs are pleasant to hear. 

*SEVENTEEN never ever have a bad song or dance,they give their best to us.*

They are not the same, they do not even meet a slight resemblance. I think that if people listen to both carefully and with a good ear, he realizes the difference immediately, but of course, there are people who only seek to find fault with a great song like the one written by Lee Jihoon. I advise those who hear it similar, to be humble and accept that they do not have a good musical ear.",23,2018-12-03T04:08:10Z

@msmsmsms1,"I know this might be late but I just wanted to share you guys something. This song was played and covered by the members of the dance troop in our school. They used this as their intermission number of an event in our school. Most of the students in our school don’t really recognize this song by seventeen because it’s a side track and only few knew seventeen yet most of us(yes, including me) gets emotional, nostalgic, or whatsoever. It was aesthetic to look at especially they performed it at night with matching lights. Even it’s just a cover, all of us admit it that it was so beautiful. Even the teachers and staff in our school said so. Even the non-kpop fans, some asked me who sang that. Even the bashers(some), they said that it’s different from other kpop songs. To me, this song is for everyone, not just carats. I never knew that this would also affect to a non-fan or even a basher. This song is really— I can’t explain in words because there are no enough words to use to describe this masterpiece 😭💎

I almost forgot, my homeroom teacher also complimented them(seventeen) I forgot the exact words but it’s still the same 

“Who were the boys dancing to this? I dislike kpop but this might change my mind. Why this sounds so different from other kpop songs? The dance, too, is magnificent. It’s my first time listening to this but why I remembered the time I was young with my family staying on a beach house for a night. They are amazing, they can make people nostalgic. Haha” 

I forgot few of what my teacher said but to me, I couldn’t help but to be proud of seventeen because they literally conveyed and interpreted it well 😭",2264,2018-11-01T00:13:18Z

Always supporting you seventeen 💪😁 Be humble as always and give thanks to God for all the blessings you've received. And don't forget we're all human who sometimes get tired. Rest if needed but don't stop reaching your dreams. Always smile and keep safe😁😁😁,0,2018-09-25T16:52:46Z

@msmsmsms1,"For me, this video is breathtakingly beautiful. Just look at the light effects, the settings, and even their clothes. It’s too aesthetic that makes me a sobbing mess. This choreography they made, I don’t know how to explain but I don’t know any words to describe this kind of masterpiece. Most people are more on sharp and complex choreography but a choreography like this, which is graceful and elegant, is just on another level. I know we are amazed from other choreographies because they are sharp or complex but choreography like this is just so unique. It’s like telling you a story visually. If you translated this song in english, it shows that seventeen interpreted it mesmerizingly. Just by watching this video, it’s just so aesthetic and pleasing. It’s breathtaking. Choreography like this deserves more attention. I am really proud of seventeen for creating such a masterpiece 😭😭💎",721,2018-09-14T13:38:21Z

0:32 Don't Wanna Cry feels. T.T the reason it gives me feels is because DWC was the first song I've heard by them and how I became a Carat so that move is just like yesss.
0:38 this is my 4347583949x listening/watching this song and Wonwoo's part just gives me chills every time. heart eyes
1:34 look at rapper line go!! :')
1:59 cries
2:01 cries even more when the rest of the members pop out
2:44 I love this :')
3:07 i'm crying at how Seungkwan's expression went from laughing to serious in less than a second while S.Coups was still laughing the whole time lmao xD
3:22 this outro is everything where the right, left, and middle sides took turns waving bye to us, Carats. T.T <3

one thing I learned from this video: dance line who?? seems to me all thirteen of them should be in dance line instead of just four. they're honestly always in sync and never fails to amaze me. :))

@amirahamrinal2743,i swear this is by far the most beautiful choreography seventeen has ever made yet. everything about this is so ethereal. from the music to the choreography to the visuals. its absolutely so pleasing to watch. it amazes me how the choreo fits so well with the music and somehow tells the meaning behind the music and what they are trying to tell us if we look at it closely. i swear i love these boys so much and they always exceeds my expectations. i love stanning talented boys.,0,2018-09-02T03:42:46Z

@nayu7267,"The thing that is so captivating about Seventeen's choreographies is that even though they have way more than the standard number of members, they take advantage of the size of their group and make every single unit's movements count in their choreography. The flow of the place changes and small nuances in each member's movements altogether complete a fluid unit of movement that completes a picture that would look different if even one member were taken out. I can't think of any other kpop group that incorporates member placements and and group movement like Seventeen does.",506,2018-09-01T17:49:47Z

They are both good in musicality and artistry, they know their aesthetics, and they know exactly what goes well with what. Not only in this specific video but since day 1 of their debut (or even before their debut), all of their songs, music videos, choreography, and story.

@희희-i8s,"우리의 밤은 셀 수 없는

별들과 모래알 그 사이

폭죽을 쏘는 탕탕 소리에

우리의 웃음꽃 피우고

저 멀리 달빛

우리의 조명이 되고

스치는 바람

내게서 네게로 번져서 갈 때에

눈물은 다 사라져 가네

사라져 가네 우리 뒷모습이

두 손을 꽉 쥔 채 노을이 진

깜깜한 하늘 별들만 가득 채워진 채

우릴 비춰주길

해가 떠오를 때까지 ah

우린 계속 타오르지 ah

미소를 머금고 이 순간에

설렘을 너에게 바톤터치

우리의 새벽은 낮보다 뜨거워

아침이 올 때까지

Oh Summer Summer Summer Summer Oh

여름밤에 우리를 새기고

Oh Summer Summer Summer Summer Oh

다시 찾아올 그땐 어떨까?

Oh Oh

그땐 어떨까

Oh Oh Oh

그땐 어떨까

모두 잠든 밤

이리 아름다운가

달빛을 담아낸 너의 미소가

어두운 밤을 빛내 파도 같은 웃음소리

귀를 간지럽혀

전부 벗어나

Into the wild

그들의 기준에 부합하지 마

이 시간을

우리의 새벽은 더 뜨겁고

날이 밝으면

The world is ours

저 멀리 불빛

우리의 추억이 되고

넘치는 파도

그 아래 남겨둔 우리 글씨에

서로의 이름을 새기며

우리의 새벽은 낮보다 뜨거워

아침이 올 때까지

Oh Summer Summer Summer Summer Oh

여름밤에 우리를 새기고

Oh Summer Summer Summer Summer Oh

다시 찾아올 그땐 어떨까?

Oh Oh

그땐 어떨까

Oh Oh Oh

그땐 그때

널 곁에 두고

아껴주고

사랑하고 Oh

매일 웃어주고

지금처럼

아름답길

우리의 새벽은 낮보다 뜨거워

아침이 올 때까지

나의 마음은 낮보다 뜨거워

지금처럼 너에게

Oh Oh Oh
 Our nights are beyond count.

between the stars and the grains of sand

at the sound of the firecrackers

* Our laughter *

the distant moonlight

It becomes our lights.

a gust of wind

When I spread out from you

The tears are all gone.

They're disappearing.

yellowed

full of dark sky stars

Show us.

until the sun rises

We keep burning ah.

with a smile on one's face

Barton Touch

Our dawn is hotter than the day.

till morning

Oh Summer Summer Summer Oh

He carved us out on a summer night

Oh Summer Summer Summer Oh

What about when you come back?

Oh Oh Oh

What about then?

Oh Oh Oh Oh

What about then?

a sleepless night

How beautiful it is!

Your smile with the moonlight

a wave of laughter

with one's ears itchy

out of the box

Into the Wild

Don't meet their criteria.

at this time

Our dawn is hotter,

at daylight

The world is

a far-off light

Becoming our memory

a flood of waves

in the handwriting left behind

inscriptions of each other's names

Our dawn is hotter than the day.

till morning

Oh Summer Summer Summer Oh

He carved us out on a summer night

Oh Summer Summer Summer Oh

What about when you come back?

Oh Oh Oh

What about then?

Oh Oh Oh Oh

then

with you at your side

saving

Love and Oh

Smile every day

Like now

a beautiful road

Our dawn is hotter than the day.

till morning

My heart is hotter than the day.

To you like now

So much attention to detail and so much precision must be directed accordingly to give the correct feeling and message across to viewers, and that is exactly what Seventeen did here. It's this kind of dance that are so unforgettable and so memorable.",750,2018-08-31T03:47:06Z

@kristofferloistantano7801,"Okay hold up y'all this gonna be long. 

For a long time I've always wondered why no one can ever top Seventeen's dancing for me. There are a looot of artists in the kpop scene that are really good at dancing, but for some reason, for me, Seventeen stands on another level. So I thought about it, and the most accurate reason I could come up with is because Seventeen delivers art. No, I'm not saying it in a simple way, I'm saying Seventeen focuses and incorporates art on their dancing (from the formations to the transitions, from the precision of each step to the details of each minute movement, from both complexity and simpleness to the overall synchronization) - everything is on point. Seventeen dances gracefully. There is something in the way they move individually and as a group that is unlike any other. I can only explain this by saying that they have this aura of gentleness, even when they perform strong and powerful dances. I've noticed this ever since I saw their performance of Yuhaengga, where I realized the beauty in dancing slow songs, even if most of the movements are just walking.

I was once told of an experience when a fellow carat was watching a performance of Without You, and someone they know joined in watching the video and commented that it's not that good because SVT isn't energetic. I was about to lash at that story but I realized there was no point, because people have different tastes. See, what I've noticed on comments on many choreography videos, specially on boy group dances, is that most people equate power and the strength of dance moves to its awesomeness and difficulty. If it's fast, it's awesome. If there's a lot of movements, it's hard.  I love Without You's choreography very much, I can say that it's one of Seventeen's masterpieces. And here I would like to stress that slow movements comprised with gentle gestures and synchronized walking is just as powerful as strong, hiphop, or sexy choreos. 

And with the addition of Our Dawn Is Hotter Than Day, I cannot stress any stronger how creative Seventeen, most especially Hoshi and the rest of Performance Team really are. I love this choreo very much, from the movements during ""Oh oh, Oh oh"" to the way they showed farewell at the end. And the ""Oh Summer Summer Summer Summer"" part leaves me dazed. Whenever Seventeen performs, it is this gentleness that makes them stand out the most to me. Even in their powerful dances, especially Chuck, I can still see this sort of gentlemanliness in the way they carry the choreography. It makes me proud that they really carry their ""Kingsman"" vibe in every performance, and not just in No F.U.N., because that's how I see Seventeen: Kingsmen on their way to kill you with elegance through their performances. The way I see it, Seventeen focuses on the art itself, and not on the effect of art, when they dance.",491,2018-08-30T13:29:55Z
