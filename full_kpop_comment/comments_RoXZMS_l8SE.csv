However, while rewatching this episode, I accidentally opened the comments, and, as expected, it was the same story—people blaming Jeonghan and praising Mingyu for playing fair and square. No offense intended, Mingyu is also my bias. But when will people realize that this is all meant for entertainment? To me, it feels like something is missing when Jeonghan isn’t using his clever tactics.  
It’s disheartening to see everyone criticize him for playing these tricks, yet when their bias does something similar, they say things like, ""No wonder he’s SEVENTEEN,"" or ""He graduated from ‘HOW TO CHEAT UNIVERSITY OF JEONGHAN,’ I’m so proud of him."" It’s so hypocritical! Now where's the""fair and just"" You are talking about? The truth is, nothing in life is actually fair or just. People just tend to romanticize fairness when it suits their narrative but overlook it when it doesn't.

When the Hyungs formed alliance to cheat on Hoshi and his team. So frustrating.

Guys, friendly cheating is fun and nice when it's done occasionally but cheating in every single chance they have just to win? Come on.
That's why some fans are saying it's getting boring.

Where is the fun part in that?
Everything will just be too predictable. The ones who cheats are the ones wins and that's fun?

You are just defending your biases.
They don't think on bringing better entertainment, they just want to win.

Because if they do, they will play the game fair and square, and accept the results.
The satisfactory for the fans will be great in that way.
But no they cheats because they need to win ALL THE TIME. 😕

I hope the GoSe staffs will have stricter rules for games like this.
I was so pumped up in the 1st EP, now i cannot barely finish this EP.

Also, carats saying it's just a game chill. No it's not, haha! Jeonghan and S.coups' cheating just to win tells you this is NOT JUST a game for them. If this is just a game for them they should play along, but they knew Minyu was winning already so they cheated.",7,2024-07-24T05:20:54Z,,4

Come on! Don't fool yourself.

No matter how great the GoSe staff thinks of a new game concept, no matter how enjoyable they start the game, once the ones who always cheats started cheating the whole game is ruined because everything else from there is predictable.

Don't tell me that they're doing that for their fans.
Hahaha! This cheating issue has been a downplay for GoSe EPs for awhile even some members are complaining yet they're still doing it.

They're just too competitive and it's hard to watch.
What's the meaning of GoSe videos if they it will become like this.

동맹 맺어도 초반에 해야하는 심리전, 1등팀이 갑자기 칩 쓸어가는 거, 마지막 반전 보는 재미까지 있었을 텐데 그게 아쉬워요..

고잉뿐만 아니라 이런 심리전이나 두뇌게임 컨텐츠 좋아하는 사람으로서 각자가 열심히 해서 이기는 그림도 기특하고 한두번은 재밌겠지만, 이런 컨셉에서는 배신자가 모두를 속이고 이기는 그림이나 반칙과 동맹 속에서 결국 승리하는 언더독 그림이 제일 재밌다고 생각해요

그러려면 악역이 필요한데 역할 맡은 멤버들이 잘 해주고 있는 것 같고, 동맹 맺거나 반칙하는 것도 필요하고, 오히려 사기꾼캐, 정정당당캐 이렇게 캐릭터가 잡히면 서사 만들어지기 쉬워서 더 재밌는 것 같은데 캐럿들이 너무 욕하지 말았으면 좋겠어요.. 이미 한참 지났긴하지만..

이런 컨셉 더 해주면 좋겠는데 반응이 이런 식이면 앞으로 많이 못 나올 것 같아요ㅠㅠ 

한편으로는 정직이 보상 받지 못하는 것 같아서 속상해하는 캐럿들 마음도 이해가 돼요.. 멤버들을 단순하게 예능 플레이어로 보는 게 아니라 소중한 사람들로 생각하는 마음이겠죠?🥲

그렇지만 저같은 머글은 욕을 먹으면서도 중상모략을 멈추지 않고 예능을 만들고, 승부욕 불태워주고, 알면서도 모르면서도 당해주는 세븐틴 모두에게 고마울 뿐입니당😇",9,2024-07-04T06:43:53Z,,3

그리고 틀을 벗어나는 행동이 재밌을지 아니면 비난만 받고 끝날지는 어떤 게임이든 끝까지 가봐야 아는 거니까요, 현장에서 미리 거기까지 내다보고 행동하는 건 무리가 아닌가 싶어요..

그런데 대부분의 댓글이 이런 행동들을 비난하고 있는 걸 보니, 제가 온갖 배신과 권모술수와 감정싸움이 난무하는 다른 서바이벌들에 길들여져서 저 정도는 반칙도 아니고 문제로도 안 보여서 많은 분들과 다른 의견을 내고 있는 건가 싶기도 합니다🥲

아무튼 저는 올해도 개성 넘치는 세븐틴 멤버들이 두뇌싸움이나 심리전 크게 한번 해주면 좋겠는데 그러면 또 이렇게 특정 멤버들이 쓴소리 들을 것 같아서 걱정이 되면서도, 보고 싶으면서도, 본인들도 부담이 되려나 그럼 안 나오는 걸까 싶고 그렇네요..

I hope Jeonghan isn't hurt by any of this, but I do hope him and coups tone it down a bit in the future. Jun didn't want to play along and neither did Wonwoo 🥹. Mingyu and Woozi worked so hard too, they really came back from the dead with their pure hard work. They even denied an alliance thinking it would be too unfair. My sweet babies. Anyways, at the end of the day it's all a game and we know that the members are all good people. So let's not take things to heart and let's learn from the constructive criticisms!

i also didn't mind the cheating this time, bc the game got a bit boring after a few rounds..only their reactions were making it fun to watch. also, they already established a court for this kind of thing. let them have the game as they want, it's passable this time bc the staff wasn't even involved one bit.

i don't think the losing team felt defeated that much either, bc it was a supposed game of luck anyways.

LUCK IS HARD TO GAIN!!! 
IF ONLY THERE WASN'T AN ALLIANCE AND ONLY IF NO ONE TOOK A PEEK IN THE FIRST PLACE, I WONDER WHAT'LL HAPPEN?

I am actually scared and nervous while watching them betting and place strategies! I HAVE THESE FEELING THAT THEY'RE CLOSE TO GET ANGRY AND FIGHT JUST TO WIN LOL (but I know Scoups wont :))

I think if all of the team play fair and square, TEAM YEAH might go first place or second and TEAM MUKSABAL will be the champion. 

I felt like Wonwoo and Joshua can make the table turn for real :// Despite Jeonghan saw their cards, they were able to  get their points back. Too bad, Team Muksabal gained the seat. 
TEAM MUKSABAL deserve all the respect here tho.

WE CAN PROBABLY MEASURE THE CRITICAL THINKING AND MIND GAMES OF THE MEMBERS IF THERE WILL NO CHEATING IN MIND GAMES LIKE THESE (It's fine if it's Don't Lie concept XD)

I guess the passion for winning rise to the top here. Jeonghan and Sungcheol is really tough to beat. They don't mind getting their hands dirty. JEONGHEOL isn't JEONGCHEOL without tricks tho XDXD

anyways Jeonghan is freaking hot here. I kept looking and admire his handsomeness. He's so cool.

This should not be a basis for people to criticize the other members. Maybe it's because of the recent courtroom trial episode, people think they can judge and condemn them all they want.

Obviously no team/member deserves any hate comments bc this is just a fun show and not serious at all. However it is fair to make criticisms on this video since it is a variety show and it’s main goal is to be entertaining. Generally, all Gose episodes leave me smiling and content but rarely (like this one) I’m left with just disappointment. It’s truly a shame bc this would’ve been one of my top gose episodes right up until the alliance was seriously considered. Even at the start of the ep when an alliance was proposed, the members themselves had agreed that two teams ganging up on one would make that one team look too pitiful and it won’t be fun. Sad that that’s what it devolved into. I do disagree with anyone defending the alliance and saying it wasn’t cheating or made it more entertaining lol. Even the video speeds up after the alliance and we see less of the suspenseful bets so it def got more predictable and less entertaining. However that’s still just my subjective opinion so there is that. Will always love all members but after episodes like these can’t help but having a little soft spot for the righteous ones 😊",25,2023-11-04T04:15:13Z,,1

RoXZMS_l8SE,UgwqyVRgyxI54qmlkgp4AaABAg,@khaiiii54,UC5NzYhjCOkhk-YBIDHPSjNg,"All those comments saying “It’s just a game,” “Don’t take it too seriously,” what are you so cool about? 😂 That is the whole point! It is just a game, so there’s no point if the players did not enjoy it (do you think the lost team found the cheating so fun in this ep?). Why can’t the cheaters take it less seriously and enjoy it as a game?

More importantly, it is just a SHOW. There is no point if the viewers do not enjoy it. Maybe it is true that morality in us makes us a little bit more uncomfortable about cheating, but actually, many people (including myself) loved the cheating elements and a little ‘injustice’ in earlier episodes of GoSe, b/c it made the show more fun and unpredictable! Now it is becoming stale and, as many comments point out, too predictable. Just not fun. 

Ofc I don’t want anyone to sacrifice important things, like human rights or sth, for my own fun, but what is this ep for.

Plus, apparently not to everyone, but I do think that these kinds of scenes make certain members come off as not very ‘comfortable’ persons to be around. But I don’t judge them b/c this is just a SHOW. But the risk is that these kinds of shows are not 100% fictional like movies, and the line btwn the images that viewers have on the ‘characters’ of the show and on the actual persons, consciously or unconsciously, inevitably becomes blurry. Meaning that it is not good for them either.",6,2023-10-20T11:06:04Z,,1

Hopefully they take this as constructive criticism for future episodes. Cheating is entertaining when even the losing team applauds with winning team on their cheating strategies. That’s the kinda feeling that makes it more fun and lighthearted. Otherwise just comes off as unfair and boring.

I get where you are coming from. however, that's what is called 'being a family'. You will pull pranks on each other, and some people are actually more competitive than others. My siblings are like that too. 

When you get to that level of comfort svt have with each other, then you won't look at it as 'cheating'. It's called working smarter 😊😊. 

Once you look at it like that, you won't leave any GoSe ep unsatisfied.

This is a variety show and cheating/breaking rules is acceptable when it makes the content more fun (like the minghao->dk->wonwoo mafia reveal was one of the best gose moments). However, this ep has an unsatisfying ending no matter how you look at it. I was team HNC and was rooting for them to win and was hoping they’d utilize some ingenious strategy to pull back to the top but then they resorted to this and the match was decided way before the episode ended. It was boring, plain and simple and it’s not wrong to call that put.

I know some people dislike the predictability when cheating/alliances happen (understandably so), but don't forget members can go back on their word. They can gain insight on the opposing team and use it again them (i.e., scoups in the mafia game where he sided with the citizens in the end). Everyone has the right to feel annoyed at the alliance made in this episode, but maybe in the future keep in mind members can betray one another. Hopefully, this will make it still exciting to watch.

He likes it when they showcase their creative abilities. He doesn't like debates because he doesn't understand their wordplay.

cos the guys constantly change their hairstyles and there are many of them my husband could not remembered them all. He knows Mingyu (because of his tall height and slight lisp), Scoups (because he looks like our pall), Hoshi (because of the tiger prints and his behavior under the influence of alcohol), and Jun (because he's my bias).

I also have mixed feelings about this situation. On the one hand, Mingyu’s team had the equal opportunity to create an alliance and decided not to. You need to understand that this is also the part of a game and real life also works like this: in hard situations you need to make alliances and just try to survive. On the other hand, I don’t understand what advantage Wonwoo’s team took from cooperation.

I just hope that even if after negative feedback the rules will become more strict, members will continue to have fun and not feel discouraged or something like this. I’m sure they are playing dirty partly because of simple intention to entertain us, given the good reaction of people to this before. And it’s also true that foul play gives going seventeen some spice and uniqueness. Finding balance is hard, so please don’t be too harsh on them and don’t take it too close to heart.

Do you analyze the game? Every team has the chance to win eventhough the amount of chips are low. They can turnaround if opponent give 'all-in chips'. The highest chips holder can be changed if he lose to opponent with all-in. See how muksabal bounce back from the lowest chips holder to highest in the middle of rounds? See how scoups changed the game by winning all-in before the alliance? See how wonwoo won at last round with only 40 chips eventhough they were all expecting he lose so that HnC and muksabal team will tie? EVERYTHING CAN HAPPEN! 

What scoups and jeonghan did were decreasing muksabal's team winning rate by absorbing Yeah's rate from (33.33 HnC - 33.33 Yeah - 33.33 Muksabal) to (45 HnC - 15 Yeah - 40 Muksabal), it can be different if Jun didnt shaken it. BUT, they are all still can turnaround the game - if Yeah win against Muksabal, or if HnC lose to Muksabal. Even without alliance, HnC can win against muksabal, Yeah can win also, Muksabal also can win. Because eventhough HnC know Yeah's cards BUT they didnt know which card muksabal will choose and they still have few rounds left. It just that the editor's edit makes that muksabal's lose was only because of the alliance.

So I've tried to figure out why is that, and I think I know. In most cases the cheating occurs either way earlier into the episode or is done when one team has a lot more of catching up to do and kind of makes the odds equal.
In this episode on the other hand both team HnC and Muksabal had pretty equal scores and chance to win so there was a lot of tension built up and I was expecting some sort of face-off between them. The moment cheating happened all of this tension disappeared and so did all of the fun I had watching. I think that's where the dissatisfaction I and some people in the coment section feel may be coming from, which makes it honestly a pretty basic broadcasting mistake.",12,2023-09-26T11:34:56Z,,1

I've seen it way too many times that's it's getting annoying. Afterall at the end of the day, it's a variety show and shows are meant to be entertaining. Like if there were no twists in the games and they played according to the book, it'd be boring cause they would just be like curry without salt🌝🤏  Like just chill and enjoy the show?? Why so sensitive about how it'd be better with a 'clean' game😭😭? They're close enough to not mind any of those 'betrayals' and even if there is (that one case with Cheol and Han), that's their business.  They've been together for more than 10 years, they can solve any personal problems between themselves and it isn't even that serious.

Just to point out, I enjoyed it as well others episodes, it was interesting tho.
I love when the members, esp. Scoups and Jeonghan, cheat to make the episode funnier and interesting, but in this episode made me a little uncomfortable (as well the catch stock episode) because forming an alliance was unnecessary. 

About the comments saying that it was supposed to Mingyu's team win: even if there wasn't an alliance, it would be uncertain who would be the winner, because the game is mostly about luck, so everything could happen.

So, Joshua and Wonwoo's team had two options to accept or refuse the alliance: so if they didn't want, they could refuse Scoups and Jeonghan's offer. Hence, they (Wonwoo, Mingyu, The8 and Jun) had doubts to join hands or not and Scoups and Jeonghan seeing Joshua and Wonwoo hesitanting, Scoups said to Jeonghan that they could win without the alliance, but they joint hands. 

The same thing happened in catch stock, when staff offered an alliance with a group (which had the option to refuse) so they accept because they want it as well in the recent episode.

So, like I said before, this alliance was unnecessary, because we already knew who would win and the tense about the game was reduced (at least for me). Although I got a little uncomfortable, it was their choice to accept, so I can't do anything about it. 

It's not about being salty or sensitive about this, but some carats and cubics didn't like it and think like me. It's my opinion.
And just to clarify, I don't hate them in any way, I just didn't like it or didn't think it was that funny like other episodes (esp. those where they cheated)

For me, there are some episodes that it's not my taste and I don't watch it again, but this doesn't mean GoSe isn't for me and I need to stop watching GOSE if I don't like it.

I know how the members are, I know that they cheating can make the game/content more entertaining and funnier, I know that this won't damage their relationship and I know that if they don't like or agree with something, they won't do it anymore.",4,2023-09-27T19:26:58Z,UgyvnIg5Ac_CpYhIv154AaABAg,0

If you feel uncomfortable by watching it, you don't have to watch it again. There are carats like you and that's okay bruh. I certainly have no problem with that, it's just that some comments made me uncomfortable, they seem to have made it way too serious for a game and just in the episodes you mentioned, but others too. And like you said, if they are uncomfortable with these kind of contents, they should not watch. They can first read the comments since there would sure be spoilers for the episodes and if they are okay with it, they can watch. If not, just read the comments or spoil yourself in short videos for bloopers. Watching it could only make them uncomfortable which leads to comments like 'Can they stop cheating for once and play a fair game?' Which I mean all's fair in a game when you want to win (that's at least how I feel) And if the other members okay with it even after knowing, why should we be the first to comment on how it should be?",2,2023-09-27T19:52:22Z,UgyvnIg5Ac_CpYhIv154AaABAg,0

I do think that carats and cubics have the right to give their opinions about the episodes without attacking them, especially Jeonghan, it's not a right thing to do.

About them to see the comments/spoilers before watching the episodes, I disagree. Because there are a lot of people that watch the episodes and give different opinions, so It's better for them to watch the episodes to have their own opinions and thoughts and to have an experience without spoilers about it. It won't be the same, for example: if I see the comments before watching the episodes, my excitement will go away and I won't be able to enjoy, be surprised, laugh, understand the rules of the game and why they did that actions. 

I saw some comments putting the blame on Scoups and Jeonghan, but I don't agree (of course, they cheat a lot, as well other members, and they are so competitive + intelligent and strategists), they should talk about Wonwoo's team too, because they were the ones who agreed on the alliance.

I totally understand and agree that when they (all of them) cheat is funny af and entertain me, but in this episode I felt uncomfortable, because I wanted to see how the game would be without the alliance and feel the climax.

Of course, things aren't like the way we want, but we have to accept. Carats and cubic can give their opinion without attacking them.",2,2023-09-27T21:16:51Z,UgyvnIg5Ac_CpYhIv154AaABAg,0

No, they did not. If you watched their court episode, they all agreed that alliances are fine. They should just not break the rules. In this episode, there was no rule at all. So the alliance is fine.

And tbh, if only JeongCheol's team is in the middle, they could also formed an alliance with Muksabal especially when Jun ignored the alliance. They had thought of forming an alliance with Muksabal's team but they are on the other end. 

And also, if you watched GoSe from the very first start, you'll know alliances have been part of their games. It's nothing new anymore. At this point, we should not be surprised. Ofc, we still want the team who plays fair win of course. Nobody wants to cheer for a team who won because of alliances but don't feel bad for team muksabal so much. This is just a game and a content y'all hahaha! this is not an olympic game or smt LMAO At the end of this content, they'll just laugh these things off while you all being emotional that this or that group did not win.",6,2023-09-25T09:25:55Z,,1

I’m assuming fun to them means for the members which didn’t really translate in the episode. Based on most comments, it wasn’t fun for most viewers either. Just because the rules aren’t explicitly stated doesn’t mean they don’t exist. The Yeah team offered Muk team to be in an alliance when they were losing and they disagreed bc it would be too pitiful for the other team. It became exactly that cause an episode that was well on its way to becoming a very suspenseful entertaining one with an epic ending became stale and predictable and boring. Cheating is fine as long as it’s done ingeniously and adds value, but no one can convince me the alliance made this a more entertaining episode than it could’ve been. I do hope and am sure the members laugh it off in the end but my main concern is that due to continued lack of consequences for cheating and foul play, the members who normally play very fair stop putting effort in the games and trying as hard. I like to see them persevere but it seems like their sincere efforts are never actually paid off and it could be disheartening to them. They could develop or may already have developed a lack of trust in their gose producers for always letting foul play win.",0,2023-11-04T05:32:51Z,Ugx7ee-UTyH1Yw57Sxt4AaABAg,0

Although Jeonghan is my bias  and GoSe is the only show he's comfortable with, i'd rather have him withdraw from this show than see him being hated and called trash by viewers/so-called fans. He's always the one getting most of the hate even when it's a team decision to cheat like in Catch Stock. Even if Scoups was the first one who reached out to Team Yeah for alliance. Even if Team Yeah accepted the deal too that's why the alliance thing happened. Even if he was eliminated twice in the Don't Lie Series and he did nothing, most of the comments were praising Wonwoo for winning the game while insinuating that he can win without cheating unlike Jeonghan. Even if Jeonghan didn't cheat, just rested, cooked and ate in Treasure Island w/ Coups, somehow fans are still annoyed at him because he did nothing while the others persevered in searching for the treasure even if he already shared his opinion on how he thinks the real treasure is them being together but the dongsaengs didn't believe them, of how the 2 hyungs cooked for the members and asked them to eat first before continuing the search. 
If it's the others doing the cheating, they compliment them for being smart and funny.
If it's Jeonghan, it's annoying.
Overall, if Jeonghan does something, it's all his fault.
If he does nothing, fans would still find a way to compliment the members while shading Jeonghan at the same time.
I hope Jeonghan does withdraw from this show and make his own travelling/healing show just like MX Hyungwon (only if Hybe/Pledis allows it).",7,2023-09-24T13:23:57Z,Ugyew0cSHyCunN12yJl4AaABAg,0

또 예능에서는 오히려 캐릭터성이 만들어져서 좋다, 뭐하다. 라고 말하시는 분들도 많은데 오히려 다른 예능 보면 이런 규칙이 정해진 게임에서는 룰 위반, 반칙 등을 제작진이 잘 잡아줌. 런닝맨만 보더라도 배신이나 그런 건 개인전 이름표 뜯기와 같이 동맹이 필수적일 때만 동맹 맺고 배신하고 그러지 팀전 할 때는 동맹, 배신? 꿈도 못 꿈. 그리고 다른 예능은 배신 캐릭터 멤버가 있더라고 해도 배신을 해도 비등비등한 수준임. 런닝맨에서 아무리 다른 멤버가 배신을 하고 꼼수를 써도 압도적인 힘캐, 압도적인 지능캐가 있으니까 배신을 하더라도 쉽게 이길 수 없음. 그래서 뒷상황도 흥미진진하게 보지만 고잉은 다름. 고잉은 배신 하거나 동맹을 맺는 순간 거의 확정적으로 우승자가 되고 그것 때문에 흥미가 떨어짐. 또한 런닝맨 같은 예능에서는 동맹을 맺는 멤버가 한정적이지 않음. A가 동맹 맺을 멤버 찾을 때 언제는 B랑 맺고 또 다른 어느때는 C랑 맺을 때도 있고 또 다른 멤버랑도 맺고 함. 또한 만약 A와 B가 동맹을 맺었다면 C는 D랑 동맹을 맺는 등 해서 다수 vs 다수의 형태가 만들어지기 때문에 비등함. 근데 고잉은 거의 쿱스, 정한, 슈아만 배신하고 동맹 맺을 생각을 함. 실제로 이번에 혼자 남은 묵찌빠 팀에서는 동맹? 상상도 못했고 그 때문에 다수 vs 남은 사람이 되는 거임. 그럼 당연히 다수가 이길 수 밖에 없고 실제로 95즈가 동맹을 맺은 날에는 진 적이 거의 없음. 

말이 길어졌는데 하고 싶은 말은 다른 예능을 언급해가면서 그것들이랑 비교하면 안 된다는거임. 동일한 예능이라도 상황이 전혀 다름.",385,2023-09-22T16:58:28Z,,10

그리고 비록 동맹은 2팀, 즉 8명이서 맺긴 했지만 주도한 사람이 95즈였고 팀원들의 의견이 다 반영됐다고 볼 수는 없음. 물론 영상에 나온 게 다가 아닐테고 영상에 나온 것 외에 다른 팀원들에게 더 의견을 구하는 과정이 있었을지도 모름. 하지만 적어도 준휘는 영상에 나온 것처럼 자기도 모르는 상황에 동맹이 만들어진 것처럼 되었고 이런 상황을 보고 모두가 자의적으로 동맹을 맺었다, 라고 보기는 어려울 듯.",6,2023-09-23T04:46:54Z,Ugxt42ivBJf8xmZ9-qV4AaABAg,0

Everyone have their own charisma but disgracing one member because he used different method is so wrong

The highlight moments right after that was when Wen Junhui went for Mingyu, when Dino wanted to win against Team Muksabal and when Wonwoo went for Hoshi, which means when they went against the pre-planned thing. I was hoping for Wonwoo to purposely lose to turn the game into a tie, that would be more interesting.

Coups and Jeonghan are smart and clever and they do whatever it takes to grab the win but I'm surprised to see how other members easily join their plans even when there's no benefit for them in the end. 

Sucks for Team Muksabal, even if they go to the court for this, that won't change this ep, this game was so enjoyable before the whole alliance thing ruined it in the end.

RoXZMS_l8SE,UgzPOn-2eW2gvdSr_Jx4AaABAg,@j.ustjump,UCvuC7oPMZ20-CHbH6SfmbHg,"I really enjoyed these episodes! I took me a while to get the rules but once I did, the game kept me on the edge of my seat 😂 now, though this is a game, it is unfortunate that discussions about the guys characters and morals are included when playing games. 

Now, I was rooting for Mingyu’s team (well lowkey, any team that has Mingyu and or Vernon but still). A lot of people in the comments had some very good points discussing both sides to this, but I do see people  with slightly bothered feelings about these eps. Yes Jh is known for being a mastermind (or one who cheats often) and Mingyu is known for being the genius that he is who for the most part plays according to the game. It’s all in good fun. Now, forming alliances can be seen as cheating or not but it depends on the INTENT. 

It’s like avengers at the end of the day - Iron man’s team and Cap.’s we’re disagreeing but they came together to fight the obviously bad/evil side - the intent of the alliance was to defeat Thanos — TWO GOOD teams. In this instance, with the guys, there is no bad team - all are good teams, but the intent of the “alliance” was to form together so that ONE team would win, not both (becuz one had the advantage I believe) knowing they PROBABLY couldn’t win on their own. That’s the difference. Is it bad? Hell no. But to them, their bargain was, if u let us win, we’ll share the prize. Cool. The point is, becuz it’s based on chance (and with some strategic thinking) any team could have won standing alone. Now, these games are NOT a reflection of their overall character as a person. 

Now we see comparisons in the comments - some funny and some obviously emotional. Yes every team, or member have cheated at some point, no one’s denying, but the fact that they had COURT - the slate should have been clean. Meaning, moving forward, they follow rules, play fairly, etc. so that means any cheating in the past, should have been erased after that court ep. Yeah, no one cheated in terms of physically stealing chips and stuff, of course. Again, this is all in good fun. 

But taking the biasness out of it, and this is just what it is, Jh and coups, esp. coups was looking annoyed and stressed - and of course it’s a game. Hell, when playing games I get playfully stressed too, but it was clearly evident on their faces, so of course, but any means let’s win. Now it also really nicked them becuz it was against Mingyu - ALL in good fun again. When Mingyu’s team started winning, that’s when shit gets real — everyone knows each others strengths and weaknesses, when it comes to games, it ain’t new. 

And I think people forget in the very beginning of Part 1 of this series, before they started, Jeonghan peeked at Mingyu’s team cards! 😂 so they had the upper hand to begin with. But again, I thought it was funny.

Let’s be honest, Mingyu is always everyone’s target, whether it’s playing games in these eps. Or just to pick on him. It’s the truth, but again it’s not malicious tho. But beating someone like Mingyu who has it all, u get prideful. When they are ON his team, it’s no longer a threat. 

Of course I don’t agree with people villainizing jeonghan becuz he is sweet, and I also don’t agree with people throwing daggers at Mingyu’s character some MORE because we’re used to him being picked on and people thing he needs to be knocked off his high horse knowing he’s one of the humblest people ever, even though he’s ideal. 

I also did have a soft spot for Jun as well 😌 but again, we all know damn well the 3 oldest members already have an alliance with each other, regardless of the GoSe ep. Like hello? 95-line forever - that’s a given. Lol 

I also seen people bring up Mingyu putting the camera up during that other ep. but again, EVERYONE was cheating. When they came up the 30 sec to 1 min rule after u get caught u stay in the room? No one listened? They even locked his door, y’all remember that? Locking doors, having doors open like??? Lol 

Again, overall this was intense yet fun, but real talk, some members did get bothered cuz it was a stressful game. Let’s be honest here. 

I for one, never cheat in games. It’s nothing wrong with it (to a degree) but I just don’t lol. U acquire skill when u do sht right, that’s just me. So at the end of the day — some people need others to help get to the goal, and some can just stand and be righteous on their own. That’s truth.",4,2023-09-21T20:53:44Z,,1

2.) what value is that? 
3.) if my bias wins while doing the same thing that the opposite team did, will i be annoyed?

Let's give credit as well to the people behind Going Seventeen, the creative staff for creating content for Seventeen. Of course Seventeen gives their input as well and they even have episodes where Seventeen members are brain storming for what kind of content they would like to do. I swear S.Coups and Jeonghan are two bright members but sneaky as well. The alliance form was an intelligent move and I can't wait for the reaction of Woozi, Mingyu, Hoshi and Vernon when they know that an alliance happened on this episode. Kudos to Jeonghan, S.Coups, DK and Dino for winning the game and of course thanks to the support of team Wonwoo, Joshua, The8 and Jun. I'm going to miss Going Seventeen since they'll be on break, but I'm sure Seungkwan will now appear on the next episode (hoping and praying).

Therefore, when the alliance happened, that established outcome of Muksabal's victory was now changed, and that is the effect of being unpredictable I was talking about.

For hnc team, you all cannot call it as ""cheating"" as there are no explicit rules that alliances are NOT allowed. Of course, the going svt team had all of these predicted the moment they created this game without the rules. The members already agreed that alliances are allowed. You cannot invalidate someone's intelligence and strategies just because you consider it as ""cheating"", which was by definition, are against the rules. However, in this game, there was no explicit rule that said ""no alliances"" must be formed. 
Kudos to Jeonghan and Seungcheol, they know what they want and they'll definitely get it. Jeonghan, Dk, Dino, and Scoups' strategies were also commendable! 

For Team Yeah, I was hoping for Joshua to pull it off ngl. This team's main goal that day was only to have fun. The only thing I could say about this team is you guys did great! Jun and Wonwoo still played with whomever they want to. I liked that they stood with what they want. And Minghao, you words of wisdom and facts are so amazing.


For muksabal team, Woozi definitely made actual analyses and strategies, alongside Mingyu. I want to see more of this side of Woozi. Vernon's ideas were really helpful also, and Hoshi's confidence was commendable. 


Guys, the members already acknowledged that chances of winning is high if two teams would have team up to win. There were no specific rules for alliances. Technically, you cannot call it ""cheating"" as it did not violate their rules. 

Had to say these because y'all are going with each other's asses here and on twitter.",5,2023-09-21T13:09:36Z,,0

Joshua is named the King Maker and it's totally a tease. The facial expression he showed at last in the cookie clip is filled with awkwardness and embarrassment when he got the winning card from Scoups(still figuring it's the golden or silver one), and being the only one in Team Yeah who got a share from the pie.

In my opinion, Shua is the most miserable one in this episode. He was put in a very difficult situation. He might be one of the evil twins and a 95 liner, but he also got the nature of being a gentleman. When he wants to play fair and makes his own effort, he surely can. This time he got to team up with the ""good students"", Wonwoo, Jun, The8, these are the ones who tend to be more obedient to the rules and can win beautiful games without using any tricks. It was a perfect team for Shua to shine and I was thinking maybe he could show a different side of him cuz he got escaped from the 95z, but I was wrong, he failed.

Shua did not want to let his 95z friends down by not accepting their deal which is clearly an unfair offer, on the other side, he also cared about his Team Yeah members. He showed hesitation when he first received the offer and being the only one who got asked cuz he had the most chips in his hands, but he knew that's not how an alliance agreement is formed. The decision should be made as a team by consulting all the opinions from the teammates. The reactions of the other 3 Team Yeah members showed their hesitation and frustration, the remaining performance of these 3(WW, Jun, The8) can prove it. It's like they got shut down. We can also tell from the unexpected move of Jun and WW in the gameplay, they were figting the unfair alliance by using their own power , they got my respect from that.

Joshua was the key of turning point of this gameplay, he was also the key of his team by holding the most chips even when the team seemed to be losing, but it's a game of luck and fate. Shua failed to stand still with his values and failed to keep the chance for his teammates to voice up their thoughts and decisions, despite being the only 95z in his own team. Joshua is no King Maker, his fate seems to be settled at the very beginning of the GOSE history, he is just a poor little jester in the 95 line. 

Will Shua ever get the chance to break the chain and create his own fate for once in the GOSE kingdom?

RoXZMS_l8SE,Ugyg-gM2vt9yaviIqUp4AaABAg,@Strawgirl123,UCIuSO-HTq27VFnOVw1215RQ,"Let’s dialogue like adults.

These are men in their mid to late twenties. They shouldn’t be infantilized or put on a pedestal out of reach of fair critique.

They are in this show, not just out of the goodness of their hearts or passion, but also because this is part of their actual jobs, and for reach and monetization that viewers provide.

So viewers’ individual opinions do matter. A lot of comments here are clearly critiquing decisions and outcomes that affected their personal enjoyment (which is exactly the source of the show’s reach and monetization), not the actual members and their moral characters.

This is a show. The members have their roles to fulfill to make an episode enjoyable, which is probably an amalgamation of their real selves, public personas, and their assigned or self-assigned GoSe roles. Since this show is made to entertain us, it’s fair for us to provide feedback on whether it succeeds per episode or not.

We WANT to be entertained. We love these guys. We are just saying how this show can be better.

This game was poorly managed. I admit that for the first time, I lost interest to watch a GoSe episode til the end when Jeonghan saw Team Yeah’s cards and used that information to win. All teams were just getting used to the rules of the game, so an unequal playing field at that point pretty much meant their team more or less had the win in the bag. We know the boys take responsibility for being content creators seriously, but in my opinion S. Coups clearly lost his cool and prioritized winning over making generally enjoyable content, not to make Part 2 fun, but because he hates to lose.

Set this against the backdrop of the underdog team (that human nature is primed to like and relate to) who actually clawed their way back from hell and was on the brink of winning being denied by repeat offenders exploiting loopholes.

Given these, I think it is understandable why a lot of people felt the injustice more than the feeling that everything was being done for the sake of fun.

The weakness of GoSe PD and staff when it comes to these kinds of episodes is that, unlike other K-variety shows, they almost never police the members to course correct, even when it means the episode is going south.

I know we should criticize constructively by suggesting possible solutions, so here’s mine:

It would benefit the GoSe PDs, writers, and staff to consider human psychology for the audience’s sake when mapping out the rough edges and rules of an episode. Why was Treasure Island so unfulfilling for the viewer? Because embarking a journey comes with the expectation of a destination/reward. If there is none and the moral of the story is that the journey IS the destination, the experience better be poignant or supremely enjoyable. It was neither.

For this episode, I guess it is a combination of a significant number of viewers getting irritated with predictable outcomes when a normal ending by itself was fun enough and that humans are primed to root for the underdog, and here the underdog managed to get so close to victory by sheer hard work and wits, but all for naught.

I think there can be a compromise between retaining the GoSe show’s unique character while knowing when to step on the breaks now and then, when to stir things up, and when to innovate and go a whole new direction.

Of course, I’m still cheering for you, Seventeen and GoSe Team! I know you can do better next time! Rest well and see you on the next comeback!",45,2023-09-21T05:50:02Z,,11

Before the JJY scandal happened I was a big fan of 2 days 1 night and the cast cheat ALL the time lmao but what makes it different from GoSe is the penalties is also very heavy. And that's exactly how you make cheating fun, by placing in real consequences so watching the cast trying all sort of tricks to avoid getting caught was funny in itself. Unfortunately I don't know why the same can't be done on GoSe. Is it because the PDs are technically hired by Seventeen instead of the other way around so maybe they don't want to overstep their boundaries? But if that's the case then I wish the members have some awareness and can police themselves better when filming. They've done this for years and Scoups also says he monitors what the fans say, so I hope moving forward Scoups and Jeonghan can learn when to pull the cheating card for the sake of making the show exciting instead of simply to win a silly game.",6,2023-09-21T07:31:37Z,Ugyg-gM2vt9yaviIqUp4AaABAg,0

Some comments say that if the alliance hadn't been formed, Muksabal would've made the episode boring by folding each time, but for me, knowing the two teams aligned made the episode even more boring because there was zero tension at the actual card table whenever the two allied teams played. Jun and Wonu saved this episode in my opinion, because they acted counter to the allied teams' expectations.",12,2023-09-21T23:51:35Z,Ugyg-gM2vt9yaviIqUp4AaABAg,0

JH-SC: really competitive, can think outside the rules and exploit the holes in the rules to get the win they want, usually leads a (-) team

MG-Woozi-WW: competitive but not as much as above, can win by maximizing just what the rules entails with just their mind and intuition, usually leads a (+) team 

Josh-Hoshi: gets competitive as a reaction to other's competitiveness, a mix of the two above, thinking outside the box and their intuition are key in their wins, once they were given a better circumstance of winning, they'll take that in a heartbeat. great members if you wanna annoy competitors.

Jun-Myungho: sticks with the rules and maximizes it to their own plan, best fitted member of a team with (+) leaders but can also work well with (-) team.

Dino-DK: sticks greatly to the rules but can be coached to cheat, sometimes they can pull it off, fits any team, honestly these two are generally the type to bring the funny incidents in the game without thinking about the team (ex: they'll ""fight"" their own team member and it will be so funny). great members if you wanna annoy competitors.

Vernon: a lowkey ver of the combination of the two above (Jun-MH and Dino-DK)

as for SK: competitive but gets more competitive as a reaction to other, honestly, SK generally brings the ""human"" side to these games. ex: ""Will they be mad?"" but still sticks to the evil plan.

This is one of those Brain GoSe that the ""cheating"" done (you say cheating, i say this is strategy) is just calculated and well executed, that I can't even hate lol. 

Tho I can see how it may be annoying since the ones who always win using this type of strategy is just JH-SC duo and sometimes Joshua. Other tries (and you know that they can execute well outside GoSe: ShiBro on Bro Marbles, Myungho etc.) but it just that the competiveness-filled mind of JH-SC (and also the difference in each member's nature) just makes this 2 execute their plans well.

or maybe, the reason why I'm so accepting was because I've been so into these types of contents (Liar Game, NGNL, Kakegurui, Busted (netflix), The Genius etc.) where everyone just find creative ways (albeit may be deemed unfair by others who didnt think of that way) to win a game you might think be impossible/just a game of luck.",1,2023-09-21T02:21:48Z,,0

However, the cheating is becoming predictably uninteresting because you know everytime Coups or Jeonghan are backed into a corner, they'll resort to it which negates the whole game to begin with. They began by cheating and ended it with cheating which at this point none of us are surprised by. Predictable. 

What is annoying is the people arguing that ""it's just a game, chill"" and people should ""get over it"". Just because you either:  

A. Lack the ability to employ critical thinking skills and are incapable of considering nuance when it comes to the way millions of seventeen fans (both cubics and carats) are going to digest content...

OR 

B. You are completely blinded by your emotional parasocial attachment to the members, you fail to muster even an ounce of objectivity to both the content and the different reactions it'll elicit FROM A GLOBAL AUDIENCE... 
doesn't mean you need to gaslight everyone else into thinking and feeling the way you do about it. 

It's a variety show created to evoke a reaction, emotional or otherwise and you don't get to police the reactions of other people.

Nobody thinks the guys are weeping in their bed tonight because they lost a game of rock paper scissors, they're simply stating that GoSe loses its thrill when the only ""twist"" the guys can come up lately is by blatantly cheating, again. Once it becomes repetitive and predictable, viewers are gonna stop being invested because what's the point when there's only one outcome? And the most frustrating thing is the game was excellently planned (credits to the writers👏) so it's waste to see it ended like this.

Sometimes cheating makes the shows interesting and exciting, but sometimes it can backfire too. For example, cheating can make a game like 'Don't Lie' or any sports game more fun. However, in mind games, cheating can undermine the essence of the game and even though it may make the show interesting in some cases. Take 'Catch Stock' for instance. Cheating made the show more exciting and interesting because initially everyone predicted that Mingyu team would win due to having more stock. However, the cheating made the outcome unpredictable and the twist ending made the show thrilling. Therefore, in my opinion, the cheating was acceptable.

But in this kind of game, it would be more interesting without cheating, in my opinion. The winner would be unpredictable, and the viewers would be more excited to see how the tables would turn and which team would be the winner in the end.

솔직히 이 편만 보면 예능인데 막판가서 동맹할 수도 있지 싶을 수 있는데 사람들 반응이 좋지 않고 저 또한 마음이 불편한건 그전부터 꾸준히 마음에 걸리던 것들이 쌓여서인 것 같네요ㅠ 편법이 계속 용인되고(캐치스탁, 하이드앤싴) 본래 기획의도라고 생각했던 것들이 무너지고(보물섬) 하면서 다른 멤버들이 열심히 참여한 그 몰입이 수포로 돌아가는 걸 여러번 봤으니까요ㅠ 근데 막 재미라도 있어서 웃고 넘어갈 수 있는 편법이 아니라 재미 1도 없는 것들이라서 더..

개인적으로 제가 정한님의 사기나 편법 스타일이나 성향이 저와 맞지 않아서 그런 모습이 나왔을 때 재미를 못느끼는 것일 수도 있는데 (돈라이때 룰에 없는 직업으로 사기치는 거, 권순영찾기에서 목적지를 알았음에도 일부러 안가고 틀어버린 거, 예전 윷놀이 브이앱 때 팀 지려고 하니까 쿱스한테 영어시킨거 등), 이번 편 같은 경우도 제작진이 룰에 반칙 언급을 안하고 제지하지 않은 탓도 있겠지만 제작진 입장에서 참여자들의 자유도를 어떻게 일일이 촉각 곤두세워가면서 제지하나요.. 그냥 좀 멤버들 차원에서 과도하거나 기획의도에 맞지 않는 편법은 지양해줬으면 좋겠어요. 팀내에서 정한이가 형이고 영향력이 있으니까 그런거 있을때마다 멤버들도 별 지적 없이 수용하거나 넘어가는 것 같긴 한데.. 그런 거 안해도 사람이 많기 때문에 충분히 다양한 그림 많이 나오고 케미쩔고 웃기고 재밌단 말이에유ㅠㅠ

세븐틴이 좋고 고잉이 좋으니까 오래 재밌는 컨텐츠로 사랑받길 바라서 쓰는 댓글이니 비난보다는 비판으로 봐주시면 좋겠네요ㅠ 아마 댓글 쓰신 다른 캐럿분들도 그런 마음이지 않을까요?

I need to remind myself to not read the comments whenever Jeonghan does something. Jeonghan ain’t my bias (I’m OT13, I change bias every second haha), but ya’ll are so nasty when it comes to this man. Stop breathing down on the member's necks. They are grown men, they know what they are doing. They don't need anyone to tell them what to or not to do each time. My point is a lot of people are already criticizing some of the members left and right (outside of Caratland), and now even Carats are doing it. Seriously, just for rock, paper, scissors? We all have to do some self-reflection for a month (without gose starting next week). We need to stop (or slow down a little bit) of being critical of the members. This is the only show where they can be like their ‘true’ / chaotic self (I’d like to think that this is their true self, not the cheating or tricking the members, I mean they are the most comfortable in this show, so please don’t come after me).

tbh as a Jeonghan fan, I want him to play one clean game and beat Mingyu so that people will shut up about it. or even if he doesn't win, that's fine, as long as the game is clean. am I a bit disappointed that he cheated again? yeah. but I am more disappointed because I know people will start attacking him for it. and people can word their thoughts more nicely, I think. tbh in cases like these, the GOSE directors should be more strict

I don't mind criticism because opinions matter, but the hate that they throw on Jeonghan is unfathomable, especially when it wasn't him alone cheating in this episode. it was the whole 95 line.

my biases are jeonghan AND jun so to see these stupid akgaes pitting them against each other in the comment section is truly heartbreaking. since you all clearly do not watch gose regularly, you all won't remember that in Don't Lie: CLUE #1, jun was asking jeonghan to include him in whatever alliance jeonghan was forming. jeonghan refused, staying true to his alliance.

in One Million Won, the members were practically begging jeonghan to cheat ""to make the show more fun."" at this time, jeonghan was already vocalizing how some commenters thought of him as ""trash"".

maybe you all will only appreciate jeonghan's out-of-the-box tactics once he enlists. he doesn't deserve these ""carats"" who so callously comment against him for just trying to make the show more fun.",6,2023-09-20T22:55:24Z,,1

And bending the rules in a variety show is fun for the audience, but when it only gives an advantage and not an outright certainty of winning everything.

I’ve always understood why Jeonghan and his various GoSe teams spiced things up before, but I think he’s doing it way too often in general and too much in this particular episode.

Even though there was an undertable deal between HnC and Yeah teams, I don't see it's worth bringing them to the court to judge.

Other team, like Muksalbang in previous ep had the intention to team up with Yeah to beat HnC, but that team up was not successfully formed.

So, him choosing hoshi, as what minghao and dk said, was to make the game fun. He made jeonghan's team a lil nervous with how he will play the game. Tho he has to stick to what was agreed because he's nice. 

And if you can see, he should've gone with scoups to solidify their win, that's what made the hnc team nervous, and shua had to tell and remind wonwoo to play rock against hoshi cuz if he decided to play paper, then the scores will be tied, breaking the alliance.",61,2023-09-21T00:48:10Z,UgxWyxItCZgLZ1T2Y054AaABAg,0

RoXZMS_l8SE,UgwAJFyo-vHbE9FCbdx4AaABAg,@dotdotdot...176,UCNw6fTkYpU4EnLQaqwofVHw,"Tbh I'm a little tired of all the comments fighting about who is the ""brain"" in each team when all the members are smart and it was a game of luck. I'm also a bit over the dozens of comments about ""if the other teams didn't form an alliance then Mingyu will win"". Idk if that claim is 100% for sure since it was a game of chance and Seventeen is always unpredictable in some way - perhaps Mingyu's team still might not have won even without the other teams' alliance, if you consider certain members' unpredictability (Teams Yeah/HnC could have betrayed each other at any time or any of the members could make an unpredictable move or chose the wrong card at any time) plus the Joker cards add a lot of unpredictability, and HnC had the most chips at that point anyway. It seems like the chances were still there for HnC to win without alliance, even if it was a small chance. Perhaps - I'm not fully sure but I think there was still a chance - if someone has a maths degree or something they can reply below to explain more about the probability. If it turns out that Mingyu's team truly would have won (with no doubt) and there was really _zero chance_ of the other teams winning without their alliance, then I guess we will just see HnC and Yeah teams in court some time soon. But I'm not sure if alliances were directly against the game rules either, I guess we will find out. Also, everyone who watches GoSe regularly already knows that Mingyu is smart. Mingyu, Jeonghan, S.Coups, Wonwoo and Woozi are all geniuses in GoSe brain games pretty much every time they play one - so there is not much reason for some commenters to say this, we all know it and no one was really denying it. They could all win a mind game fair and square if they wanted to, they are all smart enough. (Seventeen members in general are very smart and their unpredictability really increases the thrill of mind game episodes, but those members in particular enjoy cerebral challenges/mind games and are good at using their brains, aka brain storming 😂). Also, alliances, rule breaking, unpredictability, cheating and plot twists ALWAYS happen in GoSe episodes and the members sometimes do these things on purpose just for the reason of creating a more interesting/entertaining/engaging episode - in general, a plot twist is more interesting than no twist, especially in GoSe games where Seventeen betrays alliances just as easily as they form them. They know this very wel themselves, so there is no reason to be genuinely worked up about it.

Anyway this comment was not really meant to be about that - I mean, there are already so many comments about it that we can basically conclude that we will (probably) see them in ""court"", so I won't go on any more about it myself - I'm not saying it was a fair game and I'm not trying to fight, I'm just saying there is nothing more/new for me to say about this that hasn't already been said - my main point was that, whether an alliance was cheating or not, that there is no _real_ reason for carats/cubics to get genuinely worked up about it; it's a game on an edited variety show, not life and death. And we don't only have to focus on that, there are a lot of other parts of the episode to comment on too. 

So rather than saying more of the same thing as like 100 other existing comments, I want to talk more about the concept of the episode itself. I haven't personally seen any comments about that yet (maybe there are some but I just haven't seen them when I scrolled this comment section). I just want to say... I love all the members' outfits! And their ""character"" concepts behind each outfit. They are all so unique and different, but they somehow work together for this game concept 🤔 

Dino looks like a high school kid who plays poker in a random basement he came across by accident, during his spare time after school instead of doing homework 😂 Minghao kinda looks like a gangster in an old Korean movie, like this is his basement/garage, and DK is dressed like a character in a 90s Hollywood film. Meanwhile Jeonghan in his tracksuit with one leg rolled up looks like a guy who just stays home all the time and only comes out to play games/gamble, but Wonwoo in his tracksuit looks like his usual gameboi self. Jun and Mingyu also kinda look like members of Minghao's gang, especially with those shirts and sunglasses 😂 then there is Woozi looking like a gentleman from 1880s-1940s 💀 as if he is here to play games after drinking whiskey at a pub, and Hoshi has a neat preppy outfit but a contrasting cocky attitude. I love all these characters/outfits for this basement gambling concept setting! It makes the game even more interesting especially visually; it looks like a bunch of very different people of different ages who all just happened to meet through their shared hobby of gambling lol, and now they are playing a competition among themselves. Also this game itself is quite interesting, I personally have never heard of it before so props to whoever came up with the idea. Once again the GoSe team outdid themselves in creating a new and entertaining episode concept for us carats (or cubics)! One of the edits even said ""all of them were given a backstory"" which is so cool! The attention to detail in the GoSe team and Seventeen is really amazing. For example, Jun with his lollipop and Dino with his ""lucky"" backpack. 😂 Thank you for another great episode! And I guess this episode also guarantees even more future content, in the form of a court episode. 😂

PS: the comeback (11th mini album ""Seventeenth Heaven"") will come out soon in October, make sure to check it out if you can. I'm so excited!

PPS: on a more serious note, I hope all Seventeen members can be/stay healthy and safe, especially leading up to this comeback. Their wellbeing should be their top priority and after the year we've had, I just want them all to be safe, uninjured and generally well. Obviously no one can be happy 100% of the time, but I hope they can be as happy (and healthy) as physically possible. I also hope Coups' current surgery recovery period goes well.

저는 'Yeah팀'과 '묵사발팀'을 주로 응원하는 걸 발견했어요. Yeah 팀에는 원우가 있었고 저는 이 남자 머리에 편견이 있었어요 ㅋㅋㅋ 그리고 다른 팀에는 엄청 미친 듀오인 민규와 호시가 있었거든요. 나는 팀 역학을 좋아했습니다.
솔직히 저도 HnC팀을 응원하고 있어요. DK와 디노가 있어서 이 팀의 다이나믹도 마음에 들지만 정한과 쿱스가 둘 다 있어서 svt 멤버들 특히 부처럼 같이 있으면 불평을 많이 해요. 😂 게임할 때 같이 있지 않아도 될까요? 😂 그게 제가 가진 유일한 불만이에요 😅😂 둘이 짝을 이루지 않았다면 상황이 달라졌을 거라고 확신해요. 서로 배신하지 않는다면 그들은 너무 강하다 😅😂.
어쨌든, 이 에피소드는 나에게 약간 씁쓸하지만 이것이 다시 이 작품을 GoSe로 만드는 이유입니다! 😅💜
그러니까 정한이를 미워하지 말아주세요. 이것은 게임이자 버라이어티 쇼입니다. 그들은 사람들을 즐겁게 하기 위해 성격에 맞지 않는 일을 합니다. 예를 들어 고세에서 정한은 나쁜/사기꾼 이미지, DK는 멍청/멍청한 이미지를 갖고 있다고 멤버들이 말한 것처럼요. 그들은 우리를 위해 재미있는 일을 만들고 싶어하며 그들이하는 모든 일은 삶의 실제 가치를 반영하지 않습니다. 우리는 때때로 씁쓸해질 수도 있고 괜찮습니다. 왜냐하면 우리가 특정 멤버들에게 편견을 가질 수 있다는 뜻입니다 🤷🏻‍♀️ 하지만 이만 지나가도록 해주세요, 사랑과 평화 ✌️",4,2023-09-20T16:02:21Z,,0

I found myself rooting for ""Yeah team"" and ""Muksabal Team"" more mainly cuz Yeah team had Wonwoo and I'm biased about this man's head lol and cuz other team had a super crazy duo, Mingyu and Hoshi. I just loved the team dynamics. 
Honestly i found myself rooting for team HnC too cuz Dk and Dino was there i mean I loved this team's dynamics too but they had both Jeonghan and Coups so just like the svt members especially Boo, I complain a lot when they are together. 😂  Like can y'all please not be together when playing games? 😂 That's the only complain i have 😅😂  Like if they weren't paired up together I'm pretty sure things might have turned out different. They are just too strong together if they don't betray each other that is😅😂.
Anyways, this ep is a bit bittersweet for me but then again this is what makes it GoSe! 😅💜 
That being said, don't hate Jeonghan please. This is a game and a variety show. They do things out of character to entertain people. Like the members themselves have told how Jeonghan has a bad/cheater image and Dk a stupid/dumb image in GoSe for example. They wanna make things entertaining for us guys and everything they do doesn't reflect their actual values in life. We might get bitter sometimes and that's okay cuz i mean we could be biased towards certain memebers 🤷🏻‍♀️ but let it pass and please, Love and peace ✌️",8,2023-09-20T15:53:53Z,,0

RoXZMS_l8SE,UgzZ6DwrK58NOr8WXwB4AaABAg,@fiveh3340,UCvJlRpVfzxB5XxbqgKlRg-A,"here's why im disappointed with this episode: 

1. It's because I KNOW team HnC could win even without cheating. They CAN. They even might have won anyway. They WERE winning, up until the last of the 4th round. and that's what hurts me. because now, instead of getting to say ""Ha! They did it without cheating!"" to shut the haters up, we have to wait for another time for them to do so. I think at this point I believe in Han and Cheol's intelligence more than they believe in themselves. Cheol was correctly guessing their cards and Han was getting lucky with most of his plays. They're not as bad as they think

2. I know that people will blow this out of proportion. People are already starting to put all the blame on JH when it wasnt his decision alone to cheat. It wasn't his team that accepted the deal

3. Despite people saying it was a clear win for Muksabal, tbh even in my head I could come up with scenarios in which HnC could win WITHOUT forming alliances. In fact, they were ready to do that anyway if Team Yeah didnt accept. It was always gonna be Muksabal vs HnC. It was always gonna be one of the two. It's not as clear cut as people make it seem. ""If they didn't form an alliance, Muksabal would have won"" No. There's no way to know with this game. Muksabal would've played it safe and HnC would've went all in. They still could've won. Hell, even Team Yeah could (though at a smaller chance)

4. People overrate the ""brain line"". Theyre human too. Mingyu makes mistakes, so do Jeonghan, Wonwoo, Seungcheol, etc. Fir example, Jeongcheol's decision to ask Dino to play rock in that one round was one of the turning points for Muksabal's win, when they could've won if they went with Dino's plan. When people rely so much on the ""brain line"" label, people dont see the utter genius of others like Woozi who was silently scheming on his own, etc. It also creates pressure for the ones who are labeled smart, and hence drives them to be even more competitive. Let's not label them, because they'll be tied to these labels. Instead let's enjoy and celebrate the individual genius actions they take

come on, GOSE PDs. just interfere and make one clean game so it'll shut everyone up, no matter who wins",5,2023-09-20T14:51:26Z,,0

Because of that, Muksabal could still not have won anyway even if the other teams didn't team up. Because HnC had most chips, and Hoshi and Mingyu were acting more cocky and thus maybe more chance to lose from overconfidence? As the saying goes, pride comes before a fall. I think the members' unpredictability, the teams chosen to play and the Joker cards also play a role in an unexpected outcome, so maybe Muksabal still might not have won if they played a wrong card? Maybe I'm wrong but perhaps even if HnC and Yeah Team didn't teamed up, there was still a chance Muksabal team could have chosen a wrong card and not won anyway? I'm not saying it was fair or that cheating didn't give the other teams an advantage, I'm just saying I'm not so sure that Muksabal team 100% would have won if not for the cheating. I'm not great with probability so anyone with a math degree or something can correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought there was still a small chance of HnC winning anyway even without cheating. Edit: just a disclaimer,  I'm not saying Mingyu's team ""deserved"" to lose or something just because they were being a bit cocky - that was probably also just part of the character/episode concept - I'm just saying that it probably made it easier for the other teams to form an alliance against them than if they weren't pretending to be cocky. I'm not saying it's Mingyu's team's fault - just saying that Seventeen almost always forms alliances in games anyway, usually teaming up on the member/team with the biggest advantage or most confidence to win. Mingyu has teamed up with Jeonghan and S.Coups himself in the past. So it's not because the members/people think Mingyu's team couldn't win fair and square, it's precisely because they _could_ win and were confident about it that the other teams were more open to making an alliance/potentially breaking rules.

Anyway, I don't think we need to get too worked up (sad or angry) about it though, itwas just a game and alliances happen in GoSe all the time - every member of Seventeen has formed alliances at some point in GoSe episodes. Alliances and even rule-breaking happens all the time in GoSe, and the members know this better than anyone. They may play up their reactions in court for entertainment, but I don't think any of them are seriously very angry/sad about it. And if the alliance really was a _huge_ breaking of rules, then they will show up in court. It's simple as that. Also, just because cheating sometimes happens in GoSe episodes/games like this, it doesn't mean that the members aren't still smart - literally no one is denying that Mingyu is very clever in brain games, as well as Jeonghan, S.Coups, Wonwoo and Woozi. Idk why some people feel the need to comment ""Mingyu is smart"". We all know this. He and the other members I mentioned _always_ do well in mind games like this, and they are also among the most competitive. Just because cheating happens, it doesn't mean that Mingyu or any of the members for that matter can't win mind games fair and square. It's just that alliances, rule-breaking, cheating and unpredictable stuff is common in GoSe - which is fine, because it's meant to be fun and entertaining not serious or something to get actually sad about. People even expect alliances, rule breaking, cheating and plot twists because of this, otherwise Seventeen wouldn't continue to do it. Just because it wasn't necesssrily fair doesn't mean we have to be genuinely sad/angry. Like I said, they know cheating happens, no one is genuinely surprised about that part. And like I said, if it was a big breach of this game's rules then we will see them again in ""court"" soon enough.",44,2023-09-20T15:30:56Z,UgwYuyOhmtkT6uzeTyZ4AaABAg,0

Wonwoo winning against hoshi was also up to luck, if he had lost then mingyu and scoups would have had to actually play rock scissors papers to determine the winners.

I dont personal see teaming up as some evil cheating plan i believe everything the members do in gose is to maximise the entertainment of the show even in the court ep they agreed cheating can be allowed sometimes if it makes it more fun cos all the members know each other then they all know that their intentions to cheat arent malicious plus they got punishments for cheating too so i dont think its that deep. Jeonghan is genuinely one of the most kind and sweet idols ive ever seen and all the members have said this so kindly stfu about his character.

고잉팀이 만드는 게임은 협력을 하는 즉시 협력하지 않는 팀이 지도록 설계되는 경우가 많은데 정공법으로 돌파하는 팀이 지는 그림은 한 두번이면 족하지 않나요. 배신과 뒤통수 친 쪽이 이기는 그림에 짜릿함도 뭣도 없어요. 게임을 재밌게 잘 즐긴 애들 쪽에 내가 다 미안해집니다. 캐치스탁 때랑 비슷한 느낌인데 이런 그림을 재밌다고 생각해서 협력 금지 조항을 만들지 않은 거라면 더 할 말도 없어요.

게다가 가위바위보 무적 카드라는 밸런스 붕괴 아이템을 상품으로 거는 건 어디에서 나온 아이디어인가요. 차라리 상금이었으면 이리 허탈하지도 않았을텐데 점점 뭐하자는 생각이 듭니다. 파워인플레가 서비스 종료 직전까지 간 망한 카드게임 보는 느낌이에요. 

게다가 자컨의 이유가 뭡니까. 공백기간 채우려고 있는 거 아니에요? 미방영 된 장면이라도 편집해서 올리려는 노력도 안하나요. 쉬어갈 거면 차라리 애들 활동 기간에 쉬는 게 나아요. 자컨이 아니라도 볼 수 있는 창구가 있으니까요. 
모르겠습니다. 고잉팀이 보여주는 그림에 지쳐서인지 말이 두서 없게 쓰이긴 했는데 그 만큼 답답하다는 말을 전하고 싶었습니다. 세븐틴과 케미도 잘 맞는 것 같아서 오래 가주셨으면 좋겠는데 이런 거 볼 때마다 답답하네요.",36,2023-09-20T13:10:28Z,,6
