@scavengers19,뮤비의 커스튬과 미술 감독은 아메리카 또는 요롭파 전문가의 식견과 감각을 빌린 것입니까 아니면 한국인의 머리에서 도출된 것입니까? 상당히 세련된 뮤비 연출이군요. 화려한 의상의 색상에 피로하지 않도록 아무런 소품이 없는 백색 공간만으로 여백을 처리한 것은 적절하다.,1,2023-06-15T12:22:47Z

@h-playwithmyhart.4806,"Jonghyun. I want to talk about your musicality first. You possessed a talent that no other will be able to again. I love the power behind your voice. I love the way that you pronounce your words and how you choose to articulate your vocals. Your voice was so pure and thorough, and it is so evident how much passion you had for singing. You were born with a gift, with this instrument and you managed to master it and share it through various styles of songs. I love that your voice could adapt to whatever concept or style that you were met with, and you were able to diversify your lines without losing the qualities that define your voice. There was so much life behind your voice and I really believe it was the foundation of Shinee songs.  It is simply so pure and authentic, which makes it all the more honoring to be able to listen to. You were meant to be singing and warming hearts with your voice. At the same time, you were one of the most phenomenal dancers that I knew. You danced in such a way that made you stand out when executing these, while still blending in with the rest of your members. It is so easy to watch you dance because of the how naturally you moved. When you were on stage, you moved so flawlessly and so comfortably. You moved in a way that demonstrated your personal expression, but still showed all of the characteristics of Shinee’s choreographies. You paid so much attention to all of the details, and your facial expressions are included there as well. You brought Shinee’s choreographies to life and infused into them so much of your experience and professionalism as a dancer.  Overall, I hope you know how legendary of an artist you were and will always be. You are the reason we have music the way we do today, and we needed your contributions to help create its future. You will forever be modeled after and your musical persona will continue to be passed on for years to come. As much as your musicality will always be cherished, your personality will be as well, I know that nobody will hold onto it quite like your members. I can say so confidently that you have freed your members. One of the first reasons I came to figure this out is how vulnerable you have always been with them. I know you dealt with so much and felt so many conflicting emotions, and you must have seen something really valuable in your members to trust those feelings with them.  It is so evident in how close you all were because of how you’ve confided in them and believed in them since the very beginning of your time today.   Because of the time they spent with you and the way that you made them feel, they see the significance in living their lives with no fear. They look up to you because of how resilient and stable you were, all while knowing what you were dealing with. Look at all they’ve accomplished. It is simply because of the life you led that they are able to follow you and do the same. It is you who has strengthened the already unbreakable bond that you all had, and established the familial connection that you all share even further. Your members believe in each other and believe in staying together forever in order to honor you. Every action they take is in your name, and I hope you know that you could not have shown them a greater love. You are the reason they are who they are and that they can live their lives without being held back by anything. Thank you for every second that you spent showing them the greatest love imaginable. I want to personally thank your parents and family for raising you and helping you to become the talented, selfless, and inspiring man that you turned out to be. I know that they are likely the reason you were able to hold on for so long and I know that they meant the world to you. The influence they had on your life is so grand and cannot be missed.  I want to give them my condolences on behalf of all of your other loved ones, but I want to thank them more so for continuing to live out your legacy. I hope you know that you could never disappoint them and all they ever will feel for you is pride. They will always understand you and love you more than anybody else on this Earth, and they live each day continuing what you started. I thank them for continuing to honor you with all that they do; and for spreading the same generosity and love that you did. Your fans keep your family in our hearts always and forever, and will follow their lead in extending your influence in the most respectable way. On the topic of generosity, it is your fans who you likely showed the most grace to; the reason being that you always put us before yourself. You dealt with more than you ever should have, and you still made time to make sure that we were entertained and happy.  All we could have ever hoped for was you taking time that you needed, because just knowing you were there was enough for us. Just your presence was enough for us to feel comfortable and content in our own skin, but you did much more than just be there for us every day. You put in so much work just to make sure we had a piece of you to hold on to; and you never had to exert yourself just to please us. I only hope that in the time that you spent with us, you found us being as supportive as possible. I hope that you did not feel obligated to work hard for us, because as I mentioned earlier, just having you around was all we ever wanted. You put your soul into all that you did for us, and we felt it through every form of communication. You always shared how you were feeling; at least as much as you were comfortable with, and this is all more than you ever had to do. I hope that we were able to offer you at least some relief, because it was you who was saving us each and every day. There are so many fans who are who they are because of the life that you’ve shown us. I hope you don’t feel guilt because similarly to your members, you couldn’t have loved us better and shown us a better life. We could not exist without the love that you continue to show us even without being with us. We will never forget what you’ve done for us and we will continue to live our lives with you in our hearts as we live day to day. Thank you for changing our lives and helping us become who we were meant to be. I know you’ve been through a lot, both professionally and personally. What we know of is likely not even the beginning of the burdens you had to carry. I know that anybody could agree with me when I say that you are easily one of the strongest people for persevering through what you did for so long. It is the hate and the disregard for human life that drove you to make your decision, and I hope you know that we acknowledge the effect that this can have on a person. I know we will never fully understand just what you had to deal with, but we are aware of how strong you had to be to be able to stand up to it even at all. Again, this is just part of what you had to deal with, but you struggled through it with an open heart for so long. I know that facing these fears and hardships helped you to understand more about yourself and you were able to benefit from taking that leap of faith in the end. No matter if you were were a Shinee supporter or not, everybody can learn from how you decided to address what was ailing you. You have taught us not only how to interact with our problems, but also how to treat others in our lives as well. I thank you so much for putting up with what you did and for being so rigid through all of it. It is not easy to brush off those feelings, but you kept your head up for so long, and we are so beyond proud of you for the strength and resilience you’ve shown for the entirety of your life span. You teach us all with your lifestyle choices every single day. I hope you know that your loved ones are all taking this day to commemorate you and the wonderful person that you became. You had a soul too pure for this world, and today, as well as every other day, we recognize and celebrate who you were. I hope you are able to realize just how monumental and historic you are for so many people. It may be hard to view yourself in this way, but just know that your fans and family are going to celebrate your life on this very special day just for you. We will live this day exactly how you would, with nothing but love for you and others in our hearts. Thank you for sacrificing so much just to make Shinee and your own personal creations possible. Thank you for suffering through any pain, fear, anger, confusion, defeat, fear, angst, concern, worry, doubt, fatigue, and so much more just to make us happy. I want you to know we recognize each and every one of your efforts, no matter how minuscule you might think they were. Remember, that they will always change somebody’s mood, day, and life somewhere in the world. Your impact on another’s heart is just that strong. You are the reason so many people believe in themselves and are who they are today, including your members, and I hope you do’t forget that. Thank you so much for your hard work and efforts. You will always be the light in this world, and though nobody is perfect, you will forever be beautiful inside and out to your loved ones. Your love is eternal and will continue to change this world for the better. You will never be forgotten and will forever be honored and remembered! Thank you kindly, great legend, and I hope you are at peace. I hope you found happiness and bliss beyond your wildest dreams. Happy birthday Jonghyun, and we adore you so much. You will always be missed, but celebrated more fiercely! We love you.",15,2023-04-09T04:28:28Z

@h-playwithmyhart.4806,"Jonghyun. I want to talk about your musicality first. You possessed a talent that no other will be able to again. I love the power behind your voice. I love the way that you pronounce your words and how you choose to articulate your vocals. Your voice was so pure and thorough, and it is so evident how much passion you had for singing. You were born with a gift, with this instrument and you managed to master it and share it through various styles of songs. I love that your voice could adapt to whatever concept or style that you were met with, and you were able to diversify your lines without losing the qualities that define your voice. There was so much life behind your voice and I really believe it was the foundation of Shinee songs.  It is simply so pure and authentic, which makes it all the more honoring to be able to listen to. You were meant to be singing and warming hearts with your voice. At the same time, you were one of the most phenomenal dancers that I knew. You danced in such a way that made you stand out when executing these, while still blending in with the rest of your members. It is so easy to watch you dance because of the how naturally you moved. When you were on stage, you moved so flawlessly and so comfortably. You moved in a way that demonstrated your personal expression, but still showed all of the characteristics of Shinee’s choreographies. You paid so much attention to all of the details, and your facial expressions are included there as well. You brought Shinee’s choreographies to life and infused into them so much of your experience and professionalism as a dancer.  Overall, I hope you know how legendary of an artist you were and will always be. You are the reason we have music the way we do today, and we needed your contributions to help create its future. You will forever be modeled after and your musical persona will continue to be passed on for years to come. As much as your musicality will always be cherished, your personality will be as well, I know that nobody will hold onto it quite like your members. I can say so confidently that you have freed your members. One of the first reasons I came to figure this out is how vulnerable you have always been with them. I know you dealt with so much and felt so many conflicting emotions, and you must have seen something really valuable in your members to trust those feelings with them.  It is so evident in how close you all were because of how you’ve confided in them and believed in them since the very beginning of your time today.   Because of the time they spent with you and the way that you made them feel, they see the significance in living their lives with no fear. They look up to you because of how resilient and stable you were, all while knowing what you were dealing with. Look at all they’ve accomplished. It is simply because of the life you led that they are able to follow you and do the same. It is you who has strengthened the already unbreakable bond that you all had, and established the familial connection that you all share even further. Your members believe in each other and believe in staying together forever in order to honor you. Every action they take is in your name, and I hope you know that you could not have shown them a greater love. You are the reason they are who they are and that they can live their lives without being held back by anything. Thank you for every second that you spent showing them the greatest love imaginable. I want to personally thank your parents and family for raising you and helping you to become the talented, selfless, and inspiring man that you turned out to be. I know that they are likely the reason you were able to hold on for so long and I know that they meant the world to you. The influence they had on your life is so grand and cannot be missed.  I want to give them my condolences on behalf of all of your other loved ones, but I want to thank them more so for continuing to live out your legacy. I hope you know that you could never disappoint them and all they ever will feel for you is pride. They will always understand you and love you more than anybody else on this Earth, and they live each day continuing what you started. I thank them for continuing to honor you with all that they do; and for spreading the same generosity and love that you did. Your fans keep your family in our hearts always and forever, and will follow their lead in extending your influence in the most respectable way. On the topic of generosity, it is your fans who you likely showed the most grace to; the reason being that you always put us before yourself. You dealt with more than you ever should have, and you still made time to make sure that we were entertained and happy.  All we could have ever hoped for was you taking time that you needed, because just knowing you were there was enough for us. Just your presence was enough for us to feel comfortable and content in our own skin, but you did much more than just be there for us every day. You put in so much work just to make sure we had a piece of you to hold on to; and you never had to exert yourself just to please us. I only hope that in the time that you spent with us, you found us being as supportive as possible. I hope that you did not feel obligated to work hard for us, because as I mentioned earlier, just having you around was all we ever wanted. You put your soul into all that you did for us, and we felt it through every form of communication. You always shared how you were feeling; at least as much as you were comfortable with, and this is all more than you ever had to do. I hope that we were able to offer you at least some relief, because it was you who was saving us each and every day. There are so many fans who are who they are because of the life that you’ve shown us. I hope you don’t feel guilt because similarly to your members, you couldn’t have loved us better and shown us a better life. We could not exist without the love that you continue to show us even without being with us. We will never forget what you’ve done for us and we will continue to live our lives with you in our hearts as we live day to day. Thank you for changing our lives and helping us become who we were meant to be. I know you’ve been through a lot, both professionally and personally. What we know of is likely not even the beginning of the burdens you had to carry. I know that anybody could agree with me when I say that you are easily one of the strongest people for persevering through what you did for so long. It is the hate and the disregard for human life that drove you to make your decision, and I hope you know that we acknowledge the effect that this can have on a person. I know we will never fully understand just what you had to deal with, but we are aware of how strong you had to be to be able to stand up to it even at all. Again, this is just part of what you had to deal with, but you struggled through it with an fighting heart for so long. I know that facing these fears and hardships helped you to understand more about yourself and you were able to benefit from taking that leap of faith in the end. No matter if you were were a Shinee supporter or not, everybody can learn from how you decided to address what was ailing you. You have taught us not only how to interact with our problems, but also how to treat others in our lives as well. I thank you so much for putting up with what you did and for being so rigid through all of it. It is not easy to brush off those feelings, but you kept your head up for so long, and we are so beyond proud of you for the strength and resilience you’ve shown for the entirety of your life span. You teach us all with your lifestyle choices every single day. I hope you know that your loved ones are all taking this day to commemorate you and the wonderful person that you became. You had a soul too pure for this world, and today, as well as every other day, we recognize and celebrate who you were. I hope you are able to realize just how monumental and historic you are for so many people. It may be hard to view yourself in this way, but just know that your fans and family are going to celebrate your life on this very special day just for you. We will live this day exactly how you would, with nothing but love for you and others in our hearts. Thank you for sacrificing so much just to make Shinee and your own personal creations possible. Thank you for suffering through any pain, fear, anger, confusion, defeat, fear, angst, concern, worry, doubt, fatigue, and so much more just to make us happy. I want you to know we recognize each and every one of your efforts, no matter how minuscule you might think they were. Remember, that they will always change somebody’s mood, day, and life somewhere in the world. Your impact on another’s heart is just that strong. You are the reason so many people believe in themselves and are who they are today, including your members, and I hope you do’t forget that. Thank you so much for your hard work and efforts. You will always be the light in this world, and though nobody is perfect, you will forever be beautiful inside and out to your loved ones. Your love is eternal and will continue to change this world for the better. You will never be forgotten and will forever be honored and remembered! Thank you kindly, great legend, and I hope you are at peace. I hope you found happiness and bliss beyond your wildest dreams. Happy birthday Jonghyun, and we adore you so much. You will always be missed, but celebrated more fiercely!! We love you.",1,2022-04-08T06:56:46Z

So for this week I just started going through all the music on my phone, just letting them play one by one to see what works, and then I hear Minho say ""replay"" TWICE, like he literally 'replayed' the word and pitch and everything, so now I get to talk about SHINee to my classmates :)
I'm happy to introduce them to such a bop
Haven't listened to SHINee a lot since 2017 for obvious reasons and I miss them. They were a big part of my life, so I'm happy to revisit them like this. I think I might be ready to come back to them now? I want to listen to a bunch of SHINee tonight!",185,2020-05-20T03:12:56Z

@kat465k3,"Like as 1 minute and 1 second are different in a day
Everyday you become new
The first of one of those
It means you are a unique
 
Your voice calling me
It came to me lightly and slipped on my ears
Your hand which is covering mine
That lead me to the bright world I’ve never seen
 
You’re ‘1 of 1’ girl
Only one
There’s no doubt, my answer is you
You’re ‘1 of 1’ girl
It’s perfect
Can’t be compared you are already
The only reason in my life
 
The one name of you
Like got a right color Yeah
Like a sweet song around in my ears
It’s perfect harmony, I’m kept calling you
 
Forever like as the first feeling Replay (Replay)
Your love shines newly
I’m again Fallin’ fallin’ for you (Come here)
It’s not boring to say ‘I love you’ to you
 
Sweet kiss
The steps to each other
We do eyecontact by accident
Why are you so beautiful
(Let’s go) You’re my baby
 
You’re ‘1 of 1’ girl
Only one
There’s no doubt, my answer is you
You’re ‘1 of 1’ girl
It’s perfect
Can’t be compared you are already
The only reason in my life
 
‘1 of 1’ girl
Only one
You fill me up without space
You’re ‘1 of 1’ girl
It’s perfect
Can’t be replaceable you
The only reason in my life
 
I’m dyed so deeply to you and getting changed
When my mind is full of light of you
I’ll light on you
 
You’re ‘1 of 1’ girl
Only one
There’s no doubt, my answer is you
You’re ‘1 of 1’ girl
It’s perfect
Can’t be compared you are already
The only reason in my life
 
1 of 1′ girl
Only one
You fill me up without space
You’re ‘1 of 1’ girl
It’s perfect
Can’t be replaceable you
The only reason in my life
 
You’re ‘1 of 1’ girl
You’re ‘1 of 1’ girl
There’s no doubt, my answer is you
You’re ‘1 of 1’ girl
(‘1 of 1’ girl ‘1 of 1’)
You can’t be compared with anyone
One & Only I want only you

@norakel,"하루 중에 1분 1초 다르듯
날마다 넌 새로워져
하나 중에 그중에 제일 첫 번째
유일하단 뜻인 거야 너
나를 부르는 네 목소리
사뿐하게 다가와서 내 귓가에 미끄러져
손에 감겨오는 네 손길이
처음 만나는 저 눈부신
세상으로 나를 이끌어
넌 ‘1 of 1’ girl
오직 하나
틀림없이 나의 답인 너
넌 ‘1 of 1’ girl
완벽해
비교할 수 없는 넌 이미
내 세상의 유일한 의미
하나의 이름 너라는 사람에
꼭 들어맞는 컬러를 입힌 듯 Yeah
귓가에 스친 달콤한 노래처럼
완벽하게 어울려 자꾸 너를 부르게 돼
처음의 그 느낌처럼 언제나 Replay
(Replay)
네 사랑은 새롭게 빛나
난 또다시 Fallin’ fallin’ for you
(Come here)
사랑한다는 말도 네겐 지겹지 않아
달콤한 입맞춤
서로에게만 맞춘 발걸음
아무 예고 없이 두 눈이 마주친
너는 왜 이리 아름다운지
(Let’s go) You’re my baby
넌 ‘1 of 1’ girl
오직 하나
틀림없이 나의 답인 너
넌 ‘1 of 1’ girl
완벽해
비교할 수 없는 넌 이미
내 세상의 유일한 의미
‘1 of 1’ girl
오직 하나
빈틈없이 나를 채우지
넌 ‘1 of 1’ girl
완벽해
대신할 수 없는 넌 오직
내 세상의 유일한 의미
이토록 깊이 너에게 스며 변하고 있어
널 닮은 빛으로 밝힌 맘이 가득 차오를 때
내가 너를 비춰 줄게

@nita_log,"SHINee through SM never plagiarized others song. 

SM buy from the owners not the artist. Credit them in the album. Their songs are legal. You should check the composers, the arrangements, the writers, the lyricists.

About concepts.....there are not plagiarism, I think it's just inspiring, you should check the MV director, the producer, the conceptor, the crews.

Well talking about that youtuber, if she/he is proven doing plagiarism SM will take action. 
But until now nothing news from SM. It means SM don't care her/him. She/he is just minority.

You guys....found out that you never buy SHINee album. 

Aaaah capek gw nulis dlm bhs Inggris.....banyak bego nya yg komentar. Padahal org asing harusnya lbh pintar wkkwkwkwk.

they have done a lot for their community, key himself alone donated to a charity right before enlisting in 2019.

there’s so much that i left out but i just wanted to lay down some basics and facts about our beloved 5 boys. if you’re new to the fandom i welcome you with warm arms and i am happy you’re here. please be good to our 5 amazing artists. they deserve all the support and love.  welcome to the shinee world <3",3875,2019-04-11T00:47:50Z

@ondubu52,"I lost my dog, she used to keep me company especially when sad, she would sit there with me and sometimes even cry when I did, as we both listened to shinee or Jonghyun. Mostly just Jonghyun when ever I was sad. But she passed. And then Jonghyun did too. I now cry for both of them alone. And often. It's so hard all by myself. It's still hard for me to listen to his voice. I wish this wasnt real. I have stopped listening to Kpop and stopped watching dramas. I've been listening and watching for longer than shinee has been around. I am 23. But they were the first group who completely snatched my heart. I just never thought they would be the ones to cause me the most pain. I love you Kim Jonghyun. But this hurts so much. I go back to that day when I first got the news early morning a lot and sometimes I relive it often and  those first 5 months were awful.. I became Ill, I couldn't sleep or eat. I would lay and cry non stop. I would go to work and burst into an uncontrollable fit of tears. I walked around without a light to follow.  Its become easier but my heart goes to that day, and those months often. I dont think itll ever stop hurting. I just hope I can one day listen to you again with a calm heart and a heart full of love again. I don't think I'll live to see the day. Kim Jonghyun I love you. ♡ you did well.

@DrAmrita14,"SHINEE 1o1 ENGLISH LYRICS
Just like each minute and each second are different
Day by day, you become new
You’re the first of the first
That means you’re the only one
Your voice that calls out to me
Lightly comes and slips into my ear
Your touch that I can feel in my hands
Brings me to the dazzling world that
I’ve never been in before

You’re 1 of 1 girl
Only one
You are my answer, without a doubt
You’re 1 of 1 girl
It’s perfect
You’re already incomparable
You’re the only meaning of my world

A person like you has a name of Only One
As if you’ve put on the perfect color, yeah
Like a sweet song that passes my ear
You perfectly match, I keep singing about you

Like the feeling I felt for the first time, always replay
(replay)
Your love newly shines
Once again, I’m fallin, fallin for you
(come here)
I could never get sick of saying I love you

A sweet kiss
Footsteps that only match each other
Without any warning, our eyes met
Why are you so beautiful?
(Let’s go) You’re my baby

You’re 1 of 1 girl
Only one
You are my answer, without a doubt
You’re 1 of 1 girl
It’s perfect
You’re already incomparable
You’re the only meaning of my world

1 of 1 girl
Only one
You fill me up without any empty spots
You’re 1 of 1 girl
It’s perfect
You’re irreplaceable
You’re the only meaning of my world

I’m so deeply into you, I’m changing
When my heart, that is lit up with your light, rises up
I will shine on you

You’re 1 of 1 girl
Only one
You are my answer, without a doubt
You’re 1 of 1 girl
It’s perfect
You’re already incomparable
You’re the only meaning of my world

1 of 1 girl
Only one
You fill me up without any empty spots
You’re 1 of 1 girl
It’s perfect
You’re irreplaceable
You’re the only meaning of my world

You’re 1 of 1 girl
You’re 1 of 1 girl
You are my answer, without a doubt
You’re 1 of 1 girl
(1 of 1 girl 1 of 1)
You can’t be compared with anyone else
One & Only I only want you.",46,2018-12-14T15:11:17Z

@queenk2738,"Jonghyun has such a beautiful voice. When on a talk show, a fan letter asked if he’s done surgery because he’s looked different from before. I think he just looked skinnier than he used to be and it’s probably because of exhaustion and depression. At the time he just smiled and said nothing. When I watch him talking in the videos, he talks so gently and softly; and I know people who are depressed including me would talk like this while I was in a deep depression.

@DrAmrita14,"SHINEE 1o1 ENGLISH LYRICS
Just like each minute and each second are different
Day by day, you become new
You’re the first of the first
That means you’re the only one
Your voice that calls out to me
Lightly comes and slips into my ear
Your touch that I can feel in my hands
Brings me to the dazzling world that
I’ve never been in before

You’re 1 of 1 girl
Only one
You are my answer, without a doubt
You’re 1 of 1 girl
It’s perfect
You’re already incomparable
You’re the only meaning of my world

A person like you has a name of Only One
As if you’ve put on the perfect color, yeah
Like a sweet song that passes my ear
You perfectly match, I keep singing about you

Like the feeling I felt for the first time, always replay
(replay)
Your love newly shines
Once again, I’m fallin, fallin for you
(come here)
I could never get sick of saying I love you

A sweet kiss
Footsteps that only match each other
Without any warning, our eyes met
Why are you so beautiful?
(Let’s go) You’re my baby

You’re 1 of 1 girl
Only one
You are my answer, without a doubt
You’re 1 of 1 girl
It’s perfect
You’re already incomparable
You’re the only meaning of my world

1 of 1 girl
Only one
You fill me up without any empty spots
You’re 1 of 1 girl
It’s perfect
You’re irreplaceable
You’re the only meaning of my world

I’m so deeply into you, I’m changing
When my heart, that is lit up with your light, rises up
I will shine on you

You’re 1 of 1 girl
Only one
You are my answer, without a doubt
You’re 1 of 1 girl
It’s perfect
You’re already incomparable
You’re the only meaning of my world

1 of 1 girl
Only one
You fill me up without any empty spots
You’re 1 of 1 girl
It’s perfect
You’re irreplaceable
You’re the only meaning of my world

You’re 1 of 1 girl
You’re 1 of 1 girl
You are my answer, without a doubt
You’re 1 of 1 girl
(1 of 1 girl 1 of 1)
You can’t be compared with anyone else

사뿐하게 다가와서

꼭 들어맞는 컬러를 입힌 듯 Yeah 

귓가에 스친 달콤한 노래처럼 
완벽하게 어울려 자꾸 너를 부르게 돼 

처음의 그 느낌처럼 언제나 Replay Replay 
네 사랑은 새롭게 빛나 
난 또다시 Fallin' fallin' for you 
사랑한다는 말도 네겐 지겹지 않아 
달콤한 입맞춤 서로에게만 맞춘 발걸음 
아무 예고 없이 두 눈이 마주친 너는 왜 이리 아름다운지

yes we all cried and still crying for him but seriously SHINee is in the worse situation than you are and they need our support being a fan is not just for happy times but it's for all the time whether it's happy or really sad so if you don't support them in situation like this then maybe the next time you are crying and having regret is the time that they disbanded( that I really hope this will never happen) so stop being selfish! support them or just stop commenting things that only have negative energy and makes other shawols (who are still supporting them)feel sad!!!

@foortunecookie_,"this is one of my fave song by Shinee, and finally after one year I'm able to listen to it again and I'm crying so hard right now..I don't think I will ever accept this..of course sometimes Jonghyun seemed to be sad, he talked about mental illness a lot but I still don't understand it..most of the times he looked so happy, he had loving family, 4 brothers and milion of fans who love him..this is so hard for me, it makes me so sad that we will never hear new Shinee song with all of them..I respest Minho, Key, Onew and Taemin so much that they decided to comeback, I love their new album so much but it's not the same without Jonghyun and never will be..his voice was one of kind, and without him something is missing..seeing his beautiful smile in this mv breaks my heart into a milion pieces, I wish he will be still with us and I can take at least half of his pain away..thinking how he suffered before he leaved us..ending your life is not the way! life is beautiful, I bet there are many people who loves us, we still have so many things to do and to see, there is always way to get out of problems..sometimes I wish I would not love Shinee and their music this much because now I will be less hurt and not crying that many times :(",0,2018-08-27T21:22:14Z

@ayrkn,A German YouTuber girl named “Dagi Bee” has posted a Roast yourself video. And the beat is from SHINee’s song 1of1. But she mentioned that she inspired herself from Bruno Mars which I don’t think because it’s not even close like SHINee’s song. Many Shawols write a comment under the video and saying that this beat is from shinee but the German fans don’t believe it. We want to reach SM so they can see this..,28,2018-08-09T11:26:43Z

@ni5a9,"I only discovered this group yesterday and already have loaded my phone with lots of they're songs. especially they're solos (Jonghyun and Taemin). I'm very sorry for Jonghyun not only for his talent but also as a human being who struggled a lot in his life till that point. i wish could have found the strength to endure a little more, but in the end, that's life and we are just human beings with all the strengths and weaknesses we get. I really hope that now he can rest in peace and wish for his family and friends to live in peace with his joyful memories. 
regarding this song, I'm curious to know how come Onew only sings sitting and never dances. did anything happen to him at that time? BTW his voice is amazing :D",9,2018-06-21T13:29:25Z

@stevepark5165,"I don't want to do this anymore. It hurts so bad I just can't do it. When Jonghyun left, I wanted to leave too. I would never end my life, but I just want the pain to stop. But all I have is pain. I try to accept them as a group with 4 members, but my heart can't let go of Jonghyun. I don't talk with anyone about how I feel because I just feel weak if I do. I don't want to talk about my problems. I just miss Jonghyun so much I don't know what to do anymore. I need strength when I feel this way, but all I can do is cry in my room at night in the dark, silencing my sobs. I'm just tired of this. My step dad also passed away in September and I just can't handle the pain from that too. I feel like so many people I love and care about are dying. What do I do?",1,2018-06-16T08:36:16Z

They are one of the best artists out there. Every year, they are just getting better and better. Yes, I stan other groups such as BTS and Seventeen but to me, they can't compare to Shinee.

@FELIXB3,I've been seeing mainly from people who only recently joined the fandom bcuz Jong died or after he died they became more interested in only him for whatever personal reason. But people saying Shawols didnt care about him or we didnt try to help him or we treated him badly. I need to set the record if you find one fandom that cares deeply about each member its this one. We knew Jong had depression it was no mystery we tried to uplift him with positive comments & feed back & keep him protected from antis. Jong's depression just happened to be severe that he probably needed someone physical & not just online comments to lift his spirits. Do not come into this fandom telling us we caused his depression or we never loved him. I assure you we loved him & we love all of SHINee so much & only want to give them the world.,44,2018-03-11T08:30:44Z

@arthurfleckfan,"It's amazing how I always find myself coming back to this video. I know he passed 2 weeks ago, but I still can't believe that such an amazing man took his own life due to how difficult being in the kpop music industry is. It's even worse when your own family doesn't understand why you still cry about it every night. If I could turn back time and somehow help him dear god I would. He didn't deserve this, he was the kindest soul on this planet, and not a single day will pass by that I don't think of him.",1,2018-01-05T18:00:47Z

@yerindubs1861,"They're too good to exist, really.
Jonghyun was a fucking human masterpiece. He adds something special to the song.

I think SHINee's musical career as five members ended the best way it could've ended.

Ofc it's a shame they hadn't released more albums and MVs before the tragic loss... But I think this song leaves a good taste for an ending...

I don't even know why I am talking about this... First of all, I would have wished this hadn't happened, that Jonghyun hadn't gone through all this pain...

Although I'm not a Shawol, I was pretty affected. I understood him really well... 

He was a too good soul for this world... Poor baby...

I wish I could relive the feeling I had when I first discovered kpop through SHINee, watching Hello Baby and Yunhannam for the first times. My sense of nostalgia and euphoria in a sense has been replaced with a really sad and empty void. SHINee was like that safe group that was always there no matter what other drama was going on in the k community, they were always okay even when their solo careers took off. They were inseparable.

@notclg,"Last week I was starting to get into Shinee, I mean really getting into them, I've been so obssesed with them lately. The day before Jonghyun passed away I remember I couldn't stop listening all of their songs while working. I guess I wanted to become a Shawol so bad, watching their videos, falling in love with each one of them, specially Key and Jonghyun for some reason. Then the next day I read the news and I just couldn't believe it, I couldn't hold tears, I'm so freaking sad right now. I don't even feel I deserve to become a Shawol now. I mean, I feel It's too late. Almost 10 years without supporting them, supporting Jonghyun.. I don't know what to do now. The rest of the members must feel terrible, and I can't do nothing, I can't pretend I've been a Shawol for so long and say I love them so much because I wasn't one when the 5 were together. I wish so much I could've noticed their music and talent at least 1 year ago, and not 2 months ago... I wasn't even into kpop the first months of 2016... All I can say to the members, his family and fans is to please, Stay strong. 
Shawols, you deserve the whole world for supporting this amazing and talented group until now, including the smile of a beautiful boy which I missed in its best moments and I hate myself for that. You need to know how lucky you all are to have lived that at the right time.
Jonghyun you can rest in peace now. I swear I'll listen to all of your songs and appreciate the talented and bright man you really was, that's the only thing you deserve and the only thing I can do now...",12,2017-12-22T22:07:15Z

@jessicajlanier,"I can remember the moment exactly that I fell in love with Jonghyun. It was in March of this year when me and my cousin were on the way to SHINee's concert in Dallas. She biased Jonghyun, I biased Minho, but she insisted on having me bias Jonghyun as well. So, she started playing all of his solo songs. It was after that car ride and seeing them live, that I really fell in love with him. His songs were brilliant, he was a genius, and just something about him made him REALLY stand out. He was so special. SHINee has always been THAT group that I consider unique to my heart. I can't tell you how much I love them... my hear hurts, and it will probably continue hurting... but I have peace of mind knowing that Jonghyun is at peace, wherever he is.",1,2017-12-22T06:05:49Z

It's really hard guys... I think we can't even imagine how deep his pain was. I don't believe in heaven but I still feel somehow he's better now... Having to deal with such a huge sorrow it's like dying a lil bit everyday and I honestly don't want this for our Jonghyun.
I'll never be able to watch his smiley eyes again without thinking about the pain behind them. All the happy sweet memories will now taste bittersweet.

@anhanh5528,"I hate to deal with the fact that these songs would never be the same anymore. Not only because our beloved Jonghyun's not here with us, but also because it can never feel the same anymore. Through the past few days, I've listened to SHINee over and over and over again and realized such energetic and enthusiastic songs could ever be this sad. When I scroll down to see the comments, I always expect to see positive and loved comments about the songs and the bands. And now it'll never come usual again. We will never only talk about how Key is so handsome, Taemin is so cute in that hairstyle, Minho needs more lines, Onew's voice is so warm and Jonghuyn is killing those high notes as well as dance moves. Instead, all we feel and want to express is our pain, our recall, our late encouragement. I wish all this stuff is just a bad nightmare and when we wake up tomorrow and open Replay, Lucifer, Ring Ding Dong, Hello,... It's only about how cool they are and maybe a little debate about Jonghyunie and Lil Taemin who's the handsom-er between two fangirls. I'm sorry I can't think straight to write something better.  😭😭😭😭😭😭 Just still can't believe that he's gone...",86,2017-12-21T18:04:33Z

@2kool4u78,"I bought the album that this was featured on today because I needed something to help me cope.  I went to the store to try and buy something Jonghyun related and when I got there almost everything was gone (which I expected because of what happened).  I asked if they happened to have any more merchandise and luckily they still had two albums left.  I decided to buy the album since I wanted something, though I was disappointed that I could not get Jonghyun's album.  Though when I got to the car I opened the album and found that it had Jonghyun's photo card.  I immediately broke down because I felt happy that in the end I was able to have something to remember him by, but also because the situation still really upsets me.  Anyway, I feel he was looking out for me when I picked that album.  Like he was letting me have a piece of him without me expecting it.  I just wanted to share my experience.  Thank you Jonghyun.

@chevelle921,"To be honest, it's been three days and the news didn't feel real to me but after watching this MV again it kind of hit me that we'll never be able to see our Jonghyun perform this or any other SHINee song with the other members and the thought of it hurts so bad. Jonghyun, I'm sorry that you felt this way, I'm sorry that there was nothing anyone could do to help you but we will never forget you and we will carry on legacy and continue to support SHINee as OT5. I love you so much, my bias and now my angel. 

And to fellow Shawol's, Jonghyun fans or simply anyone who's been affected, just know that there is always someone to talk to, whether it be a friend on the internet or even a stranger, there is always someone willing to listen and help. Stay Strong and keep your heads up <3",0,2017-12-20T12:38:34Z

Seriously. I never was a big Shinee fan, I don't even know that much about kpop. All I know is that you were my favorite.

I picked Jonghyun as my bias mainly because I liked his character and his personality in one of the comedy videos I watched of Shinee (I believe it was Over Flowers??) Anyways, you will be deeply missed. I am so sorry about how you felt, know that you NEVER have to be ashamed of who you love, and who your attracted to.

Like he sacrificed him self to give us a hint that we have to open our eyes and do something with this. If he suffered like this I can promise you that other artists also do. 

So this is what I recommend you to do; 
- If you have a friend that suffers, THEN HELP HIM/HER! Not just watch. Even if it is just a little thing then, it can end like it did with Jonghyun.
- This one is to all managers out there. Stop treating them like they are an animal. THEY ARE HUMANS JUST LIKE US! A HUMAN CAN NOT STAND THAT MUCH STRESS!

Take this as a hint to become better. Try to find the positive sides with it. Even if it looks just like a deep, endless hole then. There is always some positive sides with it

@mymisteriu172,"I'm going to be leaving this note everywhere I can. Today is 12.18.2017, also known as the death date of the beloved Kim Jonghyun. I want this message to get to everyone:

I don't care if you stanned Jonghyun, if he was your bias, if you didn't even know him, I don't want your sympathy. We don't need you empathy. 

""I don't stan SHINee, but I just want to be there for the people who loved Jonghyun and SHINee.""

""Why would he do this? He had everything and he lead a good life?""

""Why would you do this?! We loved you!""

Let me get this straight. JONGHYUN is not just an idol, NOT just a celebrity, NOT just a role model, NOT just a member of SHINee, he was also a freaking HUMAN. AND BEFORE YOU ALL go out there throwing out all your sympathy and sorrowness, I just want to say before you do all of that please understand. Please understand that Jonghyun was a human with emotions. Please understand that he suffered to. And like me, do not judge a book by its covers. It was obvious through eyes, he was happy, we THOUGHT that he was happy. Please don't bury him with words. You know what's upsetting though? There are fans in the comments like ""Why would you do this to us? We loved you!"" They're blaming him for taking his own life and making themselves look like the victims. It's so annoying, I get that they miss him, but he doesn't owe anything to them. I wish they would just let him rest in piece. He obviously thought it through before doing it. You know he even rented out a place in order to do it, he really did thought it through. 

And the other comments, ""He was loved, why would he take his life?"" WHAT YOU SEE ON THE OUTSIDE CAN BE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT""S ON THE INSIDE. Also, ""What could have happened to make him take his own life?"" HONEY, HAVE YOU HEARD OF DEPRESSION.

*AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT AN ANGEL HE IS.* HE'S  DONATING HIS ORGANS AND LEAVING HIS *INHERITANCE TO HIS SISTER*

And if you ever see those people like I have, ""Y'all go spam ""Oof"" and roast the people on there. (Jonghyun's instagram). This KPOP singer who committed suicide and it's funny triggering their fans."": PLease do not let these people get their fun annoyuing you, mocking Jonghyun's death. Ignore them, repot them, do not pick a fight like they are. You know why? It's because we are not them, we DO NOT MOCK ONE""S DEATH. We are called human for a reason and it's time we start acting like them.

I hope you all understand the main issue. Ignore hte fact that he was famous, an idol, he had skin and bones like all of us. He has a heart. Don't go asking why and go support. Support those who are struggling. TAKE THIS AS A WAKE UP CALL.

@gracerobinson11,"I know I'm not the only one saying this, but here's another voice.
Dear, jonghyun
We love you. We knew about your depression....now idk if SM did anything. We all knew you were depressed, but I don't think to the extreme. It saddens me that you were in so much pain. It was obvious in your eyes (maybe it's just a reflection of how I feel idk) but you sing and smile with such passion it was easy to pass off. We don't know the pain you went through...we will never understand just how painful living was for you...you thought death was the best option...and that's sad. We all understand...it wasn't your fault...something (or many thing) pushed you over the edge... I just hope you can sing your heart out in heaven...we'll all continue to support SHINee even if they disband. For many of us, you guys were our introduction to kpop, myself included. I hope you're not disappointed in yourself. You shouldn't be. None of us are mad, and if we are, we're mad at the world, not you. Keep singing up in heaven... you deserve peace...again we love you so much...you will be absolutely missed.
Love, myself and probably many Shawols.

To my fellow Shawols and other fandoms,
We will continue to support SHINee...we all need to be supported and support each other. We're all grieving, we're all shocked. Maybe there was something we could have collectively done, I don't know. But what I do know, jonghyun loved us. He loved music. He loved producing music for us and everyone. While we may never understand why, we need to collectively understand that he didn't want to live. That life was far too painful for him. I hate to say it (I mean he was my bias so this is especially hard) but we need to forgive. I understand your probably going to be mad, and that's okay. I will be right beside you in that anger. But we can't get mad at jonghyun. He wasn't in the right state of mind and unfortunately that state of mind, took him away. We need to be gentle to not only ourselves, but each other and especially the other members of SHINee. I'm sure you may want to blame the others. I will too, but they aren't at fault. They didn't see through the smiling sunshine. Really hardly anyone of us did. The only thing we can blame, is time. Time took him away. So just be gentle. We'll all be on edge and very sad. So please if your depressed and even contemplating suicide, back away from the news, log off of everything, all social media and just take time to be with family and friends. Tell them you love them. Reach out to suicide hotlines, if you are considering suicide. And if you are, believe me and remember this. Suicide may end your pain, but it's a life time sadness for your friends and family. I love you all. I loved being part of this fandom. So many jokes. So much laughter. Let's keep it that way and still have fun (again even if they disband) let's support taemin and the others if they decide to go solo. They may also decide to stay together and if they do, we'll support them.
One last thing,  jonghyun isn't gone. He's with all of us. And I feel like he was with every single one of us today. He didn't want to hurt us. He wanted to find peace for himself. He'll be watching us until we're past the five stages. Again I love you all. 
Your fellow Shawol, CS

I'm sure Jonghyun wouldn't want us to be sad. Let's pray for his family, members, and friends. 

Just know that you're never alone in this world, there'll always be someone to talk to. If you're going through a rough time right now, you can do it! You're strong, you're worth it and you deserve it. I wouldn't want anyone in this fandom to suffer the same way Jonghyun did. We all can do this somehow.

They are one of the few groups who you never question anything, you just know in your heart will remain 5 forever.

I was so excited when I saw the Night Goblin preview of Jonghyun with Nu'est JR. Thought how cute he looks. I never would have expected this. I am so lost right now, this doesnt even feel like real life.

To Shawols. Dear God… im so fucking sorry for you, his members and family.

Kim Jonghyun was one of the few people in this industry who stood up for what he believed in no matter what the backlash. He openly supported the LGBT+ community and talked openly about mental health, he was critisized for both. A beautiful man, with one of the best voices this industry will ever know. One of the kindest hearts this world will ever know. Kim Jonghyun is a legend that will never be forgotten for his humanity and talent.

Kim Jonghyun will be loved eternally. Today the world gained an angel. Rest in Peace my sweet Prince.

Today, I lost Kim Jonghyun, a bias that I love with all my hearts, a bias that I met when I was 8 years old, a bias that caught my eyes the first time I saw their debut photos back in 2009.

Today I'm thinking about how I attempted suicide 4 times and how SHINee was by my side every time I didn't success.

Today I'm sending all my prayers and all my courage for people who truly love him for who he is.

@134sophiek,"To all of the other fandoms, thank you. Shawols really appreciate your support and your respect to Jonghyun and his memory. SHINee haven't lost a member, they've gained an angel. We are in mourning right now and I know that I'm in the stage of denial. Which is why I have a favour to ask all of you, all of you reading this, please whoever you love, whatever group you Stan, please go and tell your idols you love them. Jonghyun spoke often about his struggles, in his songs, interviews and in general. He was very open about it. Unfortunately Korea isn't very open on mental health issues, but I hope now they are. Jonghyuns death has come as a shock to all of us, I really shouldn't be saying anything because my heart is broken, but I feel it's important. Even the industry seems shocked as a lot of other idols are paying condolences and canceling schedules. Even Ex- EXO members Luhan and Tao have given condolences, that just shows how much of an impact Jonghyun had. He was a true inspiration to many, but it seems he didn't know it. In many conversations it seems like Jonghyun didn't feel he was good enough, he didn't feel he was doing enough. He seemed to not only have depression, but a bit of a lack of confidence in himself. I wish as a Shawol I would of told him more often how much I love him, how talented he is and to be strong, how much he meant to so many people, how much we all appreciated him and that he is amazing. Jonghyun believed in a lot of things and stood up for people of all kinds. SHINee as a whole are a very respected group, but Jonghyun as an artist was truly magnificent. Jonghyun talked about his troubles because he wanted to change things, he wanted to bring awareness to it. I feel like as a Shawol, I failed him, I couldn't save him. I should of told him I love him and made it better. This is a heartache Shawols are going to have to deal with. But, if one thing can come from this, it's change. His legacy can live on and in respect of his memory we can change things. Idols are humans, they have struggles they make mistakes, please start identifying this. Stop the fanwars, stop the hate and the trolls and the antis. Everything, just stop. We need to start helping these idols, we need to start respecting them and what they go through. Their lives are the most important thing, over all else. If your idols are sad, please try and cheer them up. If they tell you they are it's because they trust you and they're looking for your support, please give it to them. If they need to take a break, please understand and wait for them. You can wait for them. There is no time longer than forever and we've lost Jonghyun forever, so please wait for your idols. Please people of other fandoms, when idols get into scandals, be careful of your words, don't jump to conclusions and hate, they're  still human and they make mistakes, your words can not only affect them, but the people who love them to. Shawols have been trying to support OT5 the best we could because they're a family. But all this time, the media and antis kept trying to tear SHINee apart, not noticing Jonghyun suffering behind it all, that should of mattered. SHINee was important to Jonghyun, his members were like family. Jonghyun isn't the first idol to go through this, I thought T.O.P would of been a lesson to people about treating idols better, luckily he survived but his near death experience should of taught people that they're humans to, but it didn't. Things stayed the same, got worse even and now we've lost our Jonghyun forever. This is real, he's really gone. We can't bring him back, but his death can mean something. His legacy can carry on so that he doesn't die in vain. Please, respect the idols as humans, care for them, have an understanding for them. Whoever is reading this, if you're a multifandom or one group only, it doesn't matter. Go and tell your idols that you love them, go and tell them they're important and they're amazing and they mean everything to you. Tell them that you're there for them, that you support them. Make them feel loved and appreciated. Because we can't tell Jonghyun these things anymore. You can change things, you can help your idols, you can protect them. Jonghyun is our guardian angel now, he looks down upon SHINee, he will protect them. His life had so much purpose and he deserved so much better. I don't know what will happen with SHINee now, but they will always be OT5, Jonghyun will not be forgotten. I hope the industry learns to help and support their idols better and learns that mental health issues are real and I hope that all of you appreciate your idols and care for them. Because you should and because you can. We can't tell Jonghyun we love him, but you can still tell your idols that you love them. Every idol is important to their fans and to their groups, SHINee have lost Jonghyun in the worst possible way. So please, appreciate your idols, appreciate that they're with you. No matter how big or small their problems seem, care for them and protect them. Shawols have been wishing to see OT5 to stand on stage together again for so long and now we never will again. One of my biggest dreams was to see SHINee perform and to meet them. I knew Jonghyun was a kind soul and I wanted to meet him and tell him how special he is. I'll never get the chance now. Shawols that have met him or had the chance to see him sing live, please cherish these memories and all of us can cherish the memory of him. Everyone else please cherish your idols and the time you still have with them. But all of us, please let Jonghyuns death serve as much of a purpose as his life did, let's all remember him for who he was. Jonghyun our sweet angel, I miss you now and I will forever. You will always remain in our hearts and we will always love you. SHINee are always going to be five and you will always be with us. Sleep easy my love, you'll be okay now. 💙💙",3,2017-12-18T20:40:32Z

@suzuka3785,"Jonghyun, notre merveilleux Jonghyun. 

Vingt-sept années d’existence sur notre horrible planète bleue. Il t’en a fallu du courage, pour arriver jusque-là… Si tu savais comme je t’en suis reconnaissante, d’avoir essayé de vivre. Tu étais ce genre de gars splendide, qui, à chaque fois que la vie lui jouait un mauvais tour, se relevait toujours, la tête haute. Je crois Jonghyun, que tu n’avais pas conscience de l’être exceptionnelle que tu représentais. Ce type de personne si rare, capable de mettre ses problèmes de côté pour arranger ceux des autres. Tu étais si unique. Pour être honnête, tu m’as sauvé plusieurs fois du précipice, de la noyade ; tu étais celui qui me faisait rire gorge la déployée, qui me faisait sourire à en avoir mal aux joues, quand tout allait mal dans mon quotidien. Parce que c’est ça, c’est tout à fait ça, tu étais le Soleil lui-même, capable d’éclairer de bonheur de générations entières. 

Pour avoir rendu ma vie meilleure, pour m’avoir offert un espoir, je te remercie, je crie, j’hurle, je pleure ma reconnaissance infinie.

Et aussi, je suis désolée. Désolée d’avoir été impuissante face à tes souffrances. Désolée de n’être qu’une fille inutile, incapable de rendre l’espoir que tu m’as jadis accordé. Désolée de n’être que « cette fan » parmi tant d’autres. Désolée que tu aies dû dissimuler ta vraie personnalité, tes véritables sentiments toutes ces années pour ne pas inquiéter. 

Tu t’es suicidé. 

Tu ne trouvais pas ta place dans ce pauvre monde. Et diable, qu’est-ce que je te comprends, je connais cette sensation par cœur, moi aussi. Alors, maintenant que tu en as l’opportunité, libère-toi de tes maux, envole-toi dans le vent, profite de cette délivrance. Je souhaite de tout mon cœur que ton âme trouve la paix intérieure.

Courage aux collègues, à la famille, à tous les proches de Kim Jonghyun. Courage à Taemin, Key, Onew et Minho, qui ont perdu bien plus qu’un membre de SHINee, bien plus qu’un frère de cœur, aujourd’hui. Courage à toutes les Shawols, qui comme moi, sentent leur monde se détruire. 

Kim Jonghyun, notre merveilleux Kim Jonghyun, notre petite légende. Nous ne t’oublierons jamais. Jamais, jamais, jamais. 


Je t’aimais comme je t’aimerais toujours.",3,2017-12-18T19:40:24Z

SHINee will, always and forever, be five. I hope the other members will be able to find solace in those close to them and take time to properly grieve. That being said, I hope SM will be respectful to Jonghyun's passing and let everyone take time to mourn the loss of this great man.

我永遠記得人生的第一次看演唱會是SHINee台北二巡
門票跟手燈都還好好收在抽屜裡
我記得在我年少時很喜歡你
因為我現在依然很喜歡你
然而無法再給你更多的掌聲了。

謝謝你的歌聲帶領我認識KPOP
謝謝你爽朗的笑容支撐我的黑夜
謝謝你溫暖的歌聲陪伴過我的青春
謝謝你的表演讓我開心的說:我是SHINee的粉絲

@user-uu5dc6wr6h,"He's an artist that will always remain in my memory, especially from when I was 11 to 17 and onforth. Jonghyun has contributed so much to my adolescence but I know he'll stay onto my adulthood, too.

He was an artist that was unafraid to express his genuine thoughts, his androgyny, and his opinions. He is the first man I've really seen be so open to showing his emotions and was so encouraging of others to do the same. He was talented beyond measure both in terms of singing and in writing. He was loving and so caring. Shawols were always grateful for his kindness to his fans, to the closeness he allowed. He was accepting and respectful of everyone.

As an artist and an idol, he made his family, his members, and his fans so happy. He worked his way out of poverty and made his family so happy, something only some achieve. He has made so many songs that I'll be listening to forever. I know that he's touched a lot of people through his music.

No matter what, I'm so grateful that I knew that Kim Jonghyun existed and that I lived in the same time he did. And I'm so grateful that people after his time, after our time, will be able to see the marks he's left and feel sad that they weren't as lucky as us.

He was beautiful in so many ways. He'll really never be forgotten now. The world lost a really amazing person today.
Kim Jonghyun, I love you. We love you.",1,2017-12-18T13:22:09Z

@abbyrichmond8123,"And just like that my life has been turned upside down. My first ever Kpop bias. Gone. Jonghyun, words cannot describe how much you will be missed by the Kpop community, especially myself. You made me smile more times than I can count and I just wish that if you could have just smiled once more how differently this night could have turned out to be.  
Well, you're where you belong now anyway...with the angels. and I know we will still be able to hear your angelic voice if not even better than before. 
You meant so much to me and millions of other people and I just hope you know that your energy will live on for the many years to come. 
My heart goes out to Jonghyun's family, friends, SHINee and most definitely the rest of us Shawols. We don't have to suffer alone. If you need someone to talk to, I'm here, reach out to other Shawols too. We lost a beautiful soul but I know together with SHINee we will still stand brave.
I've had to reread this several times because what good is it when you can't see through a mass of tears?...

Fly high 김종현.

@marymanson,GOWD I am OBSESSED with SHINee now. I have been away from Kpop for a little while and suddenly SHINee was on my recommended list from Youtube. I am watching all they're video's now. I missed a lot. Last time I checked I was watching Hello Baby and they're latest MV was Hello. Suddenly Taemin is solo being hot AF and all these new amazing videos are out. WTH I am catching up tonight. Guess I ain't sleeping anytime soon. They're video's are always soo good with the styling and dancing. But OMG have I been missing out! <3,6,2017-12-09T18:59:10Z

@duru_mii,SHAWOLS PLEASE HELP!! there's a group of antis who made several accounts and are spamming Jonghyun's She Is and Lonely mvs with negative comments. a lot of them keep calling him a flop and comparing him to Taemin which is ridiculous bc any true shawol would equally love and support the members instead of pitting them against each other. please help spread love and positivity in Jonghyun's mv comment sections!! and report the trolls too!!,18,2017-12-08T20:32:31Z

Keyword is ""before"" BUT for me until now SHINee is one of the best groups out there, it's just that sadly new kpop fans sleep on them, don't appreciate their talents and such :( SHINee DESERVES THE LOVE AND RECOGNITION THEY GOT BEFORE AGAIN.

@halogen5076,"For the interested : this music genre is called New Jack Swing. This is a fusion between hip hop music, funk and R&B. Famous timeless artists would be Michael and Janet Jackson,  Teddy Riley, SWV, Ralph Tresvant, TLC, Jade, Bobby Brown, Keith Sweet and it goes on...
However, New Jack Swing has a very little audience nowadays so you won't find a lot of artists out there. Fortunately, some of them are still part of the industry and have an incredible amount of talent. Just take a look at Bell Biv DeVoe's last album and Bruno Mars's ""24K Magic"" album, you won't be disappointed. :)

Oh by the way, I'm really glad I found this song. It really stands out from the tons of generic kpop songs we have at the moment. I hope they'll shine brighter in a near future!",22,2017-08-21T00:58:39Z

And in contrary to other groups who have lost members, Shinee is still whole and going strong, so that is a rare achievement that only the best and strongest groups achieve.

@thepridefulones5883,"Hi, I have one thing to say, SHINee is the best, 

Onew, you never fail to impress me with your strange sense of humor and beautiful melodious voice that flows so smoothly, your smile always makes my heart skip a beat and the way that you handle this group of hooligans so ell never ceases to amaze me.

Jonghyun, you always capture my heart with your gorgeous voice that seems like it can hit any note, you sing with such a passion I also really admire you for trying to help the gays in Korea, and you are always going to stay in my heart.
Key, oh god, you truly are the almighty key, you excels at everything, and that fashion sense of yours never stops impressing me, your sassy laid back attitude is absolutely priceless, but I love hen you let your caring side show.

Minho, flaming charisma Minho, Minho dibidibidis, your are something else entirely, from your rapping to your acting you never falter, you never give up, your strong personality and you in general are just something to be admired.

Taemin, Taeminnie, Tae Tae, Taemint, my beautiful, sexy, handsome dancing machine, my god… you always approach everything with a smile on your face, you are extremely determined, you are such a handsome (or as you like to say, sexy) wonderful, kind, young man. When you move I can’t tear my eyes away from the screen, your body moves to the beat in perfect harmony and you shine with the light of billions of stars when you dance. Your voice is also another thing to be admired, you have such a smooth voice, like a stream gently moving along, you sing with such a passion and with such charisma on stage. You are somebody to be admired, I have yet to see a dancer who moves the way that you do and I honestly doubt that ever will be. You have stolen the hearts of millions of fans with the simplest smile. Everything about you, from your strong funny caring personality, to your cutest aeygo. (If you couldn’t tell already he’s my bias)
 
 I am very sad to say goodbye, I have decided to end this life of mine on the early side, I am rather young fan and I don’t want to continue anymore. This is going to sound very selfish but could you try and bring this comment their attention? I want to let them know that they inspired me in the best way possible. Please comment on this and tell them how they inspired you or made your day better!

Honestly though, why are they getting less comebacks and attention from SME just cuz they're a 'senior boy group'. Their ages are pretty much the same as EXO but their career is just gonna stop (kind of) at this age while others at their age are going to just start their career/in their peak??

@sophiek134,"I don't know if anyone is still here, but there's something I need to talk about. If any of you have seen Jonghyuns ""She is"" comment section, you will understand this. In that comment section there seems to be a load of trolls (I hope they are) saying bad things about SHINee and Shawols and even Jonghyun. The way they talk about him is awful. But they also hate on Taemin because he gets more attention from SM. However, they are making a point that Shawols don't care about Jonghyun, however I know we do, but we care for him as SHINees Jonghyun. I've noticed a lack of Shawols on Jonghyuns MVs and I really feel like we need to support his solos more. I've been spending my time trying to defend Shawols to those awful people because I know we all love and appreciate Jonghyun, Shawols are an amazing fandom. But I can't help but notice how few are there. Please Shawols, I ask you, go to Jonghyuns Lonely mv and leave a loving comment. Tell him how much you love and appreciate him. We need to work harder for him because he does so much for us. So I ask of you to show these haters that we Shawols do love Jonghyun. So let's show him lots of support.

@AzulaIsTheBest,I can't believe people think that views matter so much. I don't care if this MV didn't get many views but that doesn't mean SHINee isn't famous anymore. PSY has the most watched video of all time on YouTube but does that mean he's better than artists like Michael Jackson whose song Billie Jean has around 400M on YouTube? It's the influence that matters the most. SHINee is one of the main groups that spread Kpop around the world. Back when even 20M was a lot for a Kpop song they got a lot of views. Even if this song didn't get a lot of views their album sales are still pretty good and they're highly successful in Asia. Remember that YouTube isn't the main streaming website in every country. For example in China YouTube is banned. If YouTube was available in China I'm pretty sure many Kpop and pop music videos would have been watched more. Nowadays I see many Kpop fans(especially Armies) trying to increase the views of their favourite Kpop group and act as if they're the best Kpop group ever. I'm not offending anyone but I'm just so sick of these so called 'Kpop fans' who think views matter the most and push other groups behind. Ps. I mean some armies. I love BTS too but I've gotten sick of the fandom. Not every Army is like this but there are many who give a bad name to the fandom.,29,2017-04-17T21:20:27Z

@xBubblex1,"I am glad that they tried  this kind of music. It's one of the reasons that proves SHINee is very different and on another level among the current kpop groups.  Nowadays, most of kpop groups tend to release their music with current music trend which warrants them that their music will be loved by fans immediately.... however, those kind of musics will also fast forget when another new one comes out. This throwback music by SHINee is so pleasant to listen and I don't think I will get tired of it easily^^ .... and another good point I think most fans can easily sing this song along with the boys .... imagine the whole concert venue is pumping up by the boys and Shawols together with this song❤️ how cool^^",107,2017-04-08T05:04:58Z

I turn 15 in September// Irrelevant, but I also first listen to kpop when I was like 4 back in 2006 ) I only properly became a shawol in ringdingdong era (i think. it's been so long,maybe it was since their debut?) . Every song and MV is just awesome. Every comeback just as great as the one before. I just love them so much. I still love them just as much as I first stan them even tho I stan like so much more groups (so many of them Rookie grps and those debut like in 2010/2011-2013 (what do you call them idk) but I always love the 2nd gen grps that I stan (which is a lot) more. 1st Gen grps are great but I don't really stan them) now compared to like ringdingdong era.

If you look at songs like ""if it isn't love"" (1988) by New Edition and ""Every little step""(1989) by Bobby Brown, SHINee's song definitely falls under the category of late 80's R&B.

Este proyecto es para que los vídeos: Lucifer que cuenta con 77 M de vista y Ring Ding Dong que cuenta con 74 M de vistas por fin lleguen a los 100 M de vistas.
¿En qué costa el proyectó?
lo único que harás sera reproducir estos dos vídeos todos los días con un mínimo de 5 veces (cada uno), recuerda que tiene que ser intercalados los vídeo ejemplo: lucifer, ring ding dong, lucifer, etc... 
También recuerda en  debes de  borrar el historial de reproducción de youtube y de no reproducir los vídeos en tu cuenta de youtube para que  haya más posibilidad de que cuenten las vistas. También comporte los vídeos para que otras personas los vean y comentarles a los demás shawols de este proyecto para que se enteren y podamos llegar a los 100 M de vistas. 
RECUERDA SHINee CUMPLIRÁ 9 AÑOS EN LA INDUSTRIA DE LA MÚSICA Y DEL K-POP Y SE ESFUERZAN TODOS LOS DÍAS PARA DAR LO MEJOR DE ELLOS, HAY QUE DAR LO MEJOR DE NOSOTROS PARA DEMOSTRARLES QUE SIEMPRE LOS QUEREMOS Y AMAMOS Y QUE MEJORE QUE DARLES DOS VÍDEOS CON 100 M DE VISTAS.",1,2017-01-23T05:30:00Z

@Dztruxtion,ALRIGHT SHAWOLS ITS TIME TO GET TO VOTING! Okay so we're VERY ahead on the inkisang for SMA so we've shifted to voting for the main award! YES WE ARE GETTING THE MOVE ON WE WANT THEM TO PROGRESS SOMEWHAT! I think this is a great thing spread the news anyone who sees this and make sure you find a way to vote. You can get the app or go online they have fast charge for free coins and you get about 30 coins per video and there's no limit in the amount of coins you get. 100 tokens gives you 1 ticket keep that in mind 500 tokens gives you 5 tickets and you can vote unlimited times so we can do 100 votes alone 😬 even if we don't reach the goal in any way we might as well try to aim for something they've been winning the popularity award for about 3 years in a row and so it's a dead giveaway that we're in the lead now with a huge gap this time again. So yea LETS TRY OUR BEST AS THE GREAT SHAWOLS WE ARE!  (You're going to see my comment everywhere),2,2017-01-11T22:18:07Z

@jwyz26,"Aren't they literally the best kpop boy group out there today? It's understandable that they aren't as popular as they used to be back when kpop wasn't all overused boring American pop music and new groups with literally the same old concepts. Shinee have always been so original and yes that's a factor as to why they're not as big in the industry as they used to be. I mean they are still REALLY big but just not as talked about which is basically what happens to all senior groups unless you're a group like Big Bang where even after 10 years everyone loves you the same. I mean yeah shinee don't get too good promotions and even though shawols is a hUGE fan base its just that most of us are older and less active fans. Probably older kpop fans who've stanned them since debut but are now in Uni or have jobs? I mean personally no I'm still a teen in high school and only properly stanned them this year after years of my sister showing me vids of them but me not giving a shit and saying they looked like girls (¿?) bc I was a strange tween???? Shinee are pretty rich, successful and known and have a fan base that adore the shit out of them so what more could they want? They're humble, down to earth and talented men and I really hope we get to see more of them. It's sad that the industry doesn't talk about originality in groups like shinee as much as the same old boring overused group concepts. Oh well. That's modern pop for us.",1104,2016-12-28T22:52:35Z

Granted, I've stopped identifying as a Shawol years ago, but that didn't stop me from regularly checking their comebacks and following Taemin's wonderful solo. Why did I then only find out about this comeback from Seventeen's cover of this performed today at Music Bank? The views are also low for one of the more popular 2nd generation (I think) kpop groups. Are they declining in fame? Same is happening for TMWTD, the views are too low for them. This is one of SHINee's more stylish works.

#OnHoSelcaDay 
Celebrating both Onew and Minho’s birthday we want to have fun and celebrate our beloved guys. On the weekend of December 10-11 take a selca using elements that may identify both SHINee members. 
Example: 
*Soccer ball and chicken
*White coat (for their dramas as doctors) And more!
Just upload it on your social media sites with the hashtag #OnHoSelcaDay and say shortly your message for their birthday. December it’s a HUGE month due to the double birthday so let’s go!! Please Share this everywhere.

@annplifybanana6381,"Not sure if anyone notices this but one of m favorite things about this video is the women used in it. If you notice, they mostly have monolids (epicanthal folds), structured faces, plumper lips, etc. instead of the typical v-shaped/egg shaped face, large eyed, feminine chin, small lips, etc look thats constantly seen in K-POP.

Idk its just nice to see another type of beauty being celebrated in K-Pop especially considering the beauty standards.",2,2016-12-06T22:08:31Z

@anumnazahah5508,"I had to stop everything I was doing to write this comment. (Anyways, I am not gonna comment abt the visuals bcs the MV director really wants us to appreciate the sound and also bcs the visual & dancing is a+). okay here we go:
1. This is such a perfect song. Listen to how it was structured. kudos to the composer and also the lyricist. the song came off as 'light' but I am absolutely sure they put really careful thoughts into every beats and sound.
2. The lines are fairly distributed, each member serves their purpose.
3. I was listening to this song in highest quality on spotify and noticed the harmonies and adlibs and they are incredible (pay attention to the vocal layers). The sense they put in singing each lines worth every compliments.
4. This song is the most-shinee song ever even though it isnt as bold as Married to The Music (which was an absolute masterpiece).
5. I hope that shinee will continue making music bcs they are serious in putting out good music.

I hope that everyone involved in making this song receives the compliments they deserve. 수고하셨습니다.",21,2016-12-06T07:12:29Z

Their artists are not properly advertised! I cannot feel SM anymore! I have been in SMTOWN since 2009 (before college) but I only feel JYP this year. 
Is it because SM is only promoting EXO?
Is it because SM hasn't moved on from Jessica, Tao, Kris, and Luhan's departure?
WTH is really wrong with SM?
If I didn't watch Happy Together, I won't even know that SHINEE's back (back back).

@MsHistoryLover,cute how people in the comments section are calling shinee has-beens//flops when they won the prime minister award recently and is one of the most respected groups with complete members despite being in the industry for almost 9 years now. Let's not ignore the fact that they have also been mentioned by (big) international magazines for their artistry. All the members are also well-known and are NAILING their individual activities. don't stoop so low by comparing your faves with SHINee. If y'all wanna brag go talk about your faves under their videos thanks,863,2016-11-03T04:11:42Z

@kachan1457,"Honestly when I think of 1of1 Im really proud, but then when I go to youtube I just get sad, not because of the views but because of all the people talking about it. It's like we've become so used to ""if the view count is low, they're unpopular"" like NO. I LOVE SHINEE, and in korea they are doing AMAZING, bare in mind that they promoted with BTS, which is like a group with a major fanbase. SHINee has been in the industry for 8years now, so of course they arent THAT popular anymore, but they are still doing REALLY well, despote the fact that SM BARELY promotes them, AND THAT THEY PARTICIPATE IN COMPOSING AND WRITING LYRICS.
Like which other group, that has a major fanbase, does this? Most of them get the hit songs, learn the choreo and lyrics, get awesome promotion and BAM, 40M views. SHINee is different, but I can apreciate that, because for me it doesn't matter. I dont look at the views, I read the comments and I want to see how my babys are being praised by fans, but instead I see everyone sad because of the views..",2,2016-11-03T00:14:49Z

@CaithlinPena,"Dear Shawols, you've probably all noticed the amount of trolls picking on our boys and on our fandom as well. Don't retaliate, don't feed them, and just ignore them. We're known as one of K-pop's most peaceful fandom, and we don't want to ruin that name, because what we do reflects on SHINee. What these trolls do reflects on their idols as well and we don't want to stoop down to their level. 
In the words of our Diva Key, he's not aiming to be the best, but to be someone he's not ashamed to be. SHINee is not ashamed of who they are and their style, so why should the haters' words affect us? 
We know SHINee, they are legendary, talented, and ambassadors of Hallyu. Not once in the last 8 years have they asked Shawols to help them win awards, but simply to enjoy their music, so let's do exactly that, for SHINee and for our SHINee World. <3",236,2016-11-01T18:48:31Z

I'm baffled by this view count. This deserves more attention and I really hope its doing well on the charts. I've known about SHINee for some time now but I have honestly never really kept track of their activities/music (I have watched one episode of them on weekly idol tho & Jonghyun is gorgeous) My mind is already telling me I have a bias in the group, but 90% of that is because I think he is sexy af (Jonghyun). So can someone tell me if SHINee was formed through a competition (like Who's Next & No.Mercy?) and if yes can you tell me where I can watch it? + tell me some other programs with them to watch in order? I really want to get to know more about this group and their personalities.

@roxannemarie3628,"I wasn't paying much attention to SHINee with the whole NCT, EXO, & BTS stuff going on but this song is so bomb and just makes me feel proud that SHINee was one of my first 3 ever Kpop groups. And after all these years with them, I'm still not surprised that I still can't pick a bias. I used to think it was Taemin, but then Jonghyun wrecked that. Then I though it was Jh, but Onew wrecked that. And When I finally settled for Onew, here comes Minho FINER THAN EVER..... WTF.",53,2016-10-31T08:59:47Z

The concepts are always different but I like it. I love you SHINee and I'm proud that I became your fan ❤

@Wind123move,"Seriously tired of fans complaining that Youtube is blocking their faves views from increasing.

 

Like Youtube cares about blocking some k-pop group. They're just doing their job auditing the views to avoid frauds. That's why the views don't increase as fast as you impatient people would like.

 

If your faves views are low it's because people simply don't care about them as much as you think.",3,2016-10-24T13:01:29Z

@erikatakeru90,"SHINee is entering their 9th year & I've been a Shawol long enough from a teen fangirl and now a fully employed lady. I'm pretty sure a lot of Shawols are around my age (*same age as Jong Hyun). SHINee will always be the 1st group that brought me to kpop in 2009. Some may say SHINee in need of 'normal concept' for once to garner more fans. I say not. I love the boys for who they are. Frankly speaking this concept looks perfectly normal because it is SHINee. Only SHINee can pull this of. They've proven everything they can do and still are slaying it. SHINee World concert tickets sold out every single time. To top that, these boys have been on SHINee World Tours for atleast 9 times not including SMTOWN Tours. 

To all Shawols, cheers! Our boys are legend and a veteran in kpop. 

p/s: Keep going with the views. I dont have time to watch, so i just let it runs on my pc with earphone plugged in.",78,2016-10-24T08:31:54Z

guys, yesterday i contacted the YouTube customer care forum to ask or rather complain about the frozen views. I later got a reply saying that YouTube recently updated their method of counting the views. read this . These are the contents of the message:
""This is absolutely normal as YouTube audits views on every video uploaded. This will cause your views to freeze and often times, decrease as YouTube discards low quality views. Low quality views include : visitors who see your video for only a couple of seconds and then leave . View counts will usually normalize after a couple of days (after upload).""

@diddle1675,"you guys, Sometimes the views dont mean shit.  You know how popular they are in korea?!  How many show champions have they won with this song? 3?  Same with F(x), and i could name so many other groups.  Shinee always has had low view counts compared to other newer groups.  All that matters to me is every single time shinee comes out with an album, Its always the best album of the year for me, EVERY SINGLE TIME.  Shinee was my first kpop group i loved with sherlock, and ever since, theyve been killing it",8,2016-10-19T17:13:56Z

@YuKaKariyu,"Guys, I agree that the view count is weird - but remember that a lot of other groups also just came back. A lot of Shawols that I know personally are streaming BTS's new MV over SHINee's simply b/c BTS is a newer group. Let me explain, SHINee's an older group so their fanbase has mellowed out, that is all the seasonal fans have left and all of the diehard Shawols are here to stay. BTS on the other hand is still a very young group, and still hasn't experienced that mellowing of the fanbase (EXO seems to be going through it right now). Taking all that together, a lot of my friends who are Shawols and Armys have opted to stream BTS's MV b/c they aren't worried about SHINee, they had confidence that SHINee would win so they chose to help a newer group that is still growing. Either way though...  #SaveSHINeeViewCount",50,2016-10-16T18:24:11Z

But guys, seriously, how many SM groups are allowed to compose their own songs and albums? How many SM artists are allowed to release a solo album that all composed himself? How many SM artists can make their voice heard to direct their own concerts' costumes? SHINEE MAY BE THE ONLY EXCEPTION. Our kids are actually given privilege by SM because THEY CAN DO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO.
And, the most important thing is, they are together and they're happy with the now.

@nikkajay9823,"This is really creative to go back to the 80's style with the fashion, dance, and music sound. There's a special blend in the sound that makes it modern to this era style of pop music, and I'm like glued to the sound! 🤓 To everyone who worked hard on the music, dance, and fashion visual/music video - you've all done a great job!
To SHINee: Despite Onew not dancing most of the time in this video, I think this might be another great hit.

Tip for the future: If someone in the group is not able to dance in the video, you can balance that out by having that person be somewhat of a main focus, so that the person doesn't feel left out from 50% of the video covering dance shots.",2,2016-10-16T03:31:32Z

@symckr,"Im an army, i came here to listen the song bcs its good but all i see is 'stolen' shinee's views and bts. first stop lying to yourselfs. there is nothing wrong with the views. even it froze/stuck youtube uploads the views after that. that site looks for the clicks, youtube looks for the views. also stop with this army/bts thing. why bts' views bothers you? when i think it with you guys' logic, arent you downgrading shinee with naming them along with bts?
well, i gave you guys one view. have a nice day 😥 also next time try harder for their comeback and dont blame it on another things.",0,2016-10-15T15:35:36Z

@unknownknown2078,"Okay I don't know where to start.. There are TOO MUCH views who are missing and I think YouTube clearly doesn't give a single fuck. I saw a lot of shawols complaining on Twitter by mentioning YouTube but I don't know what they are waiting for to give us the views. Maybe they don't like when people tell them when there are views who are missing so they fuck up even more the counter? anyways, if it's the reason, it's disrespectful af and i'm not even biased since i stan many groups but i never saw a kpop group with views so fucked up. I never watch MVs on Tudou (idk if i wrote it well) but I really want to stop watching the MV here and go on this site because their MV has more than 9M on this site. The only problem is that they need Youtube's views to win on music shows right? ----> BY THE WAY, don't find excuses for YouTube by saying there are views who are deleted because some fans use a logiciel to replay the video for more views: everyone understood we shouldn't use this type of things since last week + every groups have stans who use this type of things, why SHINee should have this amount of views who are deleted",1,2016-10-14T14:05:42Z

I have loved the group for years, I really hope they can thrive and thrive. There are not many years left till they have to join military. I really hope we can have more of them before they join military. Of course we will all support them after they come back from the military. But who knows about chances you will still give them and how many new groups will be generated. I treasure the group very much. Their songs got me through many sad moments in my life and THEY ARE GOOD.

We need to try our best for our boys, even if it means watching this the old school way and closing out of the tab, searching for the video, and letting it play- every single time. The gap is insane, the view count is insane. I know it is hard not to believe all of this is the result of some rigging/injustice/or something, but the best we can do is just /continue/ supporting! Here's the link: http://mwave.interest.me/mcountdown/vote/preVote

P.S: Also don't want to freak anyone out, and SHINee did just say a few days ago that this was unlikely to happen...but we have to remember that our boys are now a senior group. What happened to other senior groups when they didn't do all that great in their comebacks? They disband (can't help but think and cry about 4minute...). So please, even if all of this may just be an unnecessary fear: I'd rather sleep better at night knowing I'm helping keeping our boys afloat and continue being one of the best groups in the kpop industry, then letting them flop and regretting everything I could have done better if bad news roll around..",1,2016-10-14T11:34:52Z

The only 3 in SHINee who has ever looked good in med light to very light hair are Key, Garmin and Jonghyun. Ones can go Dark to med-light but Minho he needs to stay black to browns.

@sydneylai5592,"I would only be satisfied if they won Artist of the Year during award season and here's why:
1. Taemin's solo comeback was freaking awesome and shook Earth, plus he proved his dominance on Hit the Stage
2. Descendants of the Sun was a huge turning point for the kdrama industry and Onew was highly praised for his work in it
3. Jonghyun's She Is album is pure genius, and perfectly highlights his talent as a writer, producer, composer, singer, dancer, and       overall performer, plus Blue Night
4. Minho has been gaining recognition as a respectable actor and his film was (or is going to be?) in freaking Cannes Film Festival
5. Key has been designing so much of their concert and comeback concepts, and we all saw the outfits during their Japan concerts this year, they were actually life-changing, plus acting in Drinking Solo
6. Their Japan concerts and ridiculously successful Tokyo Dome concerts

So overall they've contributed so much not only to the music industry but to global entertainment as a whole, they've proved once again that they are so much more than just idols, and they've rounded out the year by being perfect and bringing back OT5 in a comeback with a concept that is in the opposite direction of what every other group is doing right now. And all in just one year.  Stan kings.",12,2016-10-13T02:48:48Z

@masadidisu,"I've been a fan of SHINee since 2010. I see all the changes from debut until now. The views of every SHINee's mv is not really high compared to other famous kpop groups except for RDD, hello, lucifer.... We know that SHINee has high popularity and reputation. This makes me confuse why not their mv views. Well, SHINee doesn't produce much brainwashing songs but pieces of art. They are who they are. I love the way they choose their songs and styles for every comebacks. I know the views are important for them to get the awards but i hope all shawols can take it easy. It's NOT because of their popularity decreases. Real fans know that they are always shining as usual. I know everyone is trying hard to stream the mv, me either. Let's make this comment section more positive okay? I'm sorry if you were offended by what I said.

@peachyjaehyunie9463,"i would like to rant here:

remember that shinee is a contemporary band, their target isnt the majority population of kpop fans. they have their own unique style that doesn't follow on what's in the trend. they make their own way. they make music not for an award but because of theyre truly artists who believe in their own passion, not what the public demands.
the other groups can get a goddamn amount of 9999 million views for their mv for all i care or even receive daesang every year for all i care. but for me, there's just one and only group that shines in my heart (i know this is so cheesy but this is coming from the bottom of my heart).
and in the end, what matters is they are happy and still as solid as a rock in the form of 5HINee. SHINee and SHINee WORLD will continue to form as a solid family and we will support them no matter what ❤✨",12,2016-10-11T11:05:12Z

@TaNdy88tJiSmE,"Let me do a full review and state my case. When I first listened to this song, I was thinking ""how would Shawol react to such a different genre of music?"" From 'Misconception of Us' to 'Odd' or 'Married to the music', their music was progressing through a bit of bluesy, deep house, electro pop kind of sound. Then jumping to something like this which is vocal dominant track with syth background. This would really test the fans. And what a test it has been.

Many were debating why this music video has so few views? Why are we struggling to support them with their award winnings? There are many reasons. One could simply be the fact that this track is not one of those where you would immediately like it. Secondly, it is such a huge deviation from their usual sound that some Shawol may find it hard to fall in love with. As for me, '1 of 1' is simply not my favourite track in this album. This is my own opinion, not to say it is true. 

SHINee's musicality is undoubtedly one of the best. Their harmonies and backing vocals are all throughout this music video. Unless if you have some music background or have some form of vocal training, one may find it hard to appreciate the talent behind this music. The background music is kept simple and the same throughout this track. It is SHINee's vocals the brought colour to the track. If you really listen to it, and imagine their vocal tracks being cancelled and listen to only the background music, you will hear a mono toned music with an occasional guitar solo. Without their harmonies and vocals, this would be a very dull song.

Basically, this track or for the matter of fact, this album require multiple listening. Hwaiting!!!",1,2016-10-11T10:13:00Z

fanwar is an immature way. just focus on what we love. support them and respect them.

i am a shawol, but i respect big bang and all senior group that debut before SHINee. and i do respect exo, bts and etc that debut after SHINee. even tho i didn't like some type of music on some group, but i still respect them.

@sanah1968,views shouldnt even matter much seriously. just enjoy their music. no matter how much views they get they are STILL one of the most successful groups in kpop without a doubt. dont pay attention to the views and the negative bullshit that comes from others. All that matters is that shawols continue to always support them. dont pay attention to how many views other groups are getting or what other fandoms are saying just love and support your fav group ignore the negative. 😊 SUJU and shinee are the only groups i like. i dont care what others say about them because they're both legends till this day so it dosnt affect me.,41,2016-10-10T22:48:21Z

@siyiwinniethepooh,"Some methods could be done to increase youtube views (not absolutely sure but better than nothing):
1. Watch the MV till the end, do not skip advertisements
2. Watch at quality at least 720p
3. Use incognito mode
4. Watch another video (eg. 1 of 1 live performances, other SHINee MVs) before watching this again
5. Use different devices (tablets, phones, computers) because multiple devices from same IP could mean multiple views
6. If you use chrome, open an incognito window, press F12, select a different device using the tab at the top, go to youtube and watch this MV, then close the window and repeat again
Perhaps we are just using the wrong method so the views are so low......Add oil and don't give up!!!",4,2016-10-10T04:38:30Z

@supernamu69,Shawols what you are experiencing now about the views we also experienced that in the infinite views. Infinite the eye mv is already in 5M when we start experiencing a hard time rising up the views to reach 6M and sometimes Youtube freezed our views. While that group (I will not mention the name because I respect that group and I dont like fanwars) who have just realeased their mv just few days is already almost in 5M and us(Inspirits) was still suffering to reach the 6M. We are already wondering why the views of The eye are rising so low because some inspirits including me are non stop streaming from morning to evening and sometomes some inspirits sleeping 2am. But the views seems like not moving while the views of that other group are rising up so fast. Maybe they have just more fans than Infinite or Youtube being a biased now too like___ haha. I realized now maybe fans more like the newer one than the older one(Did you get what I mean?) Shawols Do all your best to get the Shinee's first win and prove it that older kpop can still win and Shinee are not underrated as some people say like what they said to Infinite. Aja!!!

@erinmckiblet6225,"Definitely not their BEST MV, but I can tell that they're always putting their best effort. I think the music style is different , which is good, but I don't think it's exactly the right style for them. I've heard them say in interviews that they want to experiment with different styles of music. But I will still continue to support them no matter what. And just to make it clear (so I won't get any haters ) , SHINee's talent hasn't worsened , it's just that the style of music didn't seem right to me.

Amd others could get 10m views in 1 week but SHINee isn't. Idk if there's something wrong abt SHINee's viewers in youtube. But I know that Shawols keep tryin' hard to stream the MV. SHINee's album's sale was good. And every tickets concerts was sold out in just 2 minutes. Idk why SHINee never really good in YouTube viewers. The viewers keep frozen. It has been three times? Or more? I hope I could do better for them, but it's ok, I've tryin' hard x'D Shawols let's support SHINee everytime, every second in our life ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ",9,2016-10-07T01:46:23Z

They are all visuals. They can all sing (I will fight everyone who say that Minho can't sing). They can all dance. They can all act. They are all such a sweet people.
I love that even tho Shinee is contemporary group, you can still always regocnize them through their music. You immediately know that this is Shinee's song.

I know that SM might be a shitty company, but I want to thank them for bringing these beautiful people together and making me smile just only for listening their music.",1,2016-10-06T20:41:49Z

@jeonghantrash5736,"I saw some upset kpop stans👀

Omg people need to chill. Stop calling them ""overrated"" or ""old"". If you were EVER a true kpop stan, you'd know SuJu, BigBang and so many other groups that have been LEGENDS for YEARS. This is a new concept for SHINee and they are always going to be legends.

Stop calling EXO and all the other groups ""kings"", because they are kings in someone's eyes. All Korean groups are amazingly talented. Can you immature children go one day without comparing a group?

You don't like a group? OHHMYGOD, congrats. Keep it to yourself. It's upsetting how many butthurt stans I see down in the comments.

And about their concept, it is 90's and very pre-2000's. It's not supposed to be modern or ""typical"". It's different. Although it's not for everyone, just appreciate the music and you don't have to listen if you don't want to. Nobody is forcing you to comment or listen to ANYTHING. You come here of your own volition, expect some backlash.",1,2016-10-06T02:12:55Z

@Orpheelover,"I think what I like most about this album his how involved all of SHINee is. Like Jonghyun wrote the music of 'prism' and he, Minho and Key wrote lyrics of 'don't stop'. Minho and Key also helped with the lyrics of 'don't let me go'. Minho helped with the lyrics of 'lipstick' and 'you need me'. Onew wrote the lyrics of 'so amazing'. Taemin mentioned he worked together with the choreographer of 1of1. Like in which other group do you find the members so involved in a album? And from SM of all compagnies. And it's probably one of the best albums they did (judging that they already broke their highest sales record for day 1 by 11K).

this music video is not a boring and cheap music video production, that's just the freaking concept, it's the 90's concept. 
Do you know any 90''s music video having high quality and extraordinary things? It was mostly about the 90's style and simpliness. So, if you don't understand and appreciate the concept of this music video,just kindly fuck off and leave the comment's section before you infect it.

@SeraphimDreamer,"Even after 5 years of loving SHINee, I still feel the same craze whenever they have a comeback. I'm always so proud to tell everyone that no matter how many groups I go crazy for, the ones that's always in my heart is always SHINee since the moment they got me into Korean pop music. I always feel so damn happy to be a shawol, to be a part of this loving family. As much as I love SHINee, I also respect them just as much and they honestly inspire me so much with the amount of hard work they always put into everything they do. To all my fellow loving shawols, let's all continue to work hard to show our love for SHINee no matter how many times the views freeze! To everyone new, SHINee is honestly such a wonderful band and you will not regret ever joining this fandom, it's always better late than never so don't be too worried over joining the fandom this late in the game! Let's all do our best and show them our love and loyalty! (Though I won't mind Onew putting me in the prison of his smile and feeding me tofu.)",4,2016-10-05T13:20:44Z

@emilylam7611,"SHINee – 1 of 1 
하루 중에 1분 1초 다르듯
날마다 넌 새로워져
하나 중에 그중에
제일 첫 번째
유일하단 뜻인 거야 너
나를 부르는 네 목소리
사뿐하게 다가와서
내 귓가에 미끄러져
손에 감겨오는 네 손길이
처음 만나는 저 눈부신
세상으로 나를 이끌어
넌 1 of 1 girl
오직 하나
틀림없이 나의 답인 너
넌 1 of 1 girl
완벽해
비교할 수 없는 넌 이미
내 세상의 유일한 의미
하나의 이름 너라는 사람에
꼭 들어맞는 컬러를 입힌 듯 Yeah
귓가에 스친 달콤한 노래처럼
완벽하게 어울려
자꾸 너를 부르게 돼
처음의 그 느낌처럼 언제나 Replay
Replay
네 사랑은 새롭게 빛나
난 또다시 Fallin’ fallin’ for you
사랑한다는 말도 네겐 지겹지 않아
달콤한 입맞춤
서로에게만 맞춘 발걸음
아무 예고 없이 두 눈이 마주친
너는 왜 이리 아름다운지
Let’s go You’re my baby
넌 1 of 1 girl
오직 하나
틀림없이 나의 답인 너
넌 1 of 1 girl
완벽해
비교할 수 없는 넌 이미
내 세상의 유일한 의미
1 of 1 girl
오직 하나
빈틈없이 나를 채우지
넌 1 of 1 girl
완벽해
대신할 수 없는 넌 오직
내 세상의 유일한 의미
이토록 깊이 너에게
스며 변하고 있어
널 닮은 빛으로 밝힌 맘이
가득 차오를 때
내가 너를 비춰 줄게
넌 1 of 1 girl
오직 하나
틀림없이 나의 답인 너
넌 1 of 1 girl
완벽해
비교할 수 없는 넌 이미
내 세상의 유일한 의미
1 of 1 girl
오직 하나
빈틈없이 나를 채우지
넌 1 of 1 girl

@현이-l9k,"하루 중에 1분 1초 다르듯
날마다 넌 새로워져
하나 중에 그중에 제일 첫 번째
유일하단 뜻인 거야 너

나를 부르는 네 목소리
사뿐하게 다가와서 내 귓가에 미끄러져
손에 감겨오는 네 손길이
처음 만나는 저 눈부신 세상으로 나를 이끌어

넌 ‘1 of 1’ girl
오직 하나
틀림없이 나의 답인 너
넌 ‘1 of 1’ girl
완벽해
비교할 수 없는 넌 이미
내 세상의 유일한 의미

하나의 이름 너라는 사람에
꼭 들어맞는 컬러를 입힌 듯 Yeah
귓가에 스친 달콤한 노래처럼
완벽하게 어울려 자꾸 너를 부르게 돼

처음의 그 느낌처럼 언제나 Replay (Replay)
네 사랑은 새롭게 빛나
난 또다시 Fallin’ fallin’ for you (Come here)
사랑한다는 말도 네겐 지겹지 않아

달콤한 입맞춤
서로에게만 맞춘 발걸음
아무 예고 없이 두 눈이 마주친
너는 왜 이리 아름다운지
(Let’s go) You’re my baby

넌 ‘1 of 1’ girl
오직 하나
틀림없이 나의 답인 너
넌 ‘1 of 1’ girl
완벽해
비교할 수 없는 넌 이미
내 세상의 유일한 의미

‘1 of 1’ girl
오직 하나
빈틈없이 나를 채우지
넌 ‘1 of 1’ girl
완벽해
대신할 수 없는 넌 오직
내 세상의 유일한 의미

이토록 깊이 너에게 스며 변하고 있어
널 닮은 빛으로 밝힌 맘이 가득 차오를 때
내가 너를 비춰 줄게

넌 ‘1 of 1’ girl
오직 하나
틀림없이 나의 답인 너
넌 ‘1 of 1’ girl
완벽해
비교할 수 없는 넌 이미
내 세상의 유일한 의미

1 of 1’ girl
오직 하나
빈틈없이 나를 채우지
넌 ‘1 of 1’ girl
완벽해
대신할 수 없는 넌 오직
내 세상의 유일한 의미

넌 ‘1 of 1’ girl
넌 ‘1 of 1’ girl
틀림없이 나의 답인 너
넌 ‘1 of 1’ girl
(‘1 of 1’ girl ‘1 of 1’)
비교할 수 없어 누구도

@shinee_love7582,"1. Open browser.  Does not have to be in Incognito Mode, but makes things easier.
2.  You can be logged in to Youtube or not.  It does not matter.
3.  Watch  music video.  You can search for it or use a bookmark.  Either way works.  You can watch it in any video quality.  240, 360, 480, 1080, It all works. after watching it, instead of replay or refresh, close the tab and search the mv again.
4.  After watching the whole video - this is the key:  Wait at least 4 minutes before watching it again.  If you wait 5 minutes, your chances of getting your view counted increases.  If you wait less than 4 minutes before watching the MV again, your chances of getting your view counted decreases.  It may get counted, but not likely.
5.  While waiting, you can watch another video, but it is not required; just waiting.  Watching another video like will make waiting easier and more accurate.
6.  After 10 views  clear your browser cache and cookies.  Start again.

They managed to entrance me when I was 14 years old and now that I'm 20, I'm still here fangirling like my 14 year old self. Plus the fandom is one of the best!

I think Feel Good or Prism but I'm a HUGE Shawol so anythinh they do i will love. I love the album just too many women lol,2,2016-10-05T02:04:38Z

@ParkBomming,"I'm so.. proud. LOL. I love it so much when SHINee has an ""old school"" sound in their music. I remember when the Dream Girl album came out and had ""Punch Drunk Love"" like a 70s feel to it. And now they brought 90s back and I know not many people appreciate that sound anymore, but I'm one of the few that does. I think SM likes to have SHINee do this kind of throwback style a lot, and that's why I think SHINee will always be my favorite SM artist. I wonder what an Onew, Key, and Minho mini album would bring tbh. I know Jonghyun really likes bass in his R&B music, and Taemin has various genres in his music, but I wonder what kind of music Onew, Key, and Minho likes. Idk, but I'm sort of ready to hear something from Onew (aka mini album/full album.)

GUYS, MY #1 GROUP SHINEE'S BACK!! My sister is gonna freak when I tell her I liked it; her bias is Jonghyun and he looks amazing with that blue suit and the red turtle neck underneath. I found this kinda funny, I just realized, seeing it again, at 3:09 Taemin's wearing a yellow suit and a blue turtle neck, Jonghyun's wearing a blue suit and a red turtle neck, Onew's wearing a red suit and a brown shirt and Key is wearing a brown suit. Then there's Minho, with that pinstripe suit and the red button up and the gray-ish blonde hair, lookin like a pimp XD. But Taemin and Onew look like a ketchup and mustard bottle lmao.

Then high school happened, and I kinda forgot about the whole k-pop world. However, this randomly popped out on my home page, and i'm so glad it did.
I'm remembering all those fangirl feels right now, I still love these 5 boys just like I used to. My shawol spirit is still there & it hasn't changed a single bit. I'm definitely coming back to support them in their comeback❤️

날마다 넌 새로워져
하나 중에 그중에 제일 첫 번째
유일하단 뜻인 거야 너

나를 부르는 네 목소리
사뿐하게 다가와서 내 귓가에 미끄러져
손에 감겨오는 네 손길이
처음 만나는 저 눈부신 세상으로 나를 이끌어

넌 ‘1 of 1’ girl
오직 하나
틀림없이 나의 답인 너
넌 ‘1 of 1’ girl
완벽해
비교할 수 없는 넌 이미
내 세상의 유일한 의미

하나의 이름 너라는 사람에
꼭 들어맞는 컬러를 입힌 듯 Yeah
귓가에 스친 달콤한 노래처럼
완벽하게 어울려 자꾸 너를 부르게 돼

처음의 그 느낌처럼 언제나 Replay (Replay)
네 사랑은 새롭게 빛나
난 또다시 Fallin’ fallin’ for you (Come here)
사랑한다는 말도 네겐 지겹지 않아

달콤한 입맞춤
서로에게만 맞춘 발걸음
아무 예고 없이 두 눈이 마주친
너는 왜 이리 아름다운지
(Let’s go) You’re my baby

넌 ‘1 of 1’ girl
오직 하나
틀림없이 나의 답인 너
넌 ‘1 of 1’ girl
완벽해
비교할 수 없는 넌 이미
내 세상의 유일한 의미

‘1 of 1’ girl
오직 하나
빈틈없이 나를 채우지
넌 ‘1 of 1’ girl
완벽해
대신할 수 없는 넌 오직
내 세상의 유일한 의미

이토록 깊이 너에게 스며 변하고 있어
널 닮은 빛으로 밝힌 맘이 가득 차오를 때
내가 너를 비춰 줄게

넌 ‘1 of 1’ girl
오직 하나
틀림없이 나의 답인 너
넌 ‘1 of 1’ girl
완벽해
비교할 수 없는 넌 이미
내 세상의 유일한 의미

Just 'cause it might be seen as ""tacky"" by this generations' quite boring & bland sense of style doesn't mean it's bad! Maybe they can be the boy group version of Wonder Girls, doing only extremely stylized throwbacks to old eras! I think this concept has been fitting them so well, since early 2015!

@pa_ec,"To those who are wondering why the set/backdrop is bare/plain/""cheap"", well, SHINee's concept is the 90's & there are several MVs in that decade that look similar to this one. :)

On another note, SHINee is a contemporary band so do not expect them to stick to one concept only.",265,2016-10-04T21:51:35Z

@OddWeird461,"After reading the comments I have to assume that very few of the supposed SHINee fans actually paid attention to anything about this comeback until the MV was released.  It's a 90s throwback concept.  Everything about it is related to the 90s or 80s, including the simple music video and the white background, their clothing, etc.  

If you have issues with any of it, take it up with Key, who I'm sure did all the clothing concepts and maybe even the mv, because he's supposedly now one of SM's art directors.  Take it up with all of them, because they all had something to do w/ the album. 

I actually love it, because I'm older than most of you. I'm also open to new things as well.  SHINee already did EDM, the 70s, trap, electronica, etc. I love that SHINee is willing to experiment and do new things.  I'm sure I'll see other kpop groups copying this concept pretty soon, and when I do, I'll be sure not to go to their videos and complain about how boring they are, since I'll understand wtf is going on.

Edit to add- Going back to my earlier statement about not paying attention: ONEW HURT HIS ANKLE DURING THEIR LAST CONCERTS. That's why he's sitting in the mv. He's better now.",727,2016-10-04T21:50:59Z

@ethomson62,"Dunno why everyone is judging whether it's the MV or the song but at least their trying, I may not like this song much now but I'll give it a few more listens and I'll probably love it! It's simply a new concept, every artist does this! EXO's Lotto was nearly entirely different from EXO's usual style, if they can try something new why can't SHINee? SHINee are kings they have some amazing songs and dances out there, plus each of them have their individual solo activities whether it be acting, singing or even variety shows! Experimenting is included in being an artist, they can't stick to the same things everytime otherwise you'll all get bored and complain. I love SHINee for trying something new and out of their comfort zone!! Well done to them!!!",17,2016-10-04T21:37:33Z

@jjongmander7586,"I RESPECT ALL OF YOUR OPINIONS, BUT FOR ME THIS COMEBACK IS ONE OF A KIND!!! ಥ⌣ಥ

I am really amazed how SHINee used an 80s or 90s concept for this comeback and not use what's trending in this generation, which is EDM or Electronic Dance Music. For me, that's a brave and heroic thing to do. I think SHINee wants to make us remember how KPOP started in the past even before they debuted. I also think this is a tribute to the legendary groups who opened Hallyu or spread KPOP internationally. I am really proud of SHINee for doing this kind of stuff and even though a lot of people think their concept is outdated, I STILL THINK THIS COMEBACK IS AWESOME ❤❤❤ 'cause I'm a Shawol, what can I do?

@michaelmarquez5999,"This is very reminiscent of songs from 80's and 90's. I feel like Michael Jackson has been so influential to SHINee in their music, that's the feel I get from this song and this song is such a nice change from all the modern day, EDM style music. I'm not a fan of EDM but I don't mind it as long as there's good singing mixed in, though I much prefer ""plainer"" music that doesn't have so many electronic sounds.

I think Onew rocks this concept so well, shout out to the most underrated member please.",14,2016-10-04T19:59:05Z

@mikegonzales5059,"well...I've always been a fan, but honesty I don't like it. what the hell is one of the most successful entertainment companies doing making a low budget Shinee music video. there's no concept except for the outfits. everybody sounds worse except for jonhhyun. auto tune? sure, if you wanna be famous for 10 minutes. taemin has less breath in his voice. and sure it may be better for the song overall, but that just tells me the songwriter can't incorporate each individuals talent. there's only seen a few shots of the dance and its too hyped. it doesn't match the song either. I feel like it's compensating for something. this is disappointing. I'm tired of cheap products especially coming from something like shinee. sm town doesn't care enough.",12,2016-10-04T19:53:10Z

But I still have high hopes that I would see retro in this comeback. I've known SHINee since I was in junior high school and now I'm on the last semester in college. I'm not bashing them, just give them comment as advices. So, SHINee could improve. I know SHINee never let Shawol down or something. So, I support them. Beside that, I like how they try to give new vibes in the middle of KPop which is so into EDM or whatever it is these days. Hwaiting, SHINee!😊😊",0,2016-10-04T19:38:39Z

@Samantha_Lee,This is so awesome!! The song is catchy and I like how simple the mv is. This is only the second Korean Shinee comeback that I have experienced as a fan (the first was Married To The Music obviously) but I feel like I've known them for 7 years. Yes that's oddly specific but that's how long it feels like. Does anyone know if Onew is better now and will he be dancing during the promotions?,0,2016-10-04T19:21:50Z

@ninisoo6537,"I've been a fan of Shinee for 6 years now. I'm a fan of every kpop group you can think of but the group that has touched me the most has been Shinee. Their music is music that stands out to me. I'm thankful that they've been together for so many years and I hope they'll continue to grow together as a family. Shinee shows that even though there are many ups and downs, you can still make it together. To all the people who start ""fandom wars"" or just talk about other groups like they are trash, or bring people down for what they like, or say hurtful words, or fight meaningless fights with their friends of close ones, we should all learn something from Shinee. 
- sincerely, a Kpop fan since 2009/2010",3,2016-10-04T18:10:27Z

@charhoang,"RIGHT SHINee's finally back so it's time to start streaming this MV as much as you can! here is a guide:


STEP 1: sign out of your youtube account/use an incognito tab. 

STEP 2: watch the whole video. you don't actually have to watch it - although it's better if you do just to appreciate shinee's hard work - but make sure it plays the whole way through. and make sure you're watching the official mv from smtown's official channel! 

STEP 3: replay the video. do NOT click refresh or paste the link into the address bar again. instead manually search the video by typing in 'shinee 1of1' in the search bar, or going to smtown's official channel and looking for it

STEP 4: repeat, repeat, repeat. every 5-7 watches, clear your browser cache. every 30min change your IP address; you can do this by turning data on and off if you're using mobile data or by plugging + unplugging your wifi router. 

STEP 5: the most important step - SHARE THE VIDEO. shove it in everybody's faces, make them watch it. talk about it, spread the word. and who knows? maybe they become fans of shinee too! 

TIPS ⬇
▪️ put the volume up at least half way! 
▪️ try to stream at at least 720p
▪️ make a youtube playlist, but include other shinee official videos in it too, like 1of1's teaser! 
▪️ watch short videos in between streaming the mv! youtube will look for 'real' views, so make it look like you're watching it legitimately!",0,2016-10-04T17:37:16Z

Dont get me wrong, I love SHINee and they did the best they could with what they were given. Just butt hurt over SMgimmedarevenueplis being a dick again.

@leafasauruss,"I know in large part its due to financial reasons but it always makes me sad when a group has to neglect a member in order to steam ahead with a comeback, and the fact this is the second MV of SHINees to not feature all the members fully (I know that Onew's at least in this one) makes me sad. Timings a bitch I suppose but the song and routine are still killer, just hope he can perform with them as a whole so we can get a proper insight into the performance as a whole.",1,2016-10-04T16:53:41Z

@lottiel468,I don't know why but Shinee having a comeback gives me hope?? Because so many people were spreading shit that they weren't getting a comeback this year and that they might disband and do solo projects. So many Netizens say these things about lots of different groups and it makes me so happy to see Shinee prove them wrong 💚,1,2016-10-04T16:45:38Z

Just like each minute and each second are different
Day by day, you become new
You’re the first of the first
That means you’re the only one
Your voice that calls out to me
Lightly comes and slips into my ear
Your touch that I can feel in my hands
Brings me to the dazzling world that I’ve never been in before
You’re 1 of 1 girl
Only one
You are my answer, without a doubt
You’re 1 of 1 girl
It’s perfect
You’re already incomparable
You’re the only meaning of my world
A person like you has a name of Only One
As if you’ve put on the perfect color, yeah
Like a sweet song that passes my ear
You perfectly match, I keep singing about you
Like the feeling I felt for the first time, always replay (replay)
Your love newly shines
Once again, I’m fallin, fallin for you (come here)
I could never get sick of saying I love you
A sweet kiss
Footsteps that only match each other
Without any warning, our eyes met
Why are you so beautiful?
(Let’s go) You’re my baby
You’re 1 of 1 girl
Only one
You are my answer, without a doubt
You’re 1 of 1 girl
It’s perfect
You’re already incomparable
You’re the only meaning of my world
1 of 1 girl
Only one
You fill me up without any empty spots
You’re 1 of 1 girl
It’s perfect
You’re irreplaceable
You’re the only meaning of my world
I’m so deeply into you, I’m changing
When my heart, that is lit up with your light, rises up
I will shine on you
You’re 1 of 1 girl
Only one
You are my answer, without a doubt
You’re 1 of 1 girl
It’s perfect
You’re already incomparable
You’re the only meaning of my world
1 of 1 girl
Only one
You fill me up without any empty spots
You’re 1 of 1 girl
It’s perfect
You’re irreplaceable
You’re the only meaning of my world
You’re 1 of 1 girl
You’re 1 of 1 girl
You are my answer, without a doubt
You’re 1 of 1 girl

Hmm.. Shinee style, I do see that. Music is nice or at least it sounds nice, even though I don´t know what the lyrics mean, but all the english I can think of the meaning. ^^ 

I was so ""why"", when I noticed one of the members didn´t dance, but thankfully there is always people at comment section that writes about it, so no one doesn´t have to worry. Mostly I am happy about the fact that he wasen´t forced to dance. Onew I hope your feeling ok now. ^^ Shinee Hwaiting!",0,2016-10-04T16:40:07Z

@jjjj9449,"Wow...For those who complain about their music and mv: I guess some of foreign kpop fans are not so open nor appreciating the art&music. Aren't you so intolerant. Did you just say cheap and common?? Shinee is known as a CONTEMPORARY GROUP who lead new trends and style. They've always been frontrunners of kpop music and kpop style(at least) in Korea. If you guys are looking for the same copy&paste idol music and mv, you are barking up the wrong tree. No other kpop groups can beat their distinctive uniqueness and that's flat. Their mv would be simple yet classy and sensuous. +No doubt they would slay everything just with their voices and harmony.",1,2016-10-04T16:32:54Z

@beyonddoodles4236,"Fandoms fight, people complain
Fandoms try to support other fandoms, people still complain
I understand its annoying to see comments like ""_____ here to support ___"" but they are most likely wanting to join the fandom (since they are supporting) 

Also why don't y'all say that to other fandoms (not gonna name coz don't wanna start shitstorm) who are commenting the same? Why only ask armys to keep their mouths shut? 

Just appreciate their support and increase in views. Stop focusing of negative things and try to enjoy the music and use that time and energy to stream the video to increase views

Who cares about which fandom you're from? If you like this song, then you don't need to mention your fandom.

Also, don't get me started on these comments:
ARMY here supporting Shinee!
iGOT7 here to support Shinee!

Again, who the fuck cares?! You think a measly view would support the group? You want to support them, buy their albums. Just stop mentioning your goddamn fandom.

@niyakurniya6592,"I love SHINee, but somehow I feel disappointed this comeback. I understand the concept shinee is the era of the 90s, but why SM always choose the type of music EDM. Sorry I do not mean to compare the other SM artists, but I think it is very different when SM preparing EXO songs like monster and lotto. I'm so sorry, I do not want fanwar, this is just my opinion. Despite that I still support and love SHINee 😘😘💞💞",0,2016-10-04T16:02:10Z

@STAN_LOONA,"For everyone wondering why they couldn't wait for Onew to heal, I don't think you realize how much planning goes into an MV. Even a simple one. They need to rent the space, build the set, hire workers, set the filming for when they don't have any other activities, and they have to keep on time with their arranged promotions on music shows etc. It's extremely difficult as well as costs a ton of money even just to move it a week later.",0,2016-10-04T16:01:02Z

@deebow4813,I love the fact that they switch things up a lot. Also this is one of the few MVs I've seen that doesn't hide the extras/dancers in the beak ground. Especially since they had so many of them. For some reason I just liked being able to see their faces; it just made it seem a little it more cohesive and it actually looked like a lot of fun to shoot. I'm a new shawol myself (a few months) but I'm so glad I was able to be here for at least this comeback (hopefully more in the future).,0,2016-10-04T15:48:52Z

@maeryllaine,I'm kinda dissapointed on the mv . The f*ck SM? Is this only what u can give to our shinee boys? I mean they can do more than this. The management seems like they're taking easy on shinee. I like the song but the mv is a no no. It's kinda boring. I miss the old mv of shinee :(,0,2016-10-04T15:45:04Z

@kidleader993,"i think its good they include onew in this one eventhough he still injured, its better then not showing him at all, but wouldn't be great for shinee and SM to wait till onew get fully recover from his injury so that he could participate in all the activity including the mv making and also the promotion for the song, i bet onew will miss the couple of music show comeback later on, its such a shame, why they look so hurry with this comeback, i'm pretty sure shinee will be doing just fine and pretty much the same with  or without onew's injury, they still gonna slay all the music chart and win many music show, bottom line is, patient is gold, waiting for onew fully recover and shoot the MV are the best thing, i don't care how long will it take for him to heal as long he's healthy and can promote, also this comeback are amazing, u can feel jamming to the song all day long, shinee sound!!",0,2016-10-04T15:43:43Z

@misaaami2455,"the more i read the comment, the more i applaud SHINee for agreeing to have 90s concept this time. Like, i dont think other groups can be this brave to pull on something risky like this. Hairstyle, fashion, music videos, poses on their pic teasers. and even people who dont know anything about SHINee's comeback this year can feel the 90s in them.
so i can say that SM and SHINee has already succeed to bring back this concept to the future haha",0,2016-10-04T15:25:17Z
