@seowol9955,어렸을때 많이 들었는데 잊고 살다가 최근에 너무 힘들어지니까 갑자기 생각나더라. 간만에 다시 들으니까 위로되는 것 같아... 처음 들었을 때도 가사 좋다고 생각했는데 지금 들어도 좋다. 제이민 다른 노래도 좋은 거 많아요! 컴백 기원🙏,0,2025-04-29T09:59:03Z

당당하게 하늘을 봐 이제 시작일 뿐이야 어깰 펴
네 안에 같은 네가 있어 힘들어도 포기 말아 너의 미래
일어나 손을 잡아 세상을 가져

시간이 흐르면 꽃잎이 떨어지듯이 구름은 비를 약속해
몸부림 쳐봐도 하늘의 마음대로 달라질 수 있어 Don't worry Never mind
그날을 기다려

당당하게 하늘을 봐 이제 시작일 뿐이야 어깰 펴
네 안에 같은 네가 있어 힘들어도 포기 말아 다시 한번
일어나 손을 잡아 다시 일어나

일어나 고갤 들어 oh oh woo
제발 흔들리지 말아 이제 시작일 뿐이야 어깰 펴

Unless a big idol had a comeback, the charts are always full with rock artists it's what the majority of people in Korea likes and certainly not K-pop.

@Sanafield,"- maybe it was her choise and she likes it that way or else as you said she would've changed companies a long time ago. She debuted in 2007, so her contract must've ended awhile ago, I guess she wanted to stay and did. Regardless of how big S.M is, they had a lot of failing artists(talented ones) and ofc you wouldn't know about them because they failed.",0,2013-11-04T23:10:43Z

I don't know if it's wise for her to change companies because she'll just rotten somewhere if she did. I personally knew her through her Japanese singles and she's amazing.

@Joaninhaa12,"Well, she promotes mainly in Japan. Someone who is not familiar with Japanese music might not know her. I'm pretty sure Korea enjoys rock, but kpop artists don't seem to be as popular as fans might think - so, someone from a label like SM Ent will probably be seen as a pretty face without much talent.
Also, SM doesn't seem to promote anything other than idol groups properly. I'm a SM stan and I'm forever amazed at how artists like J-Min and TRAX are underrated because they are not well promoted.",0,2013-09-12T14:22:05Z

@monalisasmilex,She's not a new artist. She has been in SMTOWN for quite a while. She just has been promoting in Japan rather than Korea since Korea isn't too big of mainstream rock. & I also think SMTOWN doesn't know how to promote her properly in Korea which is why she barely does anything there. You should search more of her on youtube. ,0,2012-10-24T22:05:25Z

@MyJelly97,u must be an sm hater. like frick most of us dont care what was better. we like the korean version k? and also we dont need your damn opinion about this drama and you shouldnt be going to the ost's and bashing it. i thought sulli looked so cute to look like a guy and minhos hair was just awesome. AND i overreact when water sprays on my or my friends. like seriously? please go away.,0,2012-10-12T13:13:14Z
@TheAnamenia,"A high school girl will do anything to meet and get close to a boy she idolizes. Jae Hee is in love with Tae Joon, a pole-jumping gold medalist. She discovers that he attends high school at an all-boys’ school, so she cuts her hair and pretends to be a boy to be admitted to the school. But she soon learns that trying to blend in with the boys and keep her true identity a secret are no easy tasks.How long can she keep up the ruse, and will it all be worth the effort in the end?

@Myaccount923,"Oh please no you didn't. You came here because you wanted a place to complain about SM and this drama just like all the other SM haters out there.

Sure you're allowed to express your opinion. I just don't see your point of coming to a video of the friggin OST of the drama you apparently think sucked. If i didn't like a drama, i wouldn't be lurking around the OST videos. but maybe that's just me.

Get in line hun. All in all, the drama was done. Try complaining about something else.",0,2012-10-12T02:46:06Z
@Tsubasa9981,"Wow idk who you are, but that's some attitude. People should respect your opinions, but you should respect that TBY was Hana Kimi in a KOREAN style. Most girls impersonating guys in Korean dramas, well, sound like girls, and not just in SM dramas (have you seen Your Beautiful?). I've read the manga, and I don't think there's anything wrong with redoing the same story line over and over if its timeless and popular. Just look at Romeo and Juliet, theres like a gazillion versions out there. ",0,2012-10-12T01:45:34Z
@soheexsarang,"1. I came here to listen to the song
2. I'm allowed to post my own opinion. It's called freedom of speech
3. Have you ever read the manga? She's suppose to be impersonating a boy. Sulli didn't really try, her voice sounded like a girl.
4. beauty is differs for everyone
5. SM is lacking creativity. And I think an original storyline would have been better than being the 3rd to remake hana kimi.

you replied, so you could achieve what exactly? 
Prove to me your a SME fan girl who loves all they do?",0,2012-10-12T00:46:35Z
@Myaccount923,"Then why are you here? lol you came here to repeat the same complaints, so you could achieve what exactly? And well i personally think this was the best
1. Sulli looks like a girl? Great, she is one. I didn't find the JPN girl attractive at all, but i mostly don't find JPN people attractive. koreans though. are amazing.
2. SM isn't lacking creativity. they just wanted to put their own spin on things, what's the big deal?

taiwan ver = BEST; then japan (funniest), and this was the worst (awkward)

1. SULLI looks like a GIRL (=.=), but I found the JPN girl prettier. The taiwan girl really looked like a boy and then was pretty later one. WOW.
2. minho overreacted when she was going to get sprayed with water. Who does that? O..O 
3. hate minho's hair cut
4. SME shows the lack of creativity by being the 3rd and remake hana kimi =.=

And, I haven't seen the drama yet - but just from this I think they did well in choosing Minho and Sulli. Minho really has that whole athletic feel, and even though I had a different feel from the guy in the manga, Minho is really a good choice for the part! Sulli is really pretty and cute, and she can actually pass for a boy (this is a culture thing I think, none of my girl friends would be able to pull that off - they certainly wouldn't keep their feminity) ",0,2012-09-25T17:53:50Z

@isavielsenivoy9406,....Can't you upload the 1080P version...?,0,2012-09-19T12:56:29Z
@webmasterd,Not new. She's been around for a while but ONLY focused in Japan. But she's been performing with her SM family at smtown concerts (see fancams).  Stand Up has been nicely accepted by korean fans because of the drama TTB so this is her Korean debut. I'm happy for her. Oddly this type of rock-oriented music is not that popular now in japan since kpop has hit there. So now opposite her music is very refreshing to hear in kpop now. ,0,2012-09-19T12:55:13Z
@opisthobranch,"I think that SM is wrongly assuming that SuJu is on their last legs, as they have long outlived most K-pop bands of their generation... and are approaching their 30s... (LeeTeuk has been active since 2000!)... so they came up with EXO to replace them, not realizing that it would take a while for EXO to build SuJu's level of fandom.",0,2012-09-19T12:54:23Z

@fancypantsloser,"I didn't say she was underrated but UN/UNDEREXPOSED. No one can deny that she can sing, she just doesn't have enough platforms to sing through for people to notice. The reason I am frustrated is because SM isn't trying. Its not like they invested a lot of time and money into getting her to have a proper debut - a la EXO. She's been involved in a lot of backstage work that really isn't fair for someone of her calibre. She did some gigs in Japan but not much came out of that.",0,2012-09-19T09:13:35Z

@CocoEng,"I SERIOUSLY LOVE THIS SONG! 
The message in this song can inspire many of us. I know it inspired me.... it's like telling us not to give up and if you're put down you can always get back up. SM has really done it this time! :D They should promote J-Min more in Korea instead of in Japan. WHO TOLD YOU TO DEBUT HER THE SAME TIME AS SNSD?!?!?! This seriously puts the drama to #1, her to #1 and the company to #1 ^^
J-Min FIGHTING! :D
