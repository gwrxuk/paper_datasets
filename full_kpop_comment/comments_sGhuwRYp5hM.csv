@00600jpg,"I saw a video on TikTok that said NCTzen have being condition to like very song NCT releases even if its trash  but my dudes  it ain’t like that. I just love experimental music it’s not always gonna slap but when it does it does. Ten vocals on this song alone got me hooked and out of the NCT founding fathers jaehyun is my bias. If you close yourself off to new types of music your going to be stuck listening to the same types of songs. Music is art experiment the crap out of it

@tajaunathompson267,"First let me just say this was long overdue for this particular Unit. I've really missed this combination every sense the 7th Sense days I've been hooked. I like NCT as a Whole.  What makes them really special and unique is not just their overall Talent or the fact that with this group you get different Units which then showcases everybody individually level of Talent. The specialty about this entire group is the unexpected, they have been known to go in the craziest direction Musically and have it work. they're not afraid of using different producer from other countries and they also are not afraid to try something different and test those Waters sort of speak. This Song Is Banging, The Choreography is Sick, Ten is just dripping with Swag in this Video actually they all are. But he added a little more Flavor.   The Visuals are Of Course on point, and that Beat is insane.  Can't forget about the Baggy Jeans that fashion from Hair to Makeup, and clothes its all 10 across the board.",11,2023-08-31T15:32:51Z

@Necroherz,"But why was Jaehyun's ""Baggy, baggy, baggy, baggy, baggy, baggy jeans"" part so sexual... I want hear it again on a loop 👀🔥.. Also in the actual MV the most babygirl there was Mark and then Taeyong. Now in the performance was definitely you Jae hahah. I love the fluidity of Ten, man, he's so flexible is like a man of water. Mark was the perfect choice for those stylistic raps, that ""YEAH BOYYYY!!!"" will be forever iconic . Taeyong's sharpness and precision is flawless but also his lightness makes everything look easy on him, every move in every beat. Doyoungie is one of our main vocalist and i appreciate his efforts dancing so much, our bunny did it perfectly i'm so proud 🥺

Man i can't be more proud of my neos, even of SM Ent. which is not surprising i mean i love-hate this agency for many reasons but in terms of creativity and production, music and musically you're my number one always. Baggy Jeans was def in all the aspects the right decision. This performance was exquisite and well done, thank you so much 😭",7,2023-08-31T09:44:00Z

this unit is just full of aces and i honestly cant think of any other groups that can pull off this concept the way that nct does!!
literally everything about this performance is perfection and the members balance each other so well that i had to rewatch this multiple times just to focus on each member individually
like i was so proud watching doyoung dancing bc he has improved soooo much since t7s and his vocals are just top tier
and mark's ad libs also add such a vibe to this song like that yeeeah boyyyy at 2:07 ??!! like u bet im gonna be awooing along w them
jaehyun and ten are srsly just such talented all rounders the vocals and dance and visuals they can do no wrong!!
and ofc our leader just delivers and serves every single time like he is really the neoest of the neos and im in awe as to how he embodies and slays the concept every damn time!!
this song is just peak creative genius and they were all born to be performers",6,2023-08-31T05:32:25Z

Ten said he wished he could have another project with the 7th sense unit, I wonder if he knew then or if someone decided it would actually be a good idea to get them back together, anyhow I'm really stoked it did happen!",8,2023-08-30T22:55:00Z

It's in parts like 0:18 or 0:34 where they are not the main focus and don't need to go all out you can see how they never just execute the moves, but add sooo much feeling to it. Their focus is unwavered as if it's their part to shine. 0:51 like the way they ALL can execute it with so much flavor?? who else does it like them?? Jaehyun is a fantastic lead dancer and he really gets on their level whenever it's his part.

@markuslee6204,"mark is one of the the best main dancers there is imo. he has the natural swag and he knows how to work with it and use it to his advantage. nct as a group has a hip-hop based choreographies and mark excels in it bc of this main reason. look at how much details he puts in dancing. the movement of his head, the graceful flicks of his hands and arms, his powerful chest pops, his groovy hips and legs, and his insane footwork. what i like abt mark's execution of choreographies is how he internalized what is needed and what best suits the vibe of the song and dance. he embodies it all too well that it shows on how perfect he is on their performances. mark just know how to kill it. always on point, not doing too much and not doing less.",5,2023-08-30T15:20:22Z

@luhluna8,Ten just stands out bc his dancing style is advanced! But Taeyong knows how to capture ur attention bc his stage presence he just draws ur attention to him.
