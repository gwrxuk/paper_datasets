@jorgegar1993,Is it just me or does it feel that Hit overshadowed this song even though this is technically the title and/or leading track? Idk much though but that' just the impression I get. I'm a baby carat so maybe someone who was a carat when An Ode came out can comment on it. Hit is absolute banger but this one is severely underrated imo. Just look at them!,3,2023-03-20T12:50:12Z

@sydney468,"i only got into kpop last 2020 and bts was the 1st group i ever stanned. i was ignorant of other groups and only watched bts thinking that no other group can compare bc of their popularity w the fans/charts/awards. i really thought they were the standard but then i recently got into other groups bc of bts hiatus and discovered svt through hybe picnic. i just realized that popular isn't always good. but i'm not saying bts isn't good, there are just a lot more other groups who deserve more recognition for their talent rather than popularity. 

2020 kpop fan me loved knowing that bts won best dance for boy with luv (and all the other major awards). but today honestly svt's choreo for fear deserved it. it's not something that u can cover easily and also those movements/symbolisms/formations are mesmerizing. svt deserves more recognition from award shows in general ❤

also i'm this close to unstanning bts bc of the toxic fandom 😅",9,2022-09-20T16:03:34Z

@blessed-cursed7530,"I have so much respect for Seventeen. I can watch this choreography a hundred times and I will still be impressed by how amazing their dances are. It's just so smooth energetic and calculated like they know exactly where to go at which moment for each member to perform his line it's so impressive especially when you know that they're quite a lot in the group we're not gonna lie. The transitions are smooth like butter and AAAHHH I don't even have words anymore. It's a feeling I have only with Seventeen like I'm actually speechless. I know that when I want to learn a dance from Seventeen it will take me MONTHS cause it just has so much details and it's hard to learn it when you're alone.
It's my favourite choreography from all time.",27,2022-04-17T01:23:12Z

@alex-fs9yt,"Seventeen: just one of the few groups where all of the members are good at dancing. People always say that about other groups they stan, and while it may true that there isn't a bad dancer in the group, there's still usually a big gap between the dance line and the rest of the group. But every member in Seventeen is good at dancing. All of them are competent and skilled enough to keep up and hold their own. I think that is also a big part of why they are the most synchronised kpop group since their debut in 2015. Because even though the performance team is amazingly talented, experienced and skilled, the other members are still very competent dancers and can keep up with choreos. It doesn't matter if the member has a vocal or rapper position, he keeps up with the choreo and has good dancing technique. Seventeen really didn't skimp on dance training or choreography.

 ROMANS 10:9-11“If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. As Scripture says, “Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame”

God wants us to believe in His One and Only Son, Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior, who died for our sins :D When we truly believe in our hearts that Jesus is Son of God who died for our sins on the cross, we are saved from the eternal fire and have eternal life in Christ Jesus!! 💖 May God bless y’all!!",3,2021-04-06T23:56:05Z

@moonschild7272,"One of the reasons I like watching Seventeen choreography is the level of group synchronicity they display, which is really off the charts. With this type of camera movement, you lose a good chunk of that in between the frames that display the whole group. You also lose the formation changes. I think static shots for choreography videos are fine because I came for the choreography. If I want fancy, visually pleasing camera work, I will just watch a music video. While can appreciate the work, I don't particularly think it is necessary or does the choreography justice.",12,2020-07-06T07:59:01Z

We should respect him more in my opinion because hoshi works as much as Woozi

Y’all know that first thirty something seconds? Seems simple enough, right? Took me a good thirty minutes to learn, and my toes were dead by the end of it. And it’s so detailed. As if one hand is controlling the other. A lot of the hand movements sync almost perfectly with the instrumental ‘beats’ we hear throughout the song. It’s amazing. Seriously. Stunning. And difficult 😅

I would like to point out that I am very inexperienced in dance and have been trying to learn the choreography by watching this video at 0.25 speed. Probably not the most simple way to go, but it’s easiest for me.",2,2020-03-18T22:40:56Z

@_fake_mu6753,"Seventeen literally exists as choreography lessons. Now, I don't know much about kpop, but I love watching Seventeen's choreography videos. The reason they're so nice to watch dance is not particularly just because the dance is impressive (which it IS), but because they understand the song is a singing/rapping performance first. Therefore, the choreography more or less centers around getting people in the right places at the right times and making switches clear. 


Take 1:23 through 1:34, for example. We transition out of the last dance section into this one by literally walking through the previously set up formation, re-centering focus for this new thing. Then, they set up three layers of performers over each other, so that when it was time for one person to end and the next to begin, the previous group just walking, nothing fancy, just walking, and your eyes were already on the next people that were important. 


But that was a formation they made and used over the course of twenty seconds; however, their planning ahead is INSANE. Baseball cap boyo over here has his position in the formation set by 0:14, right of pick hair mcgee. It isn't until 0:46, over 30 seconds later that this position pays off, allowing him to seamlessly take focus while going right instead of left. They thought about what needed to happen here to transition to viewer through one singer into the next, and focused one him being exactly where he needed to be at the beginning of the song to make that happen. I know there's a running joke of ""I bet you didn't see them do this,"" especially if you're watching the art that is Pretty U, but it's true for a reason. At 1:00, everyone is dancing in one formation, completely in sync, no one off doing their own thing. Then, at 1:14, the dance separates to reveal four people that seemingly had no part of the previous dance. But they must have. To pull this off, the four were positioned off the back-sides of the triangle formation, so that when they broke off, the triangle just got slightly smaller. Point is, the formations are thought about meticulously so that the dance remains fluid while watching it.


Finally, let's take a look at how they use the center to carry meaning. Perhaps best shown at 1:50. This grimace-hair looking boy is established as our focal point pretty simply: he's standing, no one else is. Awesome, but they everyone needs to be standing when the next drop starts, so what do they do? They set the formation center to the left of where the singer is, still allowing you to see the singer perfectly while everyone standing; they make sure to only do small dance moves to not draw to much attention before the drop. Then, when the beat does drop, the dance becomes intense and expressive again, redrawing your focus 0.2 millimeters to the left, back to center, to the next line of focus. Which then runs through the same procedure as 1:23 - 1:34.


These videos are dance videos, sure, but the dance first-and-formost is concerned with maintaining clear communication for who is singing, and all of this information is seamlessly incorporated into the dance, so the song no longer exists apart from it. The two are linked. The dance won't make sense without the song, and the song makes less sense without the dance. I think part of why I find so much enjoyment in watching their choreography is because, as you can probably tell, I don't know anyone's names. Therefore, I have no bias that I'm particularly focused on, and I'm able to watch the song from a more-or-less outsider point of view, just focusing on whatever the heck my eyes follow. But jeez, their choreography is in a league of its own from anything I've ever seen. In summary, colorful hair bois bounce beautifully. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk. 


P.S: Just an appreciation for 2:31, where they rotate on beat. The four steps match the hi-hats into the drop, which is just beautiful and I love it, and that must've been hard.",2622,2019-12-07T16:09:20Z

@soup7751,"Everyone, and I mean everyone, in the kpop industry are allowed to have opinions. But the fact is that Seventeen are the kings of synchronization in kpop, period. It doesn't matter if you're a multistan or not, I am and I still say they ARE the most synchronized group, you can't lie. 







And it's not that other groups don't have the same synchronization level as Seventeen, but it's because in majority of their choreographs they use a specific part to demonstrate their dancing level specifically. Atleast in my opinion, I could be wrong.",2,2019-11-18T15:27:51Z

@carljustineclavecillas8834,SEVENTEEN is also king of Details How? As a dancer this is my opinion about this Choreography. This might not be the Hardest Choreography of Seventeen but it is full of emotion. Like woozi's build up part he catches every beats of the music. And also 1:20 notice how Jeonghan's foot synchronized with Mingyu standing up. And joshua vibrating moves at the start is also cool (damn those details) they are one of the best groups now.

@musicq608,After listening to everything I could find where Seventeen talks about this song it became apparent to me that the reason for the camera movement in this is to mimic the effects of being intoxicated. It seems as though they want Carats to feel the way they do when poisoned by their fears. I personally think that this effect is genius and really connects us to them on an even deeper level. They are inviting us to see and feel the song and choreography from their perspective and that is so very special. I love them more and more every day because of things like this. You did well my loves!!!💗💙💗💙,1860,2019-10-17T00:57:00Z

@ninicarat2902,"SEVENTEEN's choreography has always been captivating on its own. The formation, the subtle yet meaningful details in their moves, the way each member's part is highlighted and of course their signature synchronization, put all these together and you'll find it's never enough to truly appreciate their work of art. Personally, I think a simple choreography video is enough because we can get to see the full picture of the dance with all member. There is no need for flashy camera work and the constant camera movements just makes it more distracting. But after all, I understand that they're working hard to show us their best. So, ""Thank you SEVENTEEN for giving us this fascinating song and dance. You've worked hard and we appreciate that!""",237,2019-10-05T14:01:00Z

For those actually wanting to see the choreography as it was designed to be viewd by a live audience, this is distracting. It's artistic and I appreciate the hard work of who produced it,  but... I need one like the video for ""Thanks"".

This choreography video is nice, but it's nothing we haven't seen before on their music show appearances. is it too much to ask for just a single shot dance practice?",0,2019-09-24T17:32:12Z

@becca_138,"The dance is 10/10.  BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHY I LILE STILL CAMERA DANCE PRACTICE'S.  If I wanted to watch the performance and get dizzy while doing I'd watch a music show.  I watch the dance practices to see all the members doing all the moves.  The dance is already fabulous so I don't see why they think there has to be ""added intensity"" or whatever to make people interested.  The camera work's not bad or anything  and you can see that their budget went up, but that's not why I watch dance practices, if you wanna have a fancy dance video. Do a dance ver. Of the music video, but leave the practices with a still camera.  I just wanna see all of it.  The dance again is incredible (but this is seventeen we're talking about so it goes without saying) but all I want is to see all of it.",0,2019-09-24T15:25:05Z

@wanderingheathen4426,"I feel like the only comments I'm seeing are about the camerawork and it's kinda sad. Seventeen are trying to go for a more serious version of themselves and be more artistic. They're not always going to be silly or have a fixed camera and we as true CARATs need to support whatever artistic decisions they make. I personally LOVE the camerawork. It felt more professional and was very beautiful. So fluid. When they use a still camera I can't focus on the member in the center because my eyes always try and find my bias, so having the moving camera makes it easier to focus on who's in the center.
With that being said, GOOD JOB BOYS. SO PROUD OF YOU ALL FOR THE AMAZING ALBUM AND CHOREO.

My sensitivity to movement means that dance practices like this trigger severe seasickness. This video is literally unwatchable for me. 🤢 We get it, the comeback was profitable! You made money! You paid for pricier camerawork as a flex, okay, fine! From now on just do normal dance practices that don’t make me too nauseous to even watch!!! Come on, Pledis, you had such a good record with dance practices 😞",2,2019-09-24T12:17:30Z

@AlM22,"Why does Mingyu never do the choreography during his part now? He never does it in the live stages, just walks forward and now even in the *choreography* video he still doesn't do it??? He does it in the music video which is why I'm confused. If the whole time he was supposed to just walk forward like Chan in his part and he never did the choreo in the first place then fair enough (I do kinda wish Chan danced during his part too -since he's THE Michael Chanson, dance legend. Plus the backup choreo is the same in his and Mingyu's part which implies if Mingyu originally danced to that part, Chan probably did too.. but we never saw if he did in the first place so I will accept it). But the fact he was supposed to do the choreo since we see he does it in the MV but then for some reason they changed it to just him walking? idk his part has less of an impact now in my opinion since the way he and they all came in with the strong moves made it like ""wow"" in the MV. Shame. Yeah he looks hot just walking with his facial expressions, but the part seems more stagnant now imo. I get that perhaps for live stages they decided for him not to do it so he could keep more stable vocals idk? (then again Jihoon & Seungkwan sing while dancing their parts so doubt it and Seungcheol, Hansol do while rapping too). But at least in the official choreo video I would have expected it. Ah well... just seems weird to me but ok. ANYWAYYY THEY ALL SLAYED THIS!!!! WOOOO 13 KINGSSSSSS ♥",0,2019-09-24T11:34:52Z

@Nat-qf7ds,"I love how the camera 96% of the time has to look up to them. Really shows how they are standing *above* their fears, how they're stronger than their fears. There are only about 3-4 times when the camera is clearly looking down on them (2x in the beginning when they're crouching/kneeling on the floor, once slightly when Vernon starts rapping, and once when Woozi is 'solo'dancing to show the others behind him), and they're all in the beginning. For me, it clearly says that in the beginning, their fears still try to take hold of them, to put them under itself. But they don't let it. Which, you know, is a beautiful message to say not only through music and dance, but camera work as well. Wonderful job!",0,2019-09-24T10:17:14Z
