@crappycrafter,"I love that there are so many comments praising Scoups for how amazing of an all-rounder he is. Most videos I don't see a ton of Cheol comments and I always really wanna hop in there and throw some in because I just think he is such an amazing leader and talented cute and funny person. They all really slayed it with this choreo. Woozi and Hoshi are also such amazing dancers. The engergy from these three just shows why they are the leaders. Scoups is such a powerful dancer, rapper, singer, and leader and I just thoroughly enjoyed getting to see more of him showing off those moves. This song goes so hard too, they really brought the heat with this one.",16,2024-06-06T02:26:08Z

The person who writes and produces and still takes time to make sure his members are happy and healthy, the Lee Jihoon who even reminds his hyungs to rest and take care of themselves even tho the members often find him sleep in his studio because he was up all night making music. The Lee Jihoon who is amazing, selfless, beautiful, talented, and all around an Ace.",6,2022-08-06T07:36:56Z

We all acknowledge Hoshi's energy and pristine dance execution, and Woozi's musical genius and hard work - but today, I celebrate Seungcheol for all he does and is for Seventeen AND for Carats. Thank you, Cheolie.",523,2022-08-06T02:05:20Z

@user-in8xy8wd5b,"Leaders Line is a complete packaged.
Now let we appreciate S.Coups, actually maybe we casually didn't really pay attention to his overall performance, bcs idk, weirdly he seems radiate a lazy idols vibe. Unconsciously we could've think he mostly cheat for the choreo (skipping at some detail moves). 
But, the FACT is he really consistent and a hard worker as an idols, like I said, a complete packaged of vocal, facial expressions, and dance. Try to focus on him, and you definitely can see he's not cheating in some move, he's really slay it. 
He's really good at pointing which 'beats' needs to give 100% and which 'beats' you need to give lower than 100%, and he's isolation was great too, neck part, chest part, knee part, butt part, etc. 

S.Coups always an excellent performer. I'm always paying attention to him to see his sharp and detailed move.
Especially their latest choreo for Hot and Cheers, he's really great to performs it👏",2,2022-08-02T13:00:47Z
