한 번쯤 그런 적 있잖아
눈만 봐도 다 알 수가 있는 (wow yeah)
뭘 어쩌나 싶다가도
이 감정을 알고 싶은걸 (oh)

걸을 때 by my side
꽉 잡은 손도 놓치고 싶지가 않아
설레는 기분은 다 너라서 매우 좋아 다
내가 뭘 바라야 하니
내 맘은 이미 충분히
너로 너로 꽉 꽉 차 있네

This feels so right
너만 있으면 다 모든 게 좋아

넌 나에게 쉴 새 없이
꿀 떨어지는 damage야
철없이 아플 거야 난
아야 아야 아야

'Cause you, you're my everything
우린 알맞아 (ah yeh)
'Cause you, you're my everyday
너도 알잖아
난 네가 필요해, 넌 내가 필요해
'Cause you, you already know
Everything is you you

Good to me, good to me ay ya ya (wow oh oh oh oh)
Good to me, good to me ay ya ya (wow oh oh oh oh)
Good to me, good to me ay ya ya (wow oh oh oh oh) (ay ya ya)
Ay ya ya (ay ya ya) good to me (wow oh oh oh oh)

Yeh 네가 내 맘에 sign하는 사이에
나의 방화벽이 무너져 버린 지 오래

@eunbyuljung2463,"2015, when they're performed in front of people maybe @mbc channel. I saw they sing live and that's the part of vocal team and Jeonghan just catch my eyes with his black hat. But when i saw them all 13 member i think i couldnt stan them because so many member and too lazy for me to remember their name. But when i saw 17TV i could recognize a few member like Scoups, Woozi, Mingyu and Wonu that look alike, Seungkwan, Vernon and maybe Hoshi. But Jeonghan really made me fell for him. And then time had passed, i didnt really pay attention to them but i still enjoyed their song, watched their performance and then suddenly when i watched their live singing @ kiss the radio several month ago i just realized that maybe this is the true talented group that i must stan to. And now they're always fill my day with happiness. Sincerely, i really hope they will make it big and become the legend of kpop music industry. 🌹",3,2019-12-23T07:00:21Z

@dianamontoya6895,"It is a pity that the director of the video, has not realized how bad it looks. The dance of the boys is impeccable and perfect, as always, there is no complaint from them, but why the hell did the whole stage darken? What the hell has to do with the dark concept that so many defend? I do not think that the song itself has a dark concept, but more mature and sensual than in the other backs of the group.
Honestly, I did not like the video because it's too dark. If they wanted to do something different, they should have put on dim lights, either in sepia or red, but well lit.
The videos of the practices are so that fans can appreciate the whole dance, but this MV is too dark and does not look good, and to top it off, the camera is far away from them and the guys are dressed in black, at least the majority.
I understand that they did it in a hurry, but that has nothing to do with the final edition. It's disappointing, because this song I was looking forward to and now I feel very disappointed and sad for how bad they were. I repeat, SEVENTEEN IS GREAT, AS ALWAYS.",4,2019-01-31T03:18:59Z

Lets be serious though.. They did it again.. They are good at synchronization.. I know, I repeated this a multiple times.. But, duude! I cant just ignore the idea about it! I showed this vid to my classmates and I am so proud to call myself a carat.. I turned my teacher into a carat just by showing the MV of Home.. Just by looking at it, you wont believe that they just made the song and choreographies by themselves.. But.. Jeez!! They did it by themselves! Gosh.. I am so proud.. To those guys who told me that Seventeen just ruined my life.. All I can say is that they are my INSPIRATION! Without them, I might be gloomy today..

@itsrachelmay,"Carats, SVT is giving us so much with dance practices and behind the scenes! Let's give back in return by str3aming 'Home' MV, YMMD album and their livecam performances on Mnet and Inkigayo to help them get as many awards as possible this comeback! (How to help down below)

how to str3am:
1) If you have already watched 'Home' MV, Mnet and/or Inkigayo performances, clear your browsing history, watch history and search history on Youtube
2) Search up 'seventeen' in search bar and click the video
3) DO NOT SKIP THE AD unless it is longer than 1 minute (even then, I still watch usually)
4) Have Youtube volume 70% or higher, you can mute the browser but make sure the volume on the video is that
5) Watch in highest quality possible! Preferably 720p-1080p. 480p is ok if your internet is slow
6) DO NOT pause, skip, rewind... play video from the very beginning to the very end
7) Now watch two videos in between (Performances or other SVT mvs) or wait 10 mins before clearing your history and repeating
Even doing this 2-3x a day helps greatly!

for str3aming the album: 
-- DO NOT str3am on Youtube if the account is not official SVT channel, it will NOT count
-- str3am the album on Spotify or Apple Music, do NOT add the songs to your library or they will not count
-- you can have the whole album on repeat

@yoon-yy8vi,"My only complain about Seventeen's performance is that Pledis always set up a dim lighting whenever they perform songs like this, in concert,music show or award show. I know it's to set up the mood but it's so frustrating if you can't really see how cool the choreo is if it's too dark, ESPECIALLY when they're wearing dark clothes (like in this video). 

Can you imagine watching them in concert, far from the screen & among thousand of audience? Even when i'm at home watching them from screen,it's frustrating enough. I wanna see them, wanna see the choreo.",164,2019-01-29T13:21:14Z
