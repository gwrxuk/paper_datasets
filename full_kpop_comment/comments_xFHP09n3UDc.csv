The members randomly mimicking the Sorting Hat cracked me up xD
Money over friends.. there's so many issues that can arise from having that many friends o-o well.. could say same thing about the money but who needs to know I have that much money? :p live simply and people will be none the wiser.. 
Idk how I'd feel if i met up with a friend and they surprise brought a friend of theirs along.. would depend on situation and what the person's like o-o
Nobody thought about taking advantage of their magic and whatnot for the zombie apocalypse? lol
For the bad cook.. might as well tell them, but be nice about it. At least, I'd find it hard to pretend it's good because if it doesn't taste good (or worse, making me feel sick), wouldn't touch it much and that'd make it obvious to the friend that I didn't enjoy it.

Atas dasar inilah aku sering mengikuti kegiatan Jungwoo, maaf, aku bukan bermaksud untuk menciptakan war disini, tapi aku hanya mengikuti Jungwoo saja, tidak dengan yang lain,sebelumnya aku tidak bermaksud untuk mengikuti kegiatan NCT karena aku bukan fans garis keras k-pop, tapi semenjak melihat curhatan Haechan tentang Jungwoo yang tak pernah curhat membuatku berpikir setiap hari, seperti kebiasaanku juga, apalagi semenjak aku melihat video Jungwoo baru debut dengan sekarang berbeda jauh, sungguh aku kira yang di MV Boss NCT U itu bukan Jungwoo, jadi aku memutuskan untuk mengikuti aktivitas Jungwoo karena rasa penasaranku yang begitu tinggi, Jungwoo terasa berbeda dari yang lain, aku pun sudah 20 tahun lebih mengalami delusi dan selalu ditegur mertua dan kerabat suamiku karena sering terlihat bengong, tapi menurut yang aku rasakan, bengong itu bukan karena banyak pikiran tapi ada saja yang selalu dipikirkan sehingga tak bisa tidur",0,2023-05-12T02:40:15Z

Reason - if I have 2.2 billion friends, is it because they wanted to be my friends ? Or is it this magic wish that forced them to be my friend? And do these friends love and like each other? Will these friends end up competing to be my best friend and start wars?  If this isn’t free will.. the. Having that many friends is no different than having yes men all around you like in hollywood who are only your friend cause of clout..

It gotta be free will.. same with, if you wish for someone to love you, is that real love? #teamfreewill.  So I agree with ravenclaw guy.. a few very good friends . Also 2.2 billion dollars you can help a bunch of people who aren’t your friends…and if they want, they can become your friend…

@acutelilmint8035,"There’s another thing called vultology which I think is more acccurate.. it focuses on how we look and move.. and because peopel use different parts of their brain, it eventually shapes ur face based off the muscles you use..  also because of diff thinking process, you see it through body and hand movement too. I think it’s pretty cool.  P and J ,T, F you can really tell there is a difference there, and with eyes the shapes, which muscles are use sometimes explain why certain people with certain personalities seem to give off same vibe or have similar eyes.

Like S people tend to have sharper eyes vs N.. if you pay attention, you can even start to see where people are thinking ( internally , externally).

Take it with a grain of salt, but it’s pretty fun to try spotting patterns and stuff in behaviour and looks vs just what people say(cause I think anyone can really think of the same conclusions but it’s where they are thinking that shapes them..I dunno haha",0,2023-01-08T23:13:46Z

@miahgrass2511,"As an INFJ, I was so surprised to see Jungwoo picked 2.2 billion friends over money. I was 100% on Doyoung and Kun's side haha. No it's not about the money at all, it's about not being able to maintain that huge number of relationships, that's not something a typical introvert can handle. As an introvert, my energy usually gets drained off when there are too many people around, not to mention just thinking about how to balance all my relationships already makes me stressed out. I also agree with Doyoung about treating our friends wholeheartedly, it's like an unspoken responsibility toward them. Having 2.2 billion friends is not a privilege, it's a nightmare.",180,2022-06-29T15:44:54Z

@sejeongpretty7452,"11:42 I read somewhere on Twitter and completely agree with OP. Instead of thinking about what he would receive from his friend, Doyoung cares more about what he should give to them. He's not expecting anything in return if he never gave them anything. And that's one of the things that I love about Doyoung the most. He is a giver and prefers to give something to people first and then receive something in return rather than the other way around.
Most of them only think about the benefit of having a lot of friends, without considering that the more you get, the more you have to give",331,2022-06-23T03:17:59Z

@twisted_introvert,"Why does the poop debate, in particular, remind me of SVT's Debate Night series? 😆
Their debates were so funny!  I'm glad they enjoyed getting together and hearing and expressing various opinions.
(Alright Mr. Johnny ""that's because you're narrow minded"" Suh, as an introvert who's been in the situation of having a friend bring a ""+1 (or 3)"", let me open your own mind a bit.  It's got nothing to do w/ how broad my perspective is, it's got to do with my energy levels and how I function fundamentally.  I was mentally prepared to interact with one person and even with that prep & my love for my friend, it would be a drain on my energy.  Adding another into the mix throws me off and drains me even more.  ""The more the merrier,"" especially unexpectedly, is rarely an introvert's mindset and rather than gaining energy from interacting with others as extroverts do, it depletes my energy.  I'm with Jisung in that I'd be disappointed [and probably a little angry] w/ my friend.)",0,2022-06-10T17:32:36Z

@YutaIntroducedMe2SomeNewThangs,"I love that they include Jisung alone in all these new NCT contents. It gives him a chance to know all his hyungs better (after SM Rookies) and interact with them more when previously he was awkward with everyone but the dreamies. You can definitely see his growth and familiarity after the cooking episode and in this episode. He's more outspoken and confident and doesn't shy away as much.

Also love that Kun gets to join because WayV doesn't get as much attention, and especially Kun, doesn't get much chances to shine, so I'm glad they included him.",37,2022-05-28T15:44:21Z

I always thought Doyoung and I have so many similarities. And with this content, it is hereby declared that we are so the same, in so many ways. Getting to know that Doyoung is a Defender ISFJ (I, myself is a Defender ISFJ) makes me worry about him a lot. Defenders always feel a deep sense of responsibility to those around them, we always are willing to help others, be there for our loved ones without expecting anything in return. We are okay with us getting hurt but just don't hurt the people around us or we'll get crazy 😂 anyway, we are sensitive too but suffer silently. I just hope that someone will get to see through his eyes every time, even in his silence. 😅",2,2022-05-24T16:24:28Z

Beside that, make 2.2 billion friends is soooo tiring. And for the second question, he choosed B, because INFP wanna live a peaceful life.

@idkwtd5565,"as a psychology student, they really represents the mbti really well. i would like to point out the n vs s debate.  N stands for intuition  while S stands for sensing and its the way we perceive things. N has more imagination  and perceive the something beyond its physical appearance while S is more objective and looks more at the reality. as the question  was revealed, we can see how the Ns are more active in giving their opinion. its because the zombie situation is something you have to imagine, especially johnny who come up with all sorts of scenes. while the Ss we see somewhat cant really grasp the idea of zombies coming to their place and they gave like really general ideas of how theyll face the situation. while Ns actually talks like the zombies are coming and they could tell details of how theyre gonna face it.

thats all. however, as a reminder, mbti is one of the personality test that have a low validity and reliability. most psychologist dont really use it to assess someones personality. but it is the most famous one due to its easiness to interpret and its suitable for people who dont have a psychology background",344,2022-05-23T13:45:52Z

I am an ISFJ/ISFP and when I saw Doyoung's choice and listened to his argument, I resonated with it. I have always been the type to have a smaller group of friends so 2.2B sounds like way too much. Like Doyoung argued, I want to be able to put my effort into being a good friend and want the same reciprocation and that isn't going to happen with 2.2B people. Also, maybe I have been scorned by too many people that I considered my friend that I am more cautious as well.",11,2022-05-22T21:39:17Z

Each time I think NCT show can't get better, they beat my expectations. It really helped to know the members better, the questions were well-thought to provoke deeper reactions. I love it when the content makes them forget its content for a while. Sometimes it's not the answers per se, but the way they answer.
Harry Potter concept suited them well!

I liked the beginning when they were giving each other serious feedback about how they saw each other. It's especially nice to see a little more of Sungchan. There haven't been many opportunities of getting to know him. He seems more on the quiet, composed side, but not awkward and not afraid to talk if he has something to say. I feel like he might have a pretty cool self-deprecating sense of humour, playing a slytherin like that with confidence. 🙃 I hope he and Shotaro will soon be fixed members of permanent unit.

@4everlastingstarlight,"I noticed this, none of nct members have a extremely dominant percentage in their mbti traits. Like feelers are also use  thinking a lot or judgers have no problems at using perceiving in a moment of stress. I think this is one of the key elements how they can keep their friendship (talking about ones who knew each other for years) and teamwork. 

Ps: For ones who don't know percentages, no one depends on only one trait in their daily life. Feelers sometimes use thinking depending on the situation they're in, or introverts can get energised from a right crowd too. The results show which one is more dominant, for example if you are %10 introverted and %90 extroverted your mbti type will start with E however the result would be same if you're %48 introverted and %52 extroverted. This also makes an explanation for the fact people with the same type can be very different than each other",10,2022-05-21T19:07:38Z

They ask a lot of situational-type questions when applying for medical school and other programs, and while some are medical-related, there are random ones, too. So it's good to really test your mind, and create a critical mindset. It's good to see where your opinions lie, share them with others, and gain new perspectives, which may influence your own opinion. You learn more about yourself and others, and become more personable. Love this content from NCT! These members did amazing!",10,2022-05-21T18:13:40Z

@harvestmoon_autumnsky,"I need someone to show me some content where they actually are kind to DY.  Cause sometimes they are so mean, which I guess they might think is funny, that they come across as bullying jerks, especially Johnny, Yuta, TY and Jaehyun.  Other times I wonder if DY has a ""sweetheart"" persona in front of the cameras, but is arrogant off camera, and their teasing is their way to let the world know that he's not all he seems to be.  No one actually seems to like him at all.  I think Jeno is faking it, or putting up with it.    I guess my take is that you can't trust anything you see on screen about who they really are. DY is my bias not because he's the caring mom of the group, but just because I like his voice.  He is very talented, regardless of personality.",0,2022-05-21T17:16:48Z

Terus kalo temenku bawa temen tanpa pemberitahuan ini lebih kondisional aja kayaknya. Kalo cuma untuk ketemuan sekadar nongkrong aja gak apa-apa. Tapi kalo curhat, kayaknya aku bakalan kecewa juga.

Terus kalo masalah makan, aku juga kondisional, kalo udah terlalu laper, aku bakal makan apa aja yang terdekat dari tempat yang dituju kalo tempat itu tutup. Tapi kalo beneran lagi pengen banget, aku bakalan cari makanan sejenis meski jauh.",0,2022-05-21T16:41:59Z

But I am not upset because it taste like that, even me myself knows if I did cook good or not. I get upset because cooking takes time and effort😂I get to wash and chop everything for some time, my sweat is all over my face and in the end all I got were complaints?🤣 But I am also that person who’d rather be honest to someone if they cook and it taste no good, that is because how would they learn if you keep on telling em lies?what will be their progress if you will always say it is okay or it is good when it is not🤣 yes I am that type of person, I do not like ppl complaining about mine but I also prefer to be honest to others about their food😂🙈 maybe because of my pride?and maybe it is because of how the person reacts to it, if u say it is salty in a nice,non-offensive way why would I be upset right? but if my sister complains about my food, damn girl u better be chef Ramsay to have the audacity🤣👊",0,2022-05-21T15:15:23Z

@beyandat,"""All you are thinking is just giving of something to a friend. But you also get something in return. That's how friends are.""

Whoa. What Johnny said really amazes me. I love this kind of mentality. Friendship is not a one-way relationship. It's always a two-way interaction. You can't just give all that you have for a friend to the point that you lose yourself in the process. At the same time, you can't just always receive love and care from your friends all the time. You have to reciprocate, not out of duty, but out of appreciation towards them. Such beautiful insight from our Daddy Suh. 💚


DISCLAIMER: This is not, in any way, throwing shade or hate towards what Doyoung said. This comment is merely an appreciation towards Johnny's words of wisdom. Also, I hope Doyoung sees that he is not *obliged* to always give something to a friend, to single-handedly carry the friendship. He is so selfless that he even thought he should give extra effort. Honey, your members are with you. They will take care of you, love you, and appreciate you. It's always okay to accept love and care. You are not alone.

@raisha99,"My answers as an ISFP

Chapter ONE

Q1 (9:28)
Money ofc it's obvious. And realistically speaking, I don't think it's possible to interact with 2.2B people as your friends even being a celebrity.
Q2 (13:54)
A because I'll never in lay life eat shit. And even if I did and people don't know it'd still be embarrassing and I couldn't live with that. If there's rumor I'd just tell people I care about the truth and I trust they'd believe.

Chapter TWO

E vs I (16:32)
Like jisung said, I'd not be happy about it if they didn't say anything beforehand. But even if they did I wouldn't enjoy it that well either bcs I'm really awkward with new people. Tho I wouldn't say the feeling is disappointment, more like discomfort and awkwardness.

N vs S (18:53)
I'd evacuate ig? Idk I don't really like to think about the possibility of me personally experiencing the end of the world. This is the reason I don't really read or watch stuff with apocalyptic theme.

F vs T (22:49)
It really depends actually... If it's really bad I can't help my expression for sure and just be honest. But if it's not that bad I'd say ""it's ok ig"" or ""hmm not bad"". If there are other people besides me I'd hear their opinions first and give mine accordingly haha.

P vs J (24:37)
I'd go to nearby place bcs I don't like being on the road for too long. When traveling, the trip I have to make to go places is the most annoying part that makes me not like travelling. I never traveled alone before so the planning was always done by others, but if I'm gonna travel alone, I'd probably just make rough plan. I'd list the places I want to visit without really deciding the schedule and for food I'd just eat whatever nearby of places I'll be at.

@CatsAndOrchestra,"Doyoung saying 10:18 ""Then, that friend may say I GAVE you 40,00 won LAST TIME"" screams ISFJ/Si-dom!!!
The reason why Doyoung hold grudges is because of his dominant function, ""Si"" (introverted sensing). ISFJ and ISTJ are very good at reflecting past experiences, valuing tradition and routines, and stabilizing their life. ISFJs and ISTJs are can also describe past experiences in detail and give realistic and specific examples. 

However, this mindset can be sometimes frustrating for Ne and Ni-doms (ENFP, ENTP, INFJ, INTJ) since they are very future-oriented and prefers the bigger picture of things. You often see Johnny and Haechan arguing with Doyoung because they sometimes find the Si-dom mindset too past-oriented and inflexible. Their long friendship makes the combination work tho! 😊",62,2022-05-21T13:19:22Z
