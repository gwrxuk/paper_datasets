@Kailesious,That one group needs to have a comeback ASAP so their obsessed 8 years old fans can spend their free time there instead of yapping in other idols comsec. Seems like they are bored of their idols that's why they are here to feed their obsession.,2,2025-04-22T15:56:55Z

@hazeleyes-me,"Read this and don't believe in rumors:
1. As Rose said, she broke up in 2019. They stood together multiple times in 2020(no ex' do that). Would YG let them together if they were close?! NO
2. As the title says, ""Dandelion & Roses."" It's a flower name. Rose( its not even her REAL NAME)
3. Rose said she is SINGLE, so he is not her current.
4. He is not her EX. Since he was so chill singing her apt ft. Bruno song. Jaehyun sang Jisoo's flower too in 2023 because obviously NCT Doyoung and Jisoo are close since 2017.",9,2025-04-06T20:40:19Z

@jungoohappiness,"This song hasn't left my playlist since its release, it's a masterpiece, what a great artist you are, jaehyun. The entire album is a gem, beautiful songs and arrangements/instrumentals, R&B is for you man",23,2025-04-04T03:09:54Z
@jungoohappiness,"What kind of free hate is this that Jaehyun has been receiving in recent months due to a deduction from ""fans"", or rather, from people who have nothing to do? Anyone who's been in kpop for years knows that what's most there is theory and ship pulled out of the ass to link one artist to another, in a relationship or anything like that, but there are times when this goes beyond the limit. Doing all this cause of the name of a song (which is the most generic, not even specific) is fucked up and even worse is going to hate the guy without having any proof of anything, especially cause all the rumors are from fandom and there is no evidence, just like they spent years saying that this R was dating Suzy and to this day no one knows and just like they hated Jaden Smith when she released that bomb in the form of an album. I exaggerated the text cause this type of thing has been irritating me for a while now, even though I have been in the hallyu world for almost 8 years.",4,2025-04-04T02:42:27Z
@airasky668,"YG Leaker's claims are so justified now
Edit: I never said that what YG leaker said was true. I meant to say that the rumors of Jaehyun and Rose kinda make sense after all, justified means on a reasonable basis. So what I just said was that the claims have some kind of supporting evidence. I also didn't say they were actually dating. Tbh, I think YG leaker is a psycho and they also might be trying to make us forget about Kim Soo-hyun.",1,2025-04-04T02:11:20Z

2. As title says, ""Dandelion & Roses"" Its a fucking flower name. Rose( its not even her REAL NAME)
3. Rose said she is SINGLE, so he is not her current.
4. He is not her EX. Since he was so chill singing her apt ft. Bruno song. Jaehyun sang Jisoo's flower too in 2023 because obviously NCT Doyoung and jisoo are close since 2017.",7,2025-04-03T16:42:59Z

@thewizardrose,"Think I got it bad if I'm honest
Thought that I was good turns out I'm a little far from it yeah yeah
Can't even leave the apartment
Cause everything red's a cold reminder of you, like
You don't call me (yeah yeah)
You moved on like you'd had enough
(Say what?) and now the memories be hitting me differently
I'm six feet deep oh when I see
Roses (roses) Roses (roses)
It's killing me to know there's someone else out there buying you
Roses (roses) Roses yeah (roses)
I'm triggered every year Valentines
Don't wanna see no
Roses
Got me living in the past
Overthinking all your words
Maybe they were all lies
Quit me like a cigarette
Played me like a clarinet
See the river I'm crying
My heart is sore
From pulling out these thorns
These mended scars they reopen every time
Like you don't call me (yeah yeah)
You moved on like you'd had enough
And now the memories be hitting me differently
I'm six feet deep oh when I see
Roses (roses) Roses (roses)

@periz3057,"Ogni volta che ascolto la tua voce, è come un fuoco che mi avvolge. La passione che trasmetti in ogni nota è travolgente, come se cantassi direttamente all'anima. Il tuo talento non è solo musicale, è un'esperienza sensoriale completa: quel mix di carisma, sguardi intensi e movenze ipnotiche rende impossibile distogliere lo sguardo. Sei una tempesta di emozioni, capace di far vibrare ogni fibra del mio essere. Ogni canzone è una promessa sussurrata, ogni verso un brivido che corre lungo la pelle. Non canti, seduci. Non interpreti, vivi ogni parola con un’intensità che lascia senza fiato. Sei l’essenza della passione trasformata in melodia. Con te non è mai solo musica, è un viaggio che incendia l’anima. Sei pura arte viva.",0,2024-12-02T13:09:48Z

@annalog-hs4ch,"This is my most favourite song on the album. There's a lot to say about this song, not only the catchy melody, the addictive Jaehyun's voice and vibe, but also the story behind it. I'm an imaginative person, and I feel like this is the next chapter after Favourite - NCT 127, Lost and Forever Only. I don't know why but Jaehyun keeps giving me the vibe of a vampire guy, who has a tragic love with the one that he can't never have, he is the one who best represents the Favourite story. Coming to the second chapter - 'Lost', the period when he drowned his life in pain and solitude with the incessant nostalgia for the one he loved. In 'Forever Only' chapter, this is the time when he gave up his hopeless nostalgia, he decided to just reminisce the girl in mind and heart. And now after many years, 'Roses' here to represents his chaotic feelings: anger, animus, disappointment, despair, deep sorrow... Its was all the reasonable emotions to express the merciless truth of not having his love. The rose is also some kind of symbolic image that reminds Jaehyun of the girl, I believe. That's all I can say. That's all I want to say about this song, cause I believe a beautiful song like this deserves a comment like this, too.",10,2024-08-29T18:00:33Z

Think I got it bad if I'm honest
Thought that I was good turns out I'm a little far from it, yeah, yeah
Can't even leave the apartment
Cause everything red's a cold reminder of you
Like you don't call me (Yeah, yeah)
You moved on like you'd had enough (Say what?)
And now the memories be hitting me differently
I'm six feet deep, oh, when I see
Roses (Roses), roses (Roses)
It's killing me to know there's someone else out there buying you
Roses (Roses), roses, yeah (Roses)
I'm triggered every year Valentines, don't wanna see, no
Roses, roses
Roses, roses
Roses, roses
Roses, roses
Got me living in the past, overthinking all your words
Maybe they were all lies
Quit me like a cigarette, played me like a clarinet
See the river I'm crying
My heart is sore from pulling out these thorns
These mended scars they re-open every time
Like you don't call me, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
You moved on like you'd had enough
And now the memories be hitting me differently
I'm six feet deep, oh, when I see
Roses (Roses), roses (Roses)
It's killing me to know there's someone else out there buying you

@Pedi62,"“Since I first heard Roses, I've felt that the upcoming album is going to be very genuine. The emotions you convey through the melodies, the lyrics, and your expressions in the MV don't give off that feeling of, ""Oh, this is the song the company picked for you,"" or ""You were told to act like this or that in this part."" Of course, I don't want to idealize everything. I'm well aware that many musicians or PDs or experts were involved in the production of your album. But thankfully, their contributions have only enhanced your unique colors. It's something I’m soooo grateful for.

I don't know if this is too much to ask, but I hope that the emotions you pour into the love songs you sing come, at least in part, from real experiences outside of the spotlight. Your career doesn't allow you the time or freedom for dating, but I still hope you've found a way to sneak through a small gap, allowing this beautiful feeling to reach your heart. Jaehyun, you have such a warm heart and eyes filled with love for everything— someone like that deserves to love and be loved.

To me, Smoke feels like the first page of a book our Jaehyunie is eager to write. Beyond being NCT 127 member and having that well-known perfectly sculpted appearance, it seems like you want to show the world that you can be even bolder and capable to conquer so much more. So, I'm really excited to see what's next because, honestly, your potential is limitless.”

Actually I intended to write this down and keep it to myself, but after watching Lee Mujin Service, I felt the urge to share it somewhere. Who knows, maybe one magical day, Jaehyun will find comfort from what I felt, just as I always find comfort from his music.",21,2024-08-27T18:31:13Z

@kevinjean8151,"Intro]
Think I should text my ex

[Verse 1]
Think I got it bad if I'm honest
Thought that I was good turns out I'm a little far from it, yeah, yeah
Can't even leave the apartment
'Cause everything red's a cold reminder of you

[Pre-Chorus]
Like you don't call me (Yeah, yeah)
You moved on like you'd had enough (Say what?)
And now the memories be hitting me differently
I'm six feet deep, oh, when I see

[Chorus]
Roses (Roses), roses (Roses)
It's killing me to know there's someone else out there buying you
Roses (Roses), roses, yeah (Roses)
I'm triggered every year Valentines, don't wanna see, no

[Post-Chorus]
Roses, roses
Roses, roses
Roses, roses
Roses, roses

[Verse 2]
Got me living in the past, overthinking all your words
Maybe they were all lies
Quit me like a cigarette, played me like a clarinet
See the river I'm crying
My heart is sore from pulling out these thorns
These mended scars they re-open every time

[Pre-Chorus]
Like you don't call me, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
You moved on like you'd had enough
And now the memories be hitting me differently
I'm six feet deep, oh, when I see

[Chorus]
Roses (Roses), roses (Roses)
It's killing me to know there's someone else out there buying you
Roses (Roses), roses (Roses)
I'm triggered every year Valentines, don't wanna see, no

[Post-Chorus]
(Roses) Oh, no
(Roses) You wanna be mine, baby (Roses)
(Roses) I said you wanna be mine, baby (Roses)
(Roses) You wanna be mine, yeah (Roses)
(Roses) I bet you wanna be mine",0,2024-08-26T13:03:09Z
