XIAOJUN’S expression changing was so priceless, cute & funny!! 🤣🤣 But he was such a trooper whenever Jaemin told him to do something!! 👏 And YUTA was so sincere with the back hug, 3 beautiful things said at the end, and how he kept telling Xiaojun he could call whenever he needed to throughout the episode!! 🥰 THIS is why YUTA is my ultimate bias in NCT!! ,That man’s heart is so genuine, loving & caring!! I swear I hope he will be blessed with a life partner that will love him unconditionally like I’m sure he will give to that lucky person…YUTA deserves someone like that!! I’m not delusional enough to believe it would ever be me, but if I could find someone like him, I’d consider myself so blessed! 😉🥰👏👏👏💚🎶🎵🎤💚♥️",5,2021-12-20T01:27:57Z

@sporeKAfan,Honestly Xiaojun is not awkward with Yuta. People are just reading too much into that video clip where they interacted backstage. The members that he publicly admitted to being awkward are Jaemin and Jeno but I see nothing wrong with that. It is not possible to be close to every member in a large group and not everyone is a social butterfly.,42,2021-12-17T14:48:52Z

@fearthhereaper9997,People tend to forget that Xiaojun was an NCT fan before joining the group so he's probably still very starstruck by them hence he's 'awkward' and also he's just very shy in general. I'm really glad he's been getting out of his shell lately and is interacting with members more freely,22,2021-12-16T23:10:24Z

Amazing combination really.

@AraMila,"YuJun are really a visual attack duo and them in flower crowns with chokers definitely proves it. Also Yuta did god’s work by thinking of putting it as a choker.

Yuta is so precious tho, like he always knows how to make people feel good and is attentive, his emotional awareness is very high and he gives the best compliments effortlessly.

Xiaojun is such an awkward guy, he always makes things entertaining and his helpless face is everything lmao.
Also Jaemin and Xiaojun seem really close and their chemistry is very good, it surprised me will be looking out for these two from now on.",48,2021-12-16T15:02:43Z

Yuta really tried hard to give sincere remarks and make Dejun as comfortable as possible, and even cheered the MCs up.
Xiaojun the sweetest☺️ I already thought he was more prone to skinship than he tries to show, it was cute how he just went with the flow.
Jaemin and Johnny behind their backs were like devils on their shoulders😹
