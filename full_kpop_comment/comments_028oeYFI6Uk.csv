Seungkwan: VOICE GOALS!! Makes me question my own voice
Vernon: SHFLSIJOAIJSFIJOJAIVJPJ *<--- Me being speechless*

So, S.Coups is wearing a red ""scarf""- i suppose that's what it is, attached to his trousers. So far so good. He dances, etc, until 0.32 when we can see that the scarf is lying on the floor in the background, probably because it's fallen off. Then at 0.35, it's attached to his trousers again, but at 0.36, it's still on the floor. At 0.38, one of the members( jeonghan i think) picks it up discretely, then we see s.coups dancing with it, and then, AGAIN, at 0.40 it's lying on the floor !

Seventeen Yob! You Know What?

These days, I have a lot of thoughts
These days, I have so much to tell you (these days)

I feel weird, I’m not talking as much
My friends are all worried (these days)
My heart races only when I’m in front of you
So I’m sorry about my clumsy actions

I still can’t control it
Please don’t play with me
Why are you keeping a front?
I don’t know, I don’t know what will happen

So what I mean is, I want to know all of you
I’ll sing you, U Hoo, I’ll sing you, U Hoo
Even if my lips are dry, I need to say this baby
I adore you, I adore you, enough to get dizzy

(Adore you) these days. I (these days)
(Adore you) these days, I (these days)

How can you dazzle so much?
You’re so pretty it’s selfish but your personality is so humble
This is not the place to joke around
I’m announcing the fact about your charms

Is it because I like how you smile at me?
Or do I just seem light to you?

Yeh, if you’re finding a spot
Yeh, right next to me is good
Yeh, I have a lot of interest in you
Even your shoe size oh oh

I’m on fire right now because of you
It’s impossible to cool me down
I’m on fire right now because of you
I don’t know, I don’t know, it’ll happen somehow

So what I mean is, I want to know all of you
I’ll sing you, U Hoo, I’ll sing you, U Hoo
Even if my lips are dry, I need to say this baby
I adore you, I adore you, enough to get dizzy

(Adore you) these days. I (these days)
(Adore you) these days, I (these days)

You can lean right here
You can cover your pain with me

Tell me your feelings
Don’t hold back, it’s not enough
Can’t fake it no more
Crank up the speed
Stop playing hard to get
Now let me call you

Baby you’re my angel, I want to know all of you
I’ll sing you, U Hoo, I’ll sing you, U Hoo
Even if my lips are dry, I need to say this baby
I adore you, I adore you, enough to get dizzy

(Adore you) these days. I (these days)

@tatamigaIaxy,"Jeonghan in those cuts when they were sitting on the car was so friggin pretty. I swear, this amount of gorgeousness is impossible to achieve. I biased him long ago during 17TV, but diverged a bit. I actually could not believe that the gorgeous long haired beauty was Yoon Junghan. I remember Doyoon, Samuel, Chinese cutie MingMing, and Dongjin, and waking up at 4 AM watching 17TV live, when I should've slept more. I am so proud of these amazing, unbelievably talented boys. I think Seungcheol and Jeonghan changed the most, from what I've seen 2-3 years ago. I also prefer this version over the actual MV. Seventeen fighting! I hope Pledis promotes them well, because they deserve to be much more well known for all the talent in each one of the boys.",1,2015-06-08T05:30:52Z
