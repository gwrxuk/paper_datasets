One reason I really fell into a rabbit hole was because when I googled to find out who the heck JK was I read about them going into the military, think this was just a few days before they went in. I was so freaked out that this Kpop band had been conscripted to go into the military that I went into a frenzied googling about them and actually haven't emerged yet. So the haircut was hard to watch, also coming of the back of the final episode of 'Are you sure?' this week with Jimin & JK on enlistment day.

Then I watched EVERY SINGLE EPISODE of Run BTS ( like around 156 eps) and then In The Soop etc. We are HOOKED ON BTS and especially on Jungkook! We live in Las Vegas which has a lot of retirees and went to the theater to see this movie on a Wednesday afternoon. The audience was from apx 40ish and older. What surprised and pleased us was everyone singing along with JKs songs! I mean LOUDLY singing and clapping. Knowing every word etc! We were so jazzed! It was an incredible, lovely experience we wouldn't have missed for anything! Jungkook literally IS  a global pop star. The next MJ for real! I bought the Jungkook cup and now I have it with 2 of the cards they gave us also. I put it with his Golden album and will treasure it. I adore this talented, sweet young man.
