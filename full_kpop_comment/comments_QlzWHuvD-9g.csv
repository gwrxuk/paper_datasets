I hope that it is released another way so I (and others) can see it. I'm pretty sure I would be crying at the end too.  Watching his last live before he went into the military was hard because you could tell he wasn't himself.  It still makes me sad that he did not have a chance to ride the wave of his Golden time.

I was so freaked out that this Kpop band had been conscripted to go into the military that I went into a frenzied googling about them and actually haven't emerged yet.

Have been to all of their movies/documentaries and the thing I love most is getting to be in a space with ARMY.  So many of us feel isolated - reading comments below where others are saying they went to the cinema alone is just so sad.  I have a BTS logo on my bag and it is really amazing when I bump into the occasional (usually much younger) ARMY who see it and we get to fangirl together, them mainly having never met another ARMY!!!  I am blessed to have my BFF who loves the guys as much as I do.  Much love Jose from Australian ARMY, 67 years old.  Borahae and Apobangpo 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜",1,2024-09-22T05:15:27Z,,0

There was a lady and older one sitting a few seats from me and she was singing with me and even doing some of the choreo. We were the only two doing it. I hope next week more people will join in.😊

Agree with you, everyone in the theater with me had the same reaction at the end. We cried. We laughed. Emotional overload filled the room through the entire film.

No other performer I've seen on that show watched it back (Jk watched all his takes in its entirety mind you!). Best of all, the way he used up his time to try to interact with fans because he GENUINELY wants to and loves ARMY so much....😭He was so sweet and kind to everyone there; the staff, the fans... it really touched me as a long-time ARMY to see him be the guy we all know him to be.

We knew what was coming. Being part of that collective emotional moment made me feel that special Army feeling.  It was an outstanding documentary. It showed the professional, hard-working side of JK, the nervous side at the doctor's office and not feeling well, and the goofy kid-side when he was skipping down the hallway with Mr. Lee beside him.  What treasures we have in JK, and all the members.",177,2024-09-21T19:31:15Z,,0

Then I watched EVERY SINGLE EPISODE of Run BTS ( like around 156 eps) and then In The Soop etc. We are HOOKED ON BTS and especially on Jungkook! We live in Las Vegas which has a lot of retirees and went to the theater to see this movie on a Wednesday afternoon. The audience was from apx 40ish and older. What surprised and pleased us was everyone singing along with JKs songs! I mean LOUDLY singing and clapping. Knowing every word etc! We were so jazzed! It was an incredible, lovely experience we wouldn't have missed for anything! Jungkook literally IS  a global pop star. The next MJ for real! I bought the Jungkook cup and now I have it with 2 of the cards they gave us also. I put it with his Golden album and will treasure it. I adore this talented, sweet young man. And I'm not too old to notice he's also very cute and HOT

I have favored songs that he’s done but my favorite has to be still with you.
