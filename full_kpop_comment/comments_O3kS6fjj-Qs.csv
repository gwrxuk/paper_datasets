I've been holding my breath
I've been counting to ten
Over something you said
I've been holding back tears
While you're throwing back beers
I'm alone in bed
You know I, I'm afraid of change
Guess that's why we stay the same
So tell me to leave
I'll pack my bags, get on the road
Find someone that loves you
Better than I do, darling, I know
'Cause you remind me every day
I'm not enough, but I still stay
Feels like a lifetime
Just trying to get by while we're dying inside
I've done a lot of things wrong
Loving you being one
But I can't move on
You know I, I'm afraid of change
Guess that's why we stay the same
So tell me to leave

@sopinasiandini3557,"I've been holding my breath
I've been counting to ten
Over something you said
I've been holding back tears
While you're throwing back beers
I'm alone in bed
You know I, I'm afraid of change
Guess that's why we stay the same
So tell me to leave
I'll pack my bags, get on the road
Find someone that loves you
Better than I do, darling, I know
'Cause you remind me every day
I'm not enough, but I still stay
Feels like a lifetime
Just trying to get by while we're dying inside
I've done a lot of things wrong
Loving you being one
But I can't move on
You know I, I'm afraid of change
Guess that's why we stay the same
So tell me to leave
I'll pack my bags, get on the road
Find someone that loves you
Better than I do, darling, I know
'Cause you remind me every day
I'm not enough, but I still stay
If you want me to leave
Then tell me to leave and baby I'll go
You remind me every day
I'm not enough, but I still stay",3,2024-11-19T06:01:28Z

I've been counting to ten
Over something you said
I've been holding back tears
While you're throwing back beers
I'm alone in bed
You know I, I'm afraid of change
Guess that's why we stay the same
So tell me to leave
I'll pack my bags, get on the road
Find someone that loves you
Better than I do, darling, I know
'Cause you remind me every day
I'm not enough, but I still stay
Feels like a lifetime
Just trying to get by while we're dying inside
I've done a lot of things wrong
Loving you being one
But I can't move on
You know I, I'm afraid of change
Guess that's why we stay the same
So tell me to leave
I'll pack my bags, get on the road
Find someone that loves you

I had the opportunity of meeting a lot of artists even those that I didn’t even like but the day I met new jeans it felt like I was just talking with a group of besties that got the opportunity to be idols. Like it wasn’t me being delusional or them doing fan service. It was a genuinely and honest conversation. Kind people always have it the hardest but I hope everyone of them get to archive their dreams and goals in life. Keep fighting Newjeans!💘",2,2024-11-15T22:20:47Z

다니야 하니야 정말 많이 아낀다 항상 건강하자.

난 숨을 참고 있었어
I've been holding my breath

나는 10까지 세고 있었어
I've been counting to ten

당신이 말한 것에 대해
Over something you said

눈물을 참아왔어
I've been holding back tears

네가 맥주를 던지는 동안
While you're throwing back beers

나는 침대에 혼자 있어
I'm alone in bed
알잖아 난 변화를 두려워해
You know I, I'm afraid of change

그게 우리가 같은 모습을 유지하는 이유인 것 같아
Guess that's why we stay the same
그러니 떠나라고 말해줘
So tell me to leave

나는 가방을 싸서 길을 떠날 거야
I'll pack my bags, get on the road

당신을 사랑하는 사람을 찾아봐
Find someone that loves you

나보다 낫지, 자기야, 나도 알아
Better than I do, darling, I know

왜냐면 넌 매일 나에게 상기시켜주거든
'Cause you remind me every day

난 부족하지만 여전히 남아있어
I'm not enough, but I still stay
평생 같은 느낌
Feels like a lifetime

우리가 안에서 죽어가는 동안 그냥 지내려고 노력 중이야
Just trying to get by while we're dying inside

내가 나쁜 짓을 많이 했어
I've done a lot of things wrong

당신이 하나가 되어 사랑해
Loving you being one

하지만 난 계속 나아갈 수 없어
But I can't move on
알잖아 난 변화를 두려워해
You know I, I'm afraid of change

그게 우리가 같은 모습을 유지하는 이유인 것 같아
Guess that's why we stay the same

If you want me to leave

그럼 나한테 떠나라고 말하면 내가 갈게
Then tell me to leave and baby I'll go

NewJeans is a whole universe, and you can't break it! Adult uncles and aunts, stop ruining this! And give to those who are given what they have earned.

@하핳-l6z,보통의 아이돌들은 7년간의 계약기간이 끝난후 많은 시행착오를 겪으며 오랜시간이 지나 자신의 색을 찾은 아티스트로 인정받는 경우가 많음..하지만 뉴진스는..이미..그 모든 과정을 다 겪어온것같은 느낌이 든다..이미 그 과정을 겪고 지나쳐온 아티스트라고 느껴짐..이 아이들의 재능이 얼마나 대단한지..한편으론 다른 아이돌들도 좀더 빨리 자신의 색과 길을 찾을 방법이 있을텐데도 기획사의 육성방식에 갇혀 빛을 보지못하고있진않은가 생각이 들기도함..민대표는 지난 시간 그걸봐오면서 다른 방식의 길을 꿈꿔온걸지도..그게 뉴진스를 만든것같음.대퓨님과 뉴진스가  자유로워지길..뉴진스 네버다이!!!!!!!!!!!,433,2024-11-15T10:52:27Z

@mamamememoo,"Lyrics: 

I've been holding my breath
I've been counting to ten
Over something you said
I've been holding back tears
While you're throwing back beers
I'm alone in bed
You know I, I'm afraid of change
Guess that's why we stay the same
So tell me to leave
I'll pack my bags, get on the road
Find someone that loves you
Better than I do, darling, I know
'Cause you remind me every day
I'm not enough, but I still stay
Feels like a lifetime
Just trying to get by while we're dying inside
I've done a lot of things wrong
Loving you being one
But I can't move on
You know I, I'm afraid of change
Guess that's why we stay the same
So tell me to leave
I'll pack my bags, get on the road
Find someone that loves you
Better than I do, darling, I know
'Cause you remind me every day
I'm not enough, but I still stay
If you want me to leave
Then tell me to leave and baby I'll go
You remind me every day
I'm not enough, but I still stay",1,2024-11-15T10:50:56Z
