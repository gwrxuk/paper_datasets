Chastened by the criticism, Meta set out to shore up its defenses. It hired 40,000 content moderators around the world, invested heavily in building new technology to analyze content for potential harms and flag it for review, and became the world’s leading funder of third-party fact-checking organizations.

The people that came in, they're eating the cats. They're eating — they're eating the pets of the people that live there.""

But this is wrong: Those gates were never really closed. The idea that something called “fact-checking” could be (or could have been) reasonably applied to social-media posts, in aggregate, is absurd.

Zuckerberg characterised it as a “cultural tipping point, towards once again prioritising speech”.

Stopping factchecking at a time of massive disinformation is a bit like pulling down a Los Angeles fire station during a major fire: you don’t know whether the fire station would have been enough to contain the fire, but you are certainly depriving yourself of a proven and valuable tool to fight it. But that’s the decision taken by Meta, initially in the United States, as a possible precursor to stopping factchecking the world over. With the world’s broadest factchecking network, comprising 150 full-time factcheckers working in around 30 countries and in 26 languages, AFP is the most affected by this U-turn.

Such abuses include various ways to manipulate public opinion: dissemination of disinformation or misinformation, use of bot farms, abuse of personal data of users for micro-targeting, etc. This recognition was rather a forced response to criticism than a proactive step on the part of the company.

Chapman Rivera/Waves Ahead) Share Tweet Eliana Rodríguez and her father Javier floated on a mattress and pieces of broken debris in flood water in Utuado, Puerto Rico, praying help would come for hours. “The rain kept falling and never stopped,” Rodríguez said of the flood water that filled the home she shared with her father. “We sat in the dark when we lost power and when the water became too much, we prayed.” Hurricane Fiona made landfall on Puerto Rico’s southwestern coast on Sept. 18, inundating Utuado and the surrounding area with 30 inches of rain. Neighbors eventually rescued Rodríguez and her father. They have now relocated to New York with family, unsure when or if they will return. Rodríguez still grieves for the things she lost in the flood that made her house a home. “ Mi isla es mi alma (my island is my soul),” Rodríguez said, choking back tears.

By Ryan Mac Facebook’s parent company, Meta Platforms, has been sued over the 2020 killing of a federal security guard, a move that aims to challenge a federal statute that shields websites and social media platforms from liability for what users post. The lawsuit, filed on Wednesday by Angela Underwood Jacobs, the guard’s sister, argued that Facebook was responsible for connecting individuals who sought to harm law enforcement officers and sow civil discord. Ms. Jacobs’s brother, Dave Patrick Underwood, who served at a federal building and courthouse in Oakland, Calif., was shot and killed in May 2020 by an Air Force sergeant with antigovernment ties, according to the F.B.I. The shooting “was the culmination of an extremist plot hatched and planned on Facebook by two men who Meta connected through Facebook’s groups infrastructure and its use of algorithms designed and intended to increase user enga..."
